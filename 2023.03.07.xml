      <cwn_title>Watch.ocaml.org: out of beta, and a call for new videos</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/watch-ocaml-org-out-of-beta-and-a-call-for-new-videos/11561/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Anil Madhavapeddy announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The *https://watch.ocaml.org* video site is now promoted to a production quality ocaml.org site, as
[discussed](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-org-recapping-2022-and-queries-on-the-fediverse/11099) at the start of the year
(doesn't that seem like a long time ago?)   For those interested, this means that the software stack is now part of the
deploy.ci.ocaml.org pipeline (see [ocaml/infrastructure#23](https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/issues/23) and the [infra@ocaml
blogpost](http://infra.ocaml.org/2023/02/27/watch-ocaml-org.html).)

Now that this is done, it's a good time to put a call out to any other interested OCaml meetups, workshops or conferences that also
want to host OCaml related content.  See the [watch/about](https://watch.ocaml.org/about/instance#terms) page for more information
about how that works.  If you do have a stream of videos (historical, or recent, both are good), then we can mirror it there or host
it directly.  As a reminder, anyone on a ActivityPub-compliant service (such as Mastodon) can follow channels hosted on the service
and leave comments.

Thanks to @mtelvers @patricoferris @cuihtlauac @sabine for loads of ocaml.org updates as well to make this possible! That was lots
of work, but https://ocaml.org/community now links to the site and each workshop page should be up-to-date back to 2012.

      <cwn_title>Companies using OCaml‚Äìstaffing/recruitment/training?</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/companies-using-ocaml-staffing-recruitment-training/11562/2</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Yawar Amin asked and Nicolas Ojeda Bar replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
#+begin_quote
I am curious about something. There are many companies using OCaml, some of them very successful and famous. Others more obscure.
They all obviously have one thing in common‚Äìthey need to employ developers to maintain their OCaml codebase.
#+end_quote

I can tell you a little bit from my experience at LexiFi. (This is strictly my personal opinion, and in no way it should be
understood as an official statement of any kind.)

#+begin_quote
My question is, how have they been finding developers for a niche language?
#+end_quote

Most programmers hired at LexiFi already know some (or a lot) of OCaml. Often, they have a two-year Master program in CS (called
"M2" in France) or an Engineering degree under their belt, where they learn OCaml, but this is not a requirement. Typically, we
advertise the position in the usual places, and candidates send in their applications. A few remarks:

- For the last couple of years, hiring was noticeably tight. My feeling is that this was in large part due to certain blockchain-backed companies in France siphoning a disproportionally large number of OCaml programmers off the market. I say "was" because since the recent bitcoin downturn, we have seen a noticeable increase in the number of good candidates, and hiring has loosened up again.
- We are a small team, so don't need to hire more than one or two people at a time. I am not sure what the situation would look like if we wished to hire tens of programmers at one time.

Also, our experience may be a bit particular because we are based in France, where (I guess) the supply of OCaml programmers is
higher than average.

#+begin_quote
I‚Äôve heard that Jane Street has developed a 2-week crash course and many internal tools, idioms, and best practices.
#+end_quote

We haven't had to onboard many programmers who did not know OCaml before, so we don't have a dedicated training program. We try to
document workflows, but the truth is that a lot of the institutional knowledge about the code is not written down anywhere, and new
hires learn it by talking to people around them. This probably works as long as your team is relatively small, but will not scale
beyond a certain point, which is why more structured onboarding processes are needed in larger companies.

As another data point, our "quant" team, which consists entirely of quantitative programmers which typically arrive to LexiFi with
little or no OCaml experience, developed a "crash course in OCaml". New arrivals typically go through it to get up to speed so that
they can start contributing to the codebase. On the other hand, quant programmers have very specific skills and don't typically
"roam" over the whole codebase, so it is easier to tune their training for the kind of tasks they will be doing.

#+begin_quote
I‚Äôve also heard of some companies which had to move away from OCaml (or Reason/ReScript) codebases due to the usually cited
reason‚Äìlack of support.
#+end_quote

This would be unthinkable at LexiFi; we use OCaml for everything, are are fully invested in it. But I can see how this could be a
problem in a company where OCaml knowledge is the reserve of a small number of people.

#+begin_quote
How are companies in general convincing good developers to join, learn OCaml, stay on in the job instead of flying to greener
pastures, and building up engineering continuity with training/documentation so that their whole OCaml codebase is not at the mercy
of one or two engineers deciding to stay or leave?
#+end_quote

I can only hypothesize about my colleagues, but my personal feeling is that I'm quite happy to be able to make a living programming
in OCaml, so this acts as an incentive to remain, rather than to leave. More generally, for whatever reason, the turnover at LexiFi
is extremely low, so we haven't had to deal with issues stemming from high churn rate. I think it would definitively be a problem if
this were to happen.

      <cwn_what>
The [recently released](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-7-0/11474) Dune 3.7.0 includes native support for _watch mode_ on
Windows. This feature was implemented by a student, Uma Kothuri of the US, who interned at LexiFi last year for this project.

To mark the [upstreaming](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7010) of the feature, we wrote a brief technical note about it, which
you can find at https://www.lexifi.com/blog/ocaml/dune-watch-mode-windows/. Don't hesitate to take a look if you would like to get
an overview of how the feature is implemented.

      <cwn_who>Romain Beauxis announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Hi all!

Liquidsoap ~2.1.4~ is out: https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases/tag/v2.1.4 ! üéâ

Liquidsoap Rolling Release ~2.2.x~ is now available: https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases/tag/rolling-release-v2.2.x ! üéâ

The ~2.1.4~ release contains important bug fixes, including a last-minute memory issue with http requests and queries that was
introduced in ~2.1.3~. All users are encouraged to migrate to it but make sure to use a staging environment before pushing to
production just in case! Full changelog is [here](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/blob/v2.1.4/CHANGES.md#214-2022-03-01)

Next, we would like to shift our focus to the ~2.2.x~ release cycle. We are done with the changes there and will now focus on fixing
issues there. We do encourage new projects to start with it and users to report issues. We will prioritize these issues over other
ones.

The ~2.2.x~ release contains some exciting changes, in particular a switch to ~dune~ as the build system and a new support for
multitrack decoder/demuxing/muxing/encoding. You can read more about it [here](https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/multitrack.html).
Full changelog is [here](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/blob/main/CHANGES.md#220-unreleased).

Dear users (of the opam-repository in particular, but also of the container images and various other pieces of infrastructure that
we publish from ocaml.org),

After that mouthful of an intro, just a brief note to solicit opinions over at
[ocaml/infrastructure#20](https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/issues/20#issuecomment-1455150998) on what would be most useful to
users of the opam-repo on what sort of change tracking would be most useful for you to find out what's breaking (or has been fixed)
as the live infrastructure evolves.

There's a lot of improvements going in thanks to all the contributions to the [various CIs](https://github.com/ocurrent/overview),
and your inputs on that issue, or this thread, would be welcome.

Hi, I've just released a VS Code extension to integrate [PPX Expect](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect) and [PPX Inline
Test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_inline_test) to VS Code.
It also works in combination with [Alcotest Test
Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)

[Expect and Inline Tests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)
[GitHub: VS Code Expect and Inline Tests](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)

It always adds/updates/deletes expect and inline tests when opening or saving an OCaml source file. By default, it also runs all
inline tests of all inline test runners to discover tests on startup. If this takes too long or you don't like that, you can disable
that behavior in the settings. The ~Refresh Tests~ button in the upper right of the Test Explorer view also runs all expect and
inline tests to fill the tree.

I'm happy to announce [~ppx_minidebug~](https://github.com/lukstafi/ppx_minidebug):
- Which is a syntax extension to instrument type-annotated bindings and functions with logging.
- The extension supports 3 value conversion mechanisms: ~pp~ and ~show~ from ~deriving.show~, and ~sexp~ from ~ppx_sexp_conv~.
- The ~minidebug_runtime~ package provides 3 logging backends: ~Format~ based purely on formatters, ~Flushing~ that converts to strings first and flushes output after every entry, and ~PrintBox~ that pretty-prints as trees using the ~printbox~ package.
- I reference a VS Code extension that builds flame graphs for the ~Flushing~ logger out-of-the-box.
