* ppx_tyre and new version of ppx_regexp

** Gabriel Radanne announced


A while ago, I released [[https://drup.github.io/2016/08/12/tyre/][Tyre]], a
library for typesafe regular expressions that supports matching, printing, and
routing. @paurkedal also released
[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppx-regexp-0-2-0-and-0-3-0/344][ppx_regex]]
which provides a convenient syntax for defining regular expression matches using
a PCRE syntax.

Today, we are happy to announce the release of
[[https://github.com/paurkedal/ppx_regexp#ppx_tyre---syntax-support-for-tyre-routes][ppx_tyre]],
which combines the flexibility and safety of tyre with the convenience of
ppx_regexp. This also marks new releases of both tyre and ppx_regexp with
improvements and bugfixes. You can find more details in the following blogpost.

* Help needed about the OCaml MOOC

** Yann Régis-Gianas announced


Dear OCaml hackers and enthusiasts,

we need your help! The third edition of the OCaml MOOC will start in
three weeks and that's probably the perfect opportunity for your
friends and all your acquaintances to discover the beauty of
functional programming in OCaml. Please, take a minute to spread the word
around you!

Three possible actions:

1. Convince everyone you know to register at https://tinyurl.com/ocamooc3
2. Print, post and share our flyer https://tinyurl.com/ocamooc3flyer
3. Post the announcement message which is pasted at the end of this email. It can also be found here https://gist.github.com/yurug/406b1cf63f083fd6aab76fb646aa3e39

Thank you!

Roberto Di Cosmo, Yann Régis-Gianas and Ralf Treinen.

*** Learn functional programming with the OCaml programming language
*** Registrations are open!

Functional programming is attracting interest from a broad range of
developers because it allows to write expressive, concise and elegant
programs.

The course "Introduction to Functional programming using the OCaml
language" introduces gradually the central notions of functional
programming, via a set of video courses that are complemented by a
rich set of interesting exercises that you can perform fully in your
browser... Yes, this means you can start learning functional
programming without any hassle: nothing to install, nothing to tune
up! The programming environment is just one click away!

During the course, you will discover powerful mechanisms that allow to
build and manipulate complex data structures in a clean and efficient way.
And you will see how functions play a central role, as first-class values
that can be freely used in any place where an _expression_ can appear.

Registrations are already open at

https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:parisdiderot+56002+session03/about

The course will start on September 17th 2018, and will run for six weeks.

Your expected effort is between 2 and 6 hours per week, depending on your
background, including the time spent watching the short video sequences
of the course, that total approximately an hour per week.

This may seem a significant effort, but at the end of the course you will
have actually learned a lot: the final programming project will confirm
that you acquired a good mastery of functional programming and the ability
to develop medium sized programs with ease.

Thousands of learners attended the first two runs of this course in
2015 and 2016, and the many that completed it were extremely
satisfied.

To introduce you to functional programming, we have chosen to use the
OCaml programming language. OCaml is a rich, elegant, efficient programming
language that reconciles the conciseness and flexibility of untyped
programming languages (like Python, for example) with the safety of
strongly typed programming languages (like Java, for example), and that has
a vibrant user community.

Facebook, Microsoft, JaneStreet, Bloomberg are some big names in
industry that adopted OCaml to develop cutting edge applications. The
research community uses OCaml for writing tools like the proof
assistant Coq, the Coccinelle program transformer, the Frama-C code
analyser, or the Astree static analyser.  Several start ups use OCaml
to obtain tenfold gains in productivity and stability of their code
base. Recently, Tezos, one of the most innovative blockchains, has
developed its entire software stack using OCaml to get high insurance
about the execution of smart contracts.

Once you have started mastering functional programming using OCaml, we are
sure that other programming languages will never look the same to you
again.

This course will be held in English, but subtitles are already available
in English, in Portuguese and in French.

*** Prerequisites

To take full advantage of this course you should have already some basic
knowledge of computer programming, in particular you should already know
how to write simple computer programs in some programming language. For
instance, you should know concepts like variables (or identifiers),
functions (or procedures, methods), conditionals, and loops.

* UTop has successfully moved to ocaml-comminuty

:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:

** Jérémie Dimino announced


I'm happy to announce that [[https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop][utop]] has successfully moved to [[https://github.com/ocaml-community/manifesto][ocaml-community]].

We started moving utop and two of its dependencies a week ago and activity on
these 3 projects has already increased., in particular with several patches to
modernize them. This is an encouraging start for the ocaml-community
organization!
      

** Perry E. Metzger then added


Also moved are [[https://github.com/ocaml-community/lambda-term][lambda term]] and
[[https://github.com/ocaml-community/zed][zed]], and there is now a CI mechanism
for all three projects (and will be for all ocaml-community stuff going
forward.)

* 6th MirageOS hack retreat - October 3rd - 10th in Marrakesh (Morocco)

:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/6th-mirageos-hack-retreat-october-3rd-10th-in-marrakesh-morocco/2461/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


It is an entire week of designing, chasing bugs, coding, with a reasonably large
group of MirageOS hackers. Similar to earlier retreats, it will take place in
the medina of Marrakesh. There is no schedule, but ad-hoc sessions (talks and/or
workshops) are appreciated. If you're interested, find more information in
reports from earlier retreats (see
https://linse.me/2018/04/20/Visiting-the-camels.html and
https://mirage.io/blog/2017-winter-hackathon-roundup and
http://ollehost.dk/blog/2017/03/17/travel-report-mirageos-hack-retreat-in-marrakesh-2017/
and even more on http://retreat.mirage.io).

Everybody is welcome, it is usually a mix of MirageOS&OCaml experts and new people, which leads to a good knowledge transfer.  Please sign up soon via mail, see details at http://retreat.mirage.io

* Introduction Sketch.sh: An interactive sketchbook for OCaml and ReasonML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5

** Khoa Nguyen announced


Hello everyone, over the past few months, I've been working on a little project called [[https://sketch.sh/][Sketch.sh]]. It's a interactive notebook style (like IPython and Jupyter). 

https://discourse-cdn-sjc2.com/standard11/uploads/ocaml/original/2X/0/01666dc68fab382762ee73700654673aafdea870.png

It uses Js_of_ocaml's toplevel to evaluate the code completely in browsers. You can save/share the sketch with a url as well.

I created this with the hope to lower the bar for learning OCaml/ReasonML in general. There are a lot of sketch made by people who is learning the language already! 

The project is [[https://github.com/Sketch-sh/sketch-sh][open source on Github]] so check it out.

* Bounty for compilation cache in opam
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/bounty-for-compilation-cache-in-opam/2482/1

** Louis Roché announced


I started to write a few posts on how opam should be used in my opinion and what
to learn for someone comming from the javascript world. To support this effort,
I think that compilation cache (I’m not sure that the name is correct, please
tell me) is an important feature.

Some good work has already been done to tackle this issue. If you follow the
instructions on [[https://khady.info/opam-compilation-cache.html][this page]], you
should be able to experience instant switch creation or package installation.
But it seems that there are still problems with ocamlfind.

As my skills are limited, I hope to motivate contributions on this task by
providing a bounty. This is a 300 USD bounty. It can be found in this page:
https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1250468-local-cache-of-binary-packages

As a side note, I am thinking that we could have a topic gathering the different
existing bounties. I already created one to fix lwt ppx in the past. Ahrefs
creates bounties now and then. One central point could help for visibility.
