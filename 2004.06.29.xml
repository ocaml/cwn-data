    <cwn_title>ocamldap 1.5.0</cwn_title>
    <cwn_who>Eric Stokes announced</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
Hello all, its time for another release of Ocamldap. This release
includes a few bug fixes
in the high level code, and some pragmatic additions to various
components.

LDIF parser
- added methods to write as well as read LDIF
- added base64 encoding support (for read and write), the parser
should now be fully compliant with the LDIF standard
- added methods to read and write LDIF to and from strings

High level stuff
- dependancy generation (for generators) in ldapaccount has been fixed
so that it doesn&apos;t
pollute the object with strange objectclasses. It will not add
objectclasses in order to satisfy
generator dependancies anymore.
- added two new methods, service_exists, and services_present to
ldapaccount, which will allow
listing of the services on the account, and querying individual ones.
Most of this code was moved
in from rmwd.

Low level stuff
- added some very preliminary handling of referrals (don&apos;t raise an
exception when you hit one :P).
There is much work to do in this area. Currently openldap&apos;s C library
is transparently following referrals,
and there are a lot of cases where that isn&apos;t good at all. I would like
to add the ability for the library user
to control with great detail what is done with referrals.

as always, the Ocaml link database contains the authoritative link to
the code

    <cwn_what>
Is there any function in OCaml for copying a file
like with the Unix command &apos;cp&apos; ? I wish to avoid
using the function Sys.command to keep platform
independency.
I could not find any neither in the standard library,
nor in the Unix library.

    <cwn_who>Sylvain Le Gall answered as well</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
You can use the library i am developping : ocaml-fileutils.

It allows you to do &apos;cp&apos; and a lot of other operation ( &apos;mv&apos;, &apos;ls&apos;, &apos;find&apos;, &apos;rm&apos;... )

Moreover, you can do cp ~recurse:true to copy whole directory.

Least but not last, all the function should be platform independent,
regarding filename, because it use filePath which is a wrapper for
filename of the platform ( support : Unix, MacOs, Win32, Cygwin style ).

Actually, i am writing unitary test in order to release version 0.3,
which comes with operation on file size ( &apos;du&apos;, + test for find ), loop
prevention ( if you have a symlink from &apos;x&apos; to &apos;.&apos;, it won&apos;t recurse ).
It also changes some prototype : rm, cp will now use list as argument.

It also fixes some bugs. This new version will be available friday or
saturday.

Anyway, the current version should be enough for your usage ( and for
two days ).

    <cwn_title>Factor 5 speed increase for natively compiled camlp4 parsers</cwn_title>
    <cwn_who>Hendrik Tews said</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
Yesterday I managed to natively compile a custom camlp4
application. The speed increase was dramatic: from 10 seconds
down to 1.9 seconds for 1.4 MB of Ocaml code in 121 files. Below
I describe howto compile your camlp4 parser to native-code.
Further below there are some questions for the camlp4
maintainers.


HOW TO GET ``camlp4 pa_o.cmo pa_op.cmo foo.cmo&apos;&apos; DOWN TO NATIVE-CODE?

1. Prerequisites: 

   Some of the files you need are not installed in the standard
   ocaml distribution. Therefore you need a fully configured
   ocaml source tree. Say its located at ${ocamlsource}. Do a
   ``make world.opt&apos;&apos; there. (But don&apos;t clean!)

2. Compile the camlp4 extensible grammars for ocaml to native-code.

   cp ${ocamlsource}/camlp4/etc/pa_o.ml .
   ocamlopt -c -I `camlp4 -where` -pp &quot;camlp4r pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo&quot; \
	-o pa_o.cmx pa_o.ml
   cp ${ocamlsource}/camlp4/etc/pa_op.ml .
   ocamlopt -c -I `camlp4 -where` -pp &quot;camlp4r pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo&quot; \
	-o pa_op.cmx pa_op.ml

   You might want to copy the two cmx files to some ${lib}
   directory. If this differs from ``ocamlc -where&apos;&apos; you have to
   add ``-I ${lib}&apos;&apos; in step 4 below.

3. foo.cmx: Compile all the modules you want to load to camlp4 to
   native-code.

4. Do

   ocamlopt -linkall -I `camlp4 -where` \
      odyl.cmxa camlp4.cmxa \
      pa_o.cmx pa_op.cmx \
      pr_dump.cmx \
      foo.cmx \
      ${ocamlsource}/camlp4/odyl/odyl.cmx

   Note the -linkall! The second line is for the camlp4 runtime
   system. The third line is for standard ocaml syntax (with
   optimized parsers). The fourth line contains the standard
   printer (leave it out if you use your own printer). The fivth
   line is your camlp4 extension. The last line is for the main
   program.

   If you get wired errors about non-matching interfaces: Make
   sure your ocaml source tree is in sync with our ocaml
   installation!


4. Try it! I tried it on Otags, the TAGS generator from
   Jean-Francois Monin. Otags just uses camlp4 parsers and some
   customized printers (_not_ the usual camlp4 preprocessor to
   ocamlc approach). My biggest ocaml repository contains 51000
   lines of code in 121 files (1.4 MB). TAGS generation time
   drops from 10.4 seconds to 1.9 seconds. (I&apos;ll post an Otags
   patch in a separate email in the near future.)


WHAT IF YOU DON&apos;T NEED EXTENSIBLE GRAMMARS?

   Substitute ``${ocamlsource}/camlp4/compile/pa_o_fast.cmx&apos;&apos; for
   ``pa_o.cmx pa_op.cmx&apos;&apos; in line 3 in step 4 above. 

   Apparently there exists some way to compile camlp4 EXTEND
   expressions to plain stream parser source code. This is used
   during the ocaml build to generate pa_o_fast.ml from pa_o.ml
   and pa_op.ml. camlp4o.opt contains pa_o_fast.cmx.

   Applied to Otags this increases its speed by another factor 
   of 2. Now it takes mearly 1.2 second to generate the TAGS.
   This is almost 10 times faster than the original!


WHAT ABOUT THE REVISED SYNTAX?

   Leave out step two and substiture ``pa_r.cmx pa_rp.cmx&apos;&apos; in
   line 3 in step 4 above. 

   There is no pa_r_fast.ml. camlp4r.opt contains extensible
   grammars. 


QUESTIONS TO EXPERTS AND CAMLP4 MAINTAINERS:

1. Why is the -linkall neccessary? Its clear to me that one needs
   the -linkall when building camlp4o. However, I don&apos;t
   understand why camlp4o.opt needs the -linkall.

2. Is the process that generates pa_o_fast.ml applicable to all
   camlp4 grammars? Why is it not used for the revised syntax?
   What is the option -meta_action of pa_extend.cmo doing?

3. Would it be possible to include a ``mknativecamlp4&apos;&apos; script
   that automates the described procedure in the next
   distribution? 

   Would it be possible to build and install pa_o.cmx, pa_op.cmx,
   pa_o_fast.cmx, and odyl.cmx?

&gt; 1. Why is the -linkall neccessary? Its clear to me that one needs
&gt;    the -linkall when building camlp4o. However, I don&apos;t
&gt;    understand why camlp4o.opt needs the -linkall.

It is because of the programming style used in the modules to be
linked: some of them are not referenced (and therefore not linked in
without -linkall), but have useful actions in their initialisation
code, such as fill in an external reference with a function they&apos;ve
just defined. The -linkall option makes sure that all initialisation
codes are executed.

Now I agree with you that it looks strange. What I did (in the CVS)
is to use -linkall for building camlp4.cmxa: this way your recipe
works even without -linkall.

&gt; 2. Is the process that generates pa_o_fast.ml applicable to all
&gt;    camlp4 grammars?

No: it relies on the particular structure of files pa_o.ml and
pa_op.ml.

&gt;    Why is it not used for the revised syntax?

I suspect the revised syntax is meant to stay extensible, and this
extensibility would be lost if the parser was compiled `as much as&apos;
the one obtained in pa_o_fast. This is just a guess: I don&apos;t master all
Camlp4 secrets (yet) ;-)

&gt;    What is the option -meta_action of pa_extend.cmo doing?

It decides wether actions are to be interpreted as expressions or
meta-expressions (expressions at the meta-level). In short, it decides
wether &quot;2+3&quot; is parsed as the expression 2+3 or the expression
&lt;:expr&lt;2+3&gt;&gt;.

&gt; 3. Would it be possible to include a ``mknativecamlp4&apos;&apos; script
&gt;    that automates the described procedure in the next
&gt;    distribution?

I&apos;ll see what I can do, but note that this not a top priority right now.

&gt;    Would it be possible to build and install pa_o.cmx, pa_op.cmx,
&gt;    pa_o_fast.cmx, and odyl.cmx?

Done in the CVS.

&gt;
&gt; No, this cannot be the reason. You can never extend the natively
&gt; compiled version because you cannot load any modules.

Yes, you&apos;re right. Then, I don&apos;t know. It might be possible, if
pa_r.ml and pa_rp.ml have the right structure (to be processed in the
same way, producing a pa_r_fast.ml).

    <cwn_title>Why must types be always defined at the top level?</cwn_title>
    <cwn_who>John Hughes asked</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
As I revise my course notes from SML/NJ to OCaml, I find myself asking
some design questions --- &quot;Why did they do it THIS way?&quot;. I should
probably ask &quot;Why is this way the right way to do it, regardless of
the original motivation?,&quot; but let&apos;s assume the answers are the same.

1. Why no eqtypes? The idea of having the type-checker verify that you
weren&apos;t doing equality testing on non-equality-testable types seemed
like GOOD thing in SML, and I was surprised to see it gone.

2. Why no &quot;end&quot; on &quot;let&quot; expressions, i.e.,

 let a = 3 and b = 2 in a + b;;

rather than

 let a = 3 and b = 2 in a + b end; ?

3. Why semicolons for separating list items, so that

  [2,3] is interpreted as [(2,3)] ?

4. Why expose the hardware with float (and make it have equality
testing) rather than continue with &quot;real&quot; (which was not an eqtype, if
I recally correctly)?

------------

I&apos;m sure these were all good decisions, but I&apos;d like to better
understand them.

&gt; weren&apos;t doing equality testing on non-equality-testable types seemed
&gt; like GOOD thing in SML, and I was surprised to see it gone.

Eqtypes have been hotly debated even among the SML designers.  My
feeling is that it&apos;s not worthwhile to have a special, hard-wired
mechanism in the type checker just for the sake of equality.  There is
a general need to have polymorphic operations that are 1- not defined on
all instantiations of their types, and 2- can be defined differently
on different instantiations.  Haskell type classes are an example of a
*general* mechanism that addresses this need; GCaml&apos;s &quot;extentional
polymorphism&quot; is another.  But SML&apos;s eqtypes are just not general at all.

&gt; 2. Why no &quot;end&quot; on &quot;let&quot; expressions, i.e.,
&gt;
&gt;  let a = 3 and b = 2 in a + b;;
&gt;
&gt; rather than
&gt;
&gt;  let a = 3 and b = 2 in a + b end; ?

Ah, syntax...  Without entering in a debate on which syntax is &quot;better&quot;,
let me just give an historical reason: there was no &quot;end&quot; on &quot;let&quot;
expressions in the original LCF ML, from which Le_ML, then the first
Caml, then Caml Light, then OCaml derive.  We don&apos;t like gratuitous
syntax changes :-)

&gt; 3. Why semicolons for separating list items, so that
&gt;
&gt;   [2,3] is interpreted as [(2,3)] ?

Why not?  Again, I guess this is historical.  Both SML and the various
Camls use two symbols &quot;,&quot; and &quot;;&quot; to denote three different things
(tuples, lists and arrays, and sequence).  SML &quot;overloads&quot; the comma
to mean two of these things, Caml overloads the semicolon.

&gt; 4. Why expose the hardware with float (and make it have equality
&gt; testing) rather than continue with &quot;real&quot; (which was not an eqtype, if
&gt; I recally correctly)?

Unless a language offers exact-precision arithmetic on computable
reals, I strongly object to the use of the word &quot;real&quot; to refer to
what&apos;s merely floating-point numbers.  Floats aren&apos;t reals by any
stretch of the imagination, and the earlier the programmer realizes
this, the better.

As to whether equality should be defined on floats, there are pros and
cons.  My standpoint is that it&apos;s eventually better to stick to
established standards (that is, IEEE float arithmetic) rather than try
to reinvent a wheel likely to be even squarer than these standards.
Prof. Kahan found it worthwhile to fully define equality over floats;
I&apos;ll abide by his wisdom.
    </cwn_what>
    <cwn_who>John Hughes asked another question</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
I have one more question, though:

5. Why can I no longer type-annotate things I&apos;ve written, so that

let f x y z = (x = y) &amp; (y = z)

defines a function applicable to ALL types? I actually *liked*
being able to say something like

let f x y z:int = (x = y) &amp;&amp; (y = z)

so that it would be restricted to ints. (It frequently helped me to
untangle cryptic error messages that ML produced, AND to document
my intent as I wrote code). I can still
trick it into doing that, by something like

let f = function
  | (x,y,z) -&gt; (x==y) &amp;&amp; (y == z)
  | (a,b,_) -&gt; (a-b) = 0;;

which will turn out to never invoke the second case, but still
restrict the
type. But surely this is not more readable/maintainable code...(Yes, I
know
it has a slightly different signature, but I didn&apos;t have the heart to
work around that just now).

Thanks again for the informative answers.

David Brown:
      
You can, you just need parens:

  # let f x y (z:int) = (x = y) &amp;&amp; (y = z)
  val f : int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;

Olivier Andrieu:

Actually, it&apos;s annotating the return value of f (ie the right hand
side of the =). To annotate f, you have to use this syntax :

# let f x y z : bool = (x = y) &amp; (y = z) ;;
val f : &apos;a -&gt; &apos;a -&gt; &apos;a -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# let f : int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; bool = fun x y z -&gt; (x = y) &amp; (y = z) ;;
val f : int -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;

    <cwn_title>Thread and kernel 2.6 pb still there in CVS</cwn_title>
    <cwn_who>Christophe Raffalli asked and Xavier Leroy answered</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
&gt; In the latest CVS of ocaml there is still the periodic call Thread.yield
&gt; (through a sigalarm) in thread_posix.ml

Yes, and that is necessary to get preemptive scheduling.  Without this
periodic Thread.yield, a thread that performs no I/O and no
inter-thread communications would prevent all other Caml threads from
running at all.

&gt; This implies that a threaded OCaml program ON A LINUX KERNEL 2.6 (at
&gt; least 2.6.3 on Mandrake 10, but probaby all 2.6) gets very little CPU
&gt; when another process is running (the usual figure is 10% CPU for the
&gt; threaded OCaml program against 90% for another program)

Thread.yield does three things:
   - release the global Caml mutex, giving other Caml threads a chance
     to grab it and run;
   - call sched_yield() to suggest the kernel scheduler that now is
     a good time to schedule another thread;
   - re-acquire the global Caml mutex before returning to the caller.

The 2.6 Linux kernels changed the behavior of sched_yield() in a way
that causes the unfairness you observed.  Other threaded applications
are affected, including Open Office (!).  My belief is that it&apos;s
really a bug in 2.6 kernels and that the new behavior of sched_yield(),
while technically conformant to the POSIX specs, lowers the quality of
implementation quite a lot.

(I seem to remember from my LinuxThreads development days that this
isn&apos;t the first time the kernel developers broke sched_yield(), then
realized their error.)

The question I&apos;m currently investigating is whether the call to
sched_yield() can be omitted, as it&apos;s just a scheduling hint.  Initial
experiments suggested that this would hurt fairness (in Caml thread
scheduling) quite a lot on all platforms other than Linux 2.6.
More careful experiments that I&apos;m currently conducting suggest that it
might not be so bad.  One can also play games where sched_yield()
isn&apos;t called if there are no other Caml threads waiting for the global
Caml mutex.

In summary, a solution will eventually be found, but please be
patient, and submit a bug report next time.

On Monday, June 14 we had a meeting of the (first ever?) Seattle OCaml
Special Interest Group. It was 3 people, the beer was good, and the
discussion was lively. I now want to broaden the mission statement to
include all ML&apos;ers. I think we might get a few more people that way.

We agreed that The Stumbling Monk, a Belgian pub in Capitol Hill, was
a good venue for beer. We also thought that meetings at roughly 3 week
intervals is the right pace. Yes that&apos;s a funny number to remember,
but 2 weeks is too quick and once a month is too slow. So we
think. Anyways, I would like to organize the next meeting for the week
of july 5th, at The Monk again. Day and time to be decided.

    <cwn_who>Jon Harrop asked</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
I'm trying to convert an interpreter written in OCaml into a JIT compiler.
Generating OCaml code from host code seems to be the best way to do this as
the generated code can then use the interpreter's data structures and
functions.

However, I'm currently creating temporary source files, calling ocamlopt and
using marshalling to another temporary file in order to get the data back and
forth.

Is there a better way of doing this?

So your interpreter might generate Ocaml bytecode (perhaps reusing the
&quot;lambda&quot; representation of Ocamlc) - and ocamljitrun will, when
interpreting it, translate the bytecode to machine code.

Ocamljitrun requires latest Ocaml CVS or future Ocaml 3.08. (the
current 3.07 release won&apos;t work with it).

Feel free to ask me additional questions about it.

your JIT.

You might generate &quot;lambda&quot; representation (see
ocaml/bytecomp/lambda.mli) of the compiler, or at least typed trees
(see ocaml/typedtree.mli).

You might use MetaOcaml see http://metaocaml.org/

&gt; If ocamljitrun is based upon a GNU library then it must be GPL, is
&gt; that right?

Ocamljitrun &amp; GNU lightning - the library used by Ocamljitrun - are
under LGPL = GNU *lesser* general public license. Also, ocamljitrun is
slower (on running your Ocaml source code) than code compiled with
ocamlopt, but faster than bytecode interpreted by
ocamlrun. Ocamljitrun has the usual LGPL exception common in Ocaml
INRIA code. (I don&apos;t know if it apply to the GNU lightning itself).

Because of a bug in GNU lightning, ocamljitrun currently crashes on
PowerPC.

I am definitely not a lawyer (and the constitution, laws and contracts
I am under - french law and INRIA temporary work contract - are
probably not the laws and contracts which govern you - probably US
laws) - but as far as I know ocamjitrun is under GNU LGPL - ie Lesser
GPL licence, like GNU lightning which it is using.

However, the usual meta-advice is that for legal advice, you should
ask professional lawyers. Never take any word I am telling on legal
stuff seriously - I AM NOT A LAWYER!

&gt; &gt; You did not explain why are you writing a JIT (speed issues?)
&gt;
&gt; Yes, purely for speed.

J-M.Eber also have similar concerns (he is writing a commercial
product in and with Ocaml). I think that his company (Lexifi) is
member of the Ocaml consortium.... His concern is to accelerate a
function doing many floating point operations and a few Ocaml function
application. The function is dynamically generated at runtime by his
complex product. I suggested him to generate C code (calling the
appropriate OCaml caml_callback* when needed to apply functions) and
then compile it (by forking a gcc command) as a shared library, and
then dlopen it and using dlsym to get the function pointer and at last
call it. You&apos;ll have to dlclose the library after using it. In
principle, it is like using the Dynlink module, but ugly details
differ.

&gt; &gt; and what is the target language (x86 machine code, assembler, C,
&gt; &gt; Ocaml?) of your JIT.
&gt;
&gt; Anything which can be efficiently compiled into x86 and PPC machine
&gt; code using tools which are free for commercial use. Currently, I&apos;m
&gt; outputting OCaml and using ocamlopt which produces great code but
&gt; isn&apos;t free (enough) and can&apos;t dynamically link the JIT compiled code
&gt; back in. I should probably investigate more efficient ways to
&gt; marshal data between two programs.

I believe that existing marshalling routines are quite fast. I&apos;m not
sure you&apos;ll easily recode equivalent functionality (in particular
polymorphism) running much faster.

&gt; I think that the bits which I want to compile are quite simple -
&gt; just functions to do tree manipulations which I want to partially
&gt; specialise over the manipulations which they perform.

&gt; &gt; You might generate &quot;lambda&quot; representation (see
&gt; &gt; ocaml/bytecomp/lambda.mli) of the compiler, or at least typed trees
&gt; &gt; (see ocaml/typedtree.mli).
&gt;
&gt; I&apos;ll check these out, thank you.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You might use MetaOcaml see http://metaocaml.org/
&gt;
&gt; AFAIK there still isn&apos;t a native-code version.

I suppose that next version of MetaOcaml should be compatible with
Ocamljitrun (because it is compatible with next release of Ocaml).

&gt; &gt; You might generate C-- code: see http://cminusminus.org/

&gt; This seems to be my best bet so far. How easy would be it to retarget
&gt; ocamljitrun to use C-- (it&apos;s totally free)?

It is not worth doing it (and it should be boring). My suggestion was
to generate C-- code independently of ocamljitrun. But details are
probably clever. Regarding licensing issues of C--, go the C-- web
page or mailing list.

&gt; &gt; So your interpreter might generate Ocaml bytecode (perhaps reusing
&gt; &gt; the &quot;lambda&quot; representation of Ocamlc) - and ocamljitrun will, when
&gt; &gt; interpreting it, translate the bytecode to machine code.

&gt; The two main problems with that are the speed hit that my
&gt; interpreter would take (because it could no longer be from ocamlopt)
&gt; and, I assume, the GPL on GNU lightning.

You should be aware that GNU lightning is LGPL not GPL and that there
are big licensing differences between both. Also, ocamljitrun is a
standalone executable - which you can run in many ways, much like you
can use GNU emacs (which is under GPL, not LGPL) to edit whatever
material you want.

Ask your lawyer about LGPL licensing issues - from my &quot;academic&quot; point
of view, I see none. but I am not a lawyer!

Also note that ocamljitrun is a binary which is a plugin replacement
for ocamlrun, this means that (as far as I understand your needs) you
don&apos;t need to link it with your program. This means that the
hypothetical linking issues of the LGPL is not a concern. In my
non-lawyer opinion, ocamljitrun is like ocamlrun so can run any
program you like, including commercial ones.

But I tend to believe that asking a lawyer or a legal expert is the
best solution to legal problems. Before going to your lawyer, read
careful the many materials on GPL &amp; LGPL available on the Web.

&gt; I suggested him to generate C code (calling the
&gt; appropriate OCaml caml_callback* when needed to apply functions) and
&gt; then compile it (by forking a gcc command) as a shared library, and
&gt; then dlopen it and using dlsym to get the function pointer and at last
&gt; call it. You&apos;ll have to dlclose the library after using it. In
&gt; principle, it is like using the Dynlink module, but ugly details
&gt; differ.

If I remember well, Christophe Raffalli adopts a similar technique in
his program GlSurf. You may want to have a look to his (LGPL&apos;d) code
[1].

My feeling is that custom linking is nearly obsolete - better use dll
libraries which are well supported in ocaml now.

&gt; Sorry for changing the subject, but can ocamljitrun be used with
&gt; &quot;ocamlc -custom&quot;? I have a program which uses some small C modules,
&gt; and I couldn&apos;t find an obvious way to make it compile or run using
&gt; ocamljitrun. AFAIK, -custom links the bytecode interpreter with the
&gt; binary as part of its magic.

It is doable by linking the libcamljitrun.a instead of
libcamlrun.a. Since -lcamlrun is a builtin library name (in ocamlc
-custom), the trick (suggested by Xavier Leroy) is to copy
libcamljitrun.a into a unique directory like
/usr/local/lib/ocamljitdir/ and pass -cclib
-L/usr/local/lib/ocamljitdir/ to your ocamlc command.

&gt; On topic, does that affect licencing? It doesn&apos;t really matter to me,
&gt; but it might for some people I guess...

Ocamljitrun is under LGPL as is GNU lightning. I believe that the
special exception applying to Ocaml like software like ocamljitrun do
not apply to the GNU lightning library, which is LGPL, but as I said
many times, I AM NOT A LAWYER.

the Ocamljit library should be buildable as a shared library - just
edit the GNUUmakefile of ocamljit appropriately to add -fPIC to the
compilation command, and build a shared library instead of a static
one. As usual on x86 there is a small penalty (because of register
shortage for global offset table access) in shared libraries.
