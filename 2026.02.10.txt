intel_hex.0.3
═════════════

  Hi there!

  I am excited to announce the release of the [intel_hex] library. This
  library is a manipulation library that provides functions for reading,
  writing, and creating Intel HEX data, which is a common format used in
  embedded system programming.


  ┌────
  │ Intel_hex.Record.
  │   [
  │       Extended_segment_address 0x0F;
  │       Data (0x0000, "Hello ");
  │       Data (0x0007, "World!");
  │       End_of_file;
  │   ]
  │ |> Intel_hex.records_to_string 
  │ |> print_endline
  └────

  ┌────
  │ :02000002000FED
  │ :0600000048656C6C6F20E6
  │ :06000700576F726C6421CA
  │ :00000001FF
  └────

  Also, you can of course read the IHEX object file from other sources:
  ┌────
  │ In_channel.with_open_text "data.hex" Intel_hex.object_of_channel
  └────

  ┌────
  │ - : Intel_hex.Object.t = 
  │ { 
  │   start_linear_address = 0;
  │   start_segment_address = {cs = 0; ip = 0};
  │   chunks = [(240, "Hello "); (247, "World!")]
  │ }
  └────

  Limitations

  32-bitness. To represent 32-bit integers, the library uses the OCaml
  int data type. This may be problematic for 32-bit systems, as it can
  lead to overflow errors, but it works fine for most 64-bit systems.

  Start addressing and extending addressing. Not fully supported for
  real-world use. I would appreciate your pull request on this!

  Hello all! Been working on [layoutz], a tiny, zero-dep combinator lib
  for making pretty, structured, terminal output: tables, trees, boxes,
  ANSI styled elements, etc.

  Would love to hear how the API feels: Smooth? Any missing primitives
  you'd expect? Many thanks!

  I have introduced a printing bug in the Rocq back-end, reported by
  Xavier Leroy. I am releasing version 20260203 today to fix this bug.

Talks
╌╌╌╌╌

◊ Compile-time Computation for Caml

  /by Jeremy Yallop/

  (Abstract TBD)


◊ Dynamic Verification of OCaml Software with ORTAC/QCheck-STM

  /by Nikolaus Huber/

        In this talk I would like to introduce the QCheck-STM
        plugin for ORTAC, a framework for dynamic verification of
        OCaml code. ORTAC/QCheck-STM consumes OCaml module
        signatures annotated with contracts expressed in the
        Gospel language and generates code for automated runtime
        assertion checking from it. I will highlight some details
        of the implementation of the tool, the structure of the
        generated code, and on errors found in established OCaml
        libraries.

  —

  We are very much looking forward to meeting the OCaml community in
  London!

  Cheers, Alistair & Sacha
