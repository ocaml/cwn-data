since you mention my logs-syslog package here, let me answer you . ;)

- Lwt_logs now moved to a separate repository (see
<a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/468">https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/468</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/pull/484">https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/pull/484</a>). NB: I never used Lwt_logs and can't
answer your initial question about syslog support.
- logs-syslog "depends on lot of external libraries": my perception is
different, it requires `ocamlfind`, `ocamlbuild`, and `topkg` for building, plus
`logs`, `ptime`, and `syslog-message` (which itself depends additionally on
`astring`) at runtime.
The [logs library](<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/logs/doc/Logs.html#basics">http://erratique.ch/software/logs/doc/Logs.html#basics</a>) is
very convenient to use IMHO, and has builtin support for both terminal, but also
browser console (when cross-compiling to JS). I wrote logs-syslog to solve the
exact problem - exfiltrating log messages via syslog - once logs was adopted
more widely (at least by the MirageOS community, see
<a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release#Logs-Where-You-Want-Them">https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release#Logs-Where-You-Want-Them</a>).
Others (at Docker) wrote reporters for both [Apply system
log](<a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-asl">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-asl</a>) and [Windows event
log](<a href="https://github.com/djs55/ocaml-win-eventlog">https://github.com/djs55/ocaml-win-eventlog</a>).
The syslog-message library does not yet support structured syslog ([RFC
5424](<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424</a>)), apart from that the logs-syslog
library supports three transports, UDP, TCP, TLS (including client
authentication) - and 3 backends: Unix (OCaml stdlib), Lwt, MirageOS. Please let
me know if you have a specific use case not covered by logs-syslog. Further
reading about the MirageOS syslog integration is available at

I have the pleasure to announce that
[sequence](<a href="https://github.com/c-cube/sequence">https://github.com/c-cube/sequence</a>) has reached its version 1.0.
Sequence is a lightweight, high-performance library of iterators that is
compatible with existing `iter` functions. Sequence 1.0 is a breaking release
that comes with some simplification of the API and a bump of the minimum
supported OCaml version to 4.02 that comes from jbuilder.

about](<a href="https://github.com/c-cube/sequence#short-tutorial">https://github.com/c-cube/sequence#short-tutorial</a>)

      </pre><i>Hezekiah Carty then asked:</i><br /><pre>
This is great, thank you!

Is there a writeup somewhere on how to pick between sequence and
[gen](<a href="https://github.com/c-cube/gen">https://github.com/c-cube/gen</a>)? Both seem similar in intent. Is one
generally a better choice than the other?
      </pre><i>Simon Cruanes replied:</i><br /><pre>
I just wrote a basic explanation here:

. I'll try to expand it if it's not clear enough.

The release of OCaml version 4.06.1 is imminent.  We have
created a release candidate for your testing pleasure.  Please
try it and let me know whether it works for you.

We want to know about any show-stopping bugs, especially in the
compilation and installation phases.

This release candidate is available as an opam switch:
  opam switch 4.06.1+rc1

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.

I have  the pleasure  to announce that containers 2.0+alpha1 is being released.

[containers](<a href="https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers">https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers</a>) is a modular,
ightweight, and performant extension of the standard library. Version 2.0
introduces a monomorphic mode (thanks to @jpdeplaix) that is designed to prevent
errors caused by the polymorphic "magic" operators such as `(=)`. This breaking
release is also the occasion to switch to dune, and to fix some inconsistencies
in the API (mostly printers).

If you use containers, please give a try to 2.0+alpha1 and report any issue on
the bucktracker!
