We're very similar, except that we now do use a monadic syntax pretty
pervasively. I wrote about this here:

<https://blogs.janestreet.com/let-syntax-and-why-you-should-use-it/>

and am if anything more convinced that it's a worthwhile idiom. Monads and
Applicatives are useful in so many places (beyond Async and Lwt) that having
syntactic support for them is really nice, especially for the let .. and
constructs.

As co-author of the now-obsolete pa_monad, I emphatically agree!

2) aws-s3 0.9.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Anders Peter Fugmann announced:

It is my pleasure to announce aws-s3 0.9.0

aws-s3 implements operations to manipulate objects in Amazons Simple Storage
Service (S3). Operations include: get, put, delete, delete_multi and ls. The
library also includes functions to get machine role and security token
(credentials) through AWS Identity and Access Management service (IAM).

The library uses async for concurrency.

aws-s3 is available though opam and from github[1]
