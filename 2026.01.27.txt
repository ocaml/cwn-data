lwt-to-eio: Automating the mechanical parts of Lwt -> Eio migration

oug-t announced
───────────────

  Hi everyone,

  Like many of you, I’ve been looking into migrating my libraries from
  Lwt to Eio to take advantage of OCaml 5’s direct-style
  concurrency. While the manual migration guides are excellent, I found
  myself making the same mechanical changes over and over—flattening
  binds, unwrapping promises, and rewriting maps.

  So, I built *`lwt-to-eio'*, a tool that automates the boring parts of
  this transition.

  *Repo:* [https://github.com/oug-t/lwt-to-eio]


[https://github.com/oug-t/lwt-to-eio]
<https://github.com/oug-t/lwt-to-eio>

What it does (The Magic)
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  It parses your OCaml source code and performs AST-level rewrites to
  transform monadic Lwt patterns into direct-style Eio code.

  *Input (Lwt):*

  ┌────
  │ let fetch_data id =
  │   Lwt.bind (Db.get_user id) (fun user ->
  │     Db.get_posts user.id >>= (fun posts ->
  │       Lwt_list.map_p process posts
  │     )
  │   )
  └────

  *Output (Eio)*

  ┌────
  │ let fetch_data id =
  │   let user = Lwt_eio.Promise.await_lwt (Db.get_user id) in
  │   let posts = Lwt_eio.Promise.await_lwt (Db.get_posts user.id) in
  │   Eio.Fiber.List.map process posts
  └────


Current Status & Help Wanted
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This is currently an *MVP*. It handles the most common patterns I
  encountered (binds, `map_p', `sleep', `return'), but there is plenty
  of surface area left to cover.

  I'm looking for contributors to help add rules for other common
  patterns. I've tagged a few issues as *"Good First Issues"* if anyone
  wants to dip their toes into `ppxlib' and AST rewriting:

  • *`Lwt.catch' -> `try/with'*: Transforming monadic error handling to
     direct style exceptions.
  • *`Lwt_io' support*: Mapping legacy IO functions to Eio buffers.

  Feedback, PRs, and "It broke on my file!" reports are all very
  welcome.

  Happy hacking!

  I am very pleased to announce that [Dream], the Web framework, is now
  owned and maintained by a new team, of:

  • Sabine Schmaltz (@sabine), maintainer of OCaml.org
  • Sebastian Willenbrink ( <https://github.com/Willenbrink> ), author
    of the effort to port Dream to Eio
  • Yawar Amin (@yawaramin), author of dream-html, and the Web framework
    ReWeb

  …among their other projects and contributions to the OCaml
  community. All are major and long-term contributors to, and users of,
  Dream.

  I’ve stepped back from ownership and overall maintenance, but will
  still work on parts of Dream every now and then as a contributor,
  along with all of Dream’s contributors :slight_smile:

  Dream is discussed in this forum, in its [issue tracker], [#webdev] in
  the OCaml Discord, and [#dream] on Zulip. Dream has a (roughly) weekly
  open video call on Discord for contributors to discuss technical
  issues with each other and with maintainers.

  Welcome to Sabine, Sebastian, Yawar, the new team!

  Hello!

  It is in a state of sliplessness that I announce the new release of
  Slipshow!

  *Slipshow 0.8.0: Les gnomes voleurs de Slipshow*

  This release comes with a handful of bugfixes, in particular on the
  new and experimental record-and-replay for drawings.

  But the star of the release is *the new [documentation]*! For
  instance, the tutorial on [structuring your presentation visually]
  will allow you to create presentations such as this one, presenting
  Slipshow's business model:

  <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41539c78-f998-4597-9392-4d555435d5a3>

  The tutorials also includes live code blocks, and Slipshow has now a
  [dedicated website].

  Here is the full changelog!

Bancos: A persistent Key-Value store based on ROWEX/P-ART
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-bancos-a-persistent-key-value-store-based-on-rowex-p-art/17719/1>


Calascibetta Romain announced
─────────────────────────────

  I am pleased to announce the first release of [bancos], our new
  persistent Key-Value store.

  Bancos is an implementation of an Adaptive Radix Tree ([ART]) modified
  to support parallel reads and writes ([ROWEX]) directly on a file
  (based on the [RECIPE/P-ART] approach).

  • Our project is designed for indexing with file-backed storage.
  • We provide an implementation compatible with unikernels. It is
    currently being used by [kevin], an HTTP/1.1 server unikernel that
    exposes routes for key insertion and lookup.
  • This work is part of our broader goal to index emails by their
    `Message-ID'. An extension of our tool [blaze] now allows searching
    through archives now (if you are interesting about our archive
    system, you can take a look [here]). This indexing also enables
    efficient email thread extraction using `In-Reply-To' headers.

  While still experimental, the results — especially when paired with
  our [Miou] scheduler — are very promising. This release of [bancos]
  comes alongside several updates across our stack:
  • [flux]: Our OCaml stream library for Miou
  • [carton]: For manipulating PACKv2 archives (as used by Git)
  • [bstr]: A library for handling bigbytes and memory buffers
  • [cachet]: A library to cache `mmap' syscall results. Notably, this
    include significant work on an _asynchronous write pipeline_ for
    unikernels on block devices

  You can find the project here: <https://github.com/robur-coop/bancos>

  For a deeper dive into the implementation of bancos and its
  application to email indexing, we have prepared a detailed blog post
  [here].

  Happy hacking!

  Hello,

  I am happy to announce a new version of [restricted].

  This library lets you limit which system operations and which parts of
  the filesystem your program can access. Call it as early as possible
  in your program so that the rest of the code runs with reduced
  privileges. Currently, actual enforced restrictions are implemented
  for these operating systems:

  • OpenBSD
  • Linux (only filesystem view)

  Even on other operating systems, you can still use [restricted] to
  document which privileges your program needs. Users can then test if
  your program respects these promises with tools such as [pledge on
  Linux]. Enjoy :slight_smile:

  • [opam]
  • [api]
  • [examples]
  • [git repo]
  • [License AGPL]

  CHANGELOG:

  • add Linux (only filesystem view) via landlock(7)
    • except unlink/removing, whole other thing with
      LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE in landlock
  • add [Semantic Versioning]
  • change description to make it more clear
  • tested with flambda switch on:
    • x86_64-openbsd
    • x86_64-arch-linux, x86_64-alpine-linux (Landlock ABI version: 7)

  Hello everyone,

  I am happy to announce [the release of the dead_code_analyzer 1.1.0]
  (available via `opam') !

  Thanks to @edwinans, @nojb, and @Tibo for their contributions,
  reviews, and feedback.

  This release greatly improves the support of projects built with
  `dune' and introduces some [user documentation].  The tool still
  requires **OCaml 5.2**. There is a [work in progress to support OCaml
  5.3].

  If you encounter a problem with this release, please [report it on the
  github repository].  Feedback and contributions are welcome.

Proposal: make the minimum tested opam 2.1 and higher
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/proposal-make-the-minimum-tested-opam-2-1-and-higher/17736/1>


Anil Madhavapeddy announced
───────────────────────────

  Much as we did a while back with [raising the minimum version of OCaml
  tested to 4.08], it's now time to raise the minimum version of opam
  that we test in the CI matrix.

  [opam 2.0.0 was released] in 2018, and ever since then the Docker
  images have [built every version], with the default being the minimum
  version (2.0.x) all the way through to 2.5.x.

  I now propose that we raise the minimum tested version of opam to
  2.1.x. Looking in [repology/opam], the only notable distro still
  shipping opam 2.0 is Ubuntu 20.04, which went EOL in May 2025.  Ubuntu
  24.04 still has have 2.1.x, so I expect this will be the testing floor
  for some years until that rotates out.

  The most observable improvement from this will be the opam-repository
  CI 'The actions to process have cyclic dependencies' failure will no
  longer bug us for every package submitted that has `{with-test}'
  clauses!

Josh Berdine announced
──────────────────────

  The csexp-query 0.1.0 [opam package] is now available.

  If you have ever wanted to query e.g. the output of `dune describe'
  (but didn't want the dependency cone of [sexp]), then [csexp-query]
  might be interesting.

  `csexp-query' is a minimal command-line tool to query [canonical
  s-expressions] (csexp) from stdin. For example,
  ┌────
  │ dune describe workspace --format=csexp | csexp-query '(field root)'
  └────
  will extract the dune project root.

  Happy hacking!
