What wasn't mentioned in this announcement was the existance of a 
mailing list. I posted to the mailing list: 

    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=cothreads-discuss">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=cothreads-discuss</a>

but I suspect that I may be the only person on the list :-).

&gt; this looks like something I'd be very happy to use. Have you tried compiling 
&gt; lablgtk2 with it ? 

&gt; (so that I could get rid of the following:) 
&gt; [ 
&gt; The files /usr/lib/ocaml/3.10.0/process/thread.cmi 
&gt; and /usr/lib/ocaml/3.10.0/lablgtk2/gtkThread.cmi 
&gt; make inconsistent assumptions over interface Thread 
&gt; ] 


I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but the reason of error seems obvious: 
lablgtk2 seems to have been compiled with the Thread module of system threads 
or VM thread (both come with OCaml's standard distribution), while you're 
linking them with other modules compiled against the Thread module of process 
engine. 

The Thread module interfaces from the three engines differ with each 
other! Note that this is not the problem from coThreads, it's a problem of 
standard Threads library: 

 - The Thread interfaces of system threads and VM threads coming with the 
   standard distribution *already* differ with each other, so that the objects 
   compiled with system Thread won't be able to mix with objects compiled with 
   VM thread, vice versa. (The problem is the same as in your case) 

 - We have no way to unify the three of them without modifying the files from 
   original distribution, which is exactly what we manage to avoid. 

On the other hand, the Cothread module (a super set of the Thread interface) is 
provided to achieve object-level compatibility, so that the objects compiled 
with different engines can mix. All other modules from Threads and coThreads, 
e.g. Mutex, Event, don't have this problem. 

You'd like to read the compatibility page for more explanation: 
<a href="http://cothreads.sourceforge.net/doc/compatibility">http://cothreads.sourceforge.net/doc/compatibility</a>

First note that the naming convention follows the standard threads library in 
OCaml: Threads and coThreads (both with 's') refer to the library (*.cm(x)a); 
Thread and Cothread (neither with 's') are modules (*.cm[ox]) inside. 

&gt; &gt; The Thread module interfaces from the three engines differ with each 
&gt; &gt; other! Note that this is not the problem from coThreads, it's a problem of 
&gt; &gt; standard Threads library: 

&gt; Why don't you just use a different module name? 


The different module name *is* Cothread, a compatible super set of Thread 
module. Use this module instead if you want to have object-level 
compatibility. In short, all the three engines have the two libraries with 
isomorphic structures (quite simple) : 

&lt;code&gt; 
  threads.cm(x)a = threads.cm[ox], mutex.cm[ox], condition.cm[ox], event.cm[ox] 
cothreads.cm(x)a = threads.cm[ox], mutex.cm[ox], condition.cm[ox], event.cm[ox], cothread.cm[ox], stm.cm[ox] 
&lt;/code&gt; 

See, we also provide the compatible "threads.cm(x)a" for the process 
engine. Think about the following scenario: 

 - If you're working on legacy code, you don't care STM and don't care 
   object-level compatibility, the only thing you're interested is to running 
   your code with process to speedup, then the only thing to change in your 
   Makefile is the include path e.g. "-I +threads" -&gt; "-I +process", you can 
   still using Thread module and "threads.cma", they are present in process 
   engine. 

 - You have several projects, some of them using traditional Threads, some 
   using coThreads, you don't want to bother to remember that. So simply 
   changing all linking library from threads.cma to cothreads.cma is fine, 
   because coThreads library contains every modules in Threads library. 

 - You have some legacy code written in standard Threads, and you'd like to 
   have it run with processes. Though you don't care about the newly introduced 
   modules of coThreads, you do want to have a single copy of object files for 
   each engines. In such case, you need to add one line to any source code 
   which makes use of the Thread module: 

   module Thread = Cothread 

   because Thread module (the only module in Threads and coThreads) don't have 
   object-level compatibility, and change any occurrence of “threads.cm(x)a” to 
   “cothreads.cm(x)a” in your Makefile.

Here is a little patch to get access to stack traces inside a running 
program, for use with long-running servers. It is like Markus Mottl's 
patch but uses the standard backtrace mechanism. It works with both 
bytecode and native code. 

Patch and instructions here:

  We are considering to remove ocamldbi [1] from Debian for various 
reasons (upstream development idle for some time, not yet ported to 
sqlite3, popcon score quite low). Before doing so however we are trying 
to figure out how many users are still using it by other means than 
popcon. 

So, here it goes, if someone here is actively using ocamldbi 
(preferably on Debian but not strictly necessary) can she please send me 
a private mail stating so?  Even mails stating thinks like «I was using 
it but I stopped doing so for this and that ...» would help. 

Many thanks in advance, 
Cheers.

This is to announce the release of the OCaml Network Application   
Environment (OCaml NAE) Core Foundation library version 0.9 (cf-0.9). 

Download the source and ocamldoc output from the project page on   
SourceForge: 

        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocnae">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocnae</a> 

This is a maintenance release to fix bugs and improve compatibility   
with OCaml-3.10.0. 

===== OCaml NAE Core Foundation (cf) library ===== 

This distribution is the Objective Caml Network Application   
Environment (NAE) 
Core Foundation library, which is a collection of miscellaneous   
extensions to 
the Objective Caml standard library. 

Highlighted features include: 

- Functional streams and stream processors (extended). 
- Functional bootstrapped skew-binomial heap. 
- Functional red-black binary tree (associative array). 
- Functional sets based on red-black binary tree. 
- Functional real-time catenable deque. 
- Functional LL(x) parsing using state-exception monad. 
- Functional lazy deterministic finite automaton (DFA). 
- Functional lexical analyzer (using lazy DFA and monadic parser). 
- Functional substring list manipulation (message buffer chains). 
- Gregorian calendar date manipulation. 
- Standard time manipulation. 
- System time in Temps Atomique International (TAI). 
- Unicode transcoding. 
- Universal resource identifier (URI) manipulation. 

Additionally, the following noteworthy features are provided for   
compatibility 
with earlier versions of this library.  Further developments to these   
features 
are expected to move to a new, separate [Nx] library.  These features   
are not 
expected to improve in the [Cf] library for the version 0.x series,   
and they 
will be removed in the 1.x series. 

- Extended socket interface (supports more options, and UDP w/ 
multicast). 
- I/O event multiplexing (with Unix.select). 

Note: see the ISSUES file for a list of open problems in this release. 

===== Version 0.9 ===== 

Highlights of the changes: 

+ Compatibility with OCaml-3.10+beta. 
+ Fix bug in Cf_rbtree.nearest_(incr|decr) functions. 
+ Minor performance improvement. 
+ Minor bugs in tests fixed. 
+ Noted that socket extensions and event multiplexing are moving to the 
   forthcoming Nx library. 

===== Required Components ===== 

This library requires the following external components: 

- Objective Caml (v3.10.0 or newer) 
- Findlib (tested with v1.1.2p1) 

Principal development was on Mac OS X 10.4 w/ XCode 2.4.1 using GCC   
4.0.  Other 
platforms with POSIX-like environments should require a minimal   
porting effort. 

One major open issue: the extended socket interface is broken under   
WIN32. 

(The author invites help porting the library to other environments.)

A new vim plugin to handle annot files is available at: 

<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2025">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2025</a> 

Differences with previous plugins: 
- ocamlbuild is handled (even if you change the '_build' to another   
name, but cross fingers in this case) 
- no more need for python support, only vim inside 
- little bonus : handling of latin1 accents, of parenthesized   
expressions, lists, arrays (no need for visual mode) 

see details on the page.

&gt; I would like to know if there are references on the OCaml VM other   
&gt; than 
&gt; the source code of bytecomp/byterun, I found none on the OCaml   
&gt; website. 
&gt; My aim would be to write a small compiler that would target the OCaml 
&gt; runtime systems. 


While developping OCaml-Java, I had to reverse-engineer this   
information. 
I produced two pdf files available at <a href="http://cadmium.x9c.fr/">http://cadmium.x9c.fr/</a> 
downloads.html : 
        - caml-formats.pdf describes both the marshalled data format and the   
bytecode file format; 
        - caml-instructions.pdf describes all the instructions used by the   
OCaml VM. 

Hope this helps, 

Xavier
