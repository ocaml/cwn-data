And yet another way is to use perl4caml[1] and WWW::Mechanize[2] which
is wrapped by perl4caml.  This allows you to fairly easily navigate
websites (click links, push buttons, fill in forms and so on).

&gt; First of all, what is going on in the Event module?  I can't exactly get
&gt; it to work an I fear I'm missing some important concept.  I can't find
&gt; any documentation other than the interface.  Does anybody know of any
&gt; further documeeentation or have a good explanation of exactly what's
&gt; going on.

Yes, the Event module is quite confusing.  I have used it in this code
(in the file adwords_mt.ml) to implement a simple command pipe between
a parent thread and worker threads, so you might want to download and
take a look at this code:

&gt; I've got to different types of objects, say database tables and
&gt; cursors for one table.  Caml code is expected to access these objects
&gt; using some handle reference.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;   * If the GC detects that no handles for a particular cursor exist
&gt;     anymore, the underlying cursor object should be closed (which may
&gt;     free external resources such as locks).  At this time, all "equal"
&gt;     handles become invalid, subsequent operations will fail.
&gt; 
&gt;   * If the GC detects that no handles for some table object exist, and
&gt;     there are no handles for that table, this table is closed.
&gt;     Subsequent operations on "equal" table handles will fail.
&gt; 
&gt;   * The user may explicitly close a cursor handle.  In this case, the
&gt;     underlying object is closed, and the handle is marked invalid.
&gt;     (Same as above.)
&gt; 
&gt;   * The user may explicitly close a table handle.  In this case, all
&gt;     cursor which are still open are closed.  Future operations on
&gt;     them, or the table, will fail.
&gt;
&gt;   * When the program exits, all cursors and tables shall be closed,
&gt;     even if the program was termined by an exception.
&gt;
&gt; (Here, "to fail" means to raise an exception or some other kind of
&gt; deterministic error signaling mechanism.)

This will be hard to do if you really want to be complete.  Some run- 
time
errors (most notably, "out of memory") are not exceptions, they stop the
program immediately.  Moreover, under Unix there are signals that cannot
be caught or ignored.

&gt; Usually, application code will gracefully close all cursors, and the
&gt; table, but I want my library to be as safe as possible to use, and
&gt; avoid random crashes or memory leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a couple of approaches to implement the desired behavior:
&gt;
&gt;   (1) Just use weak arrays of tables and cursor, together with  
&gt; Gc.alarm.
&gt;
&gt;   (2) Use Gc.finalise for handler objects which contain an index into
&gt;       (plain) arrays of tables and cursors.  Use reference counting
&gt;       (or back pointers) to prevent premature finalization of table
&gt;       objects while there are still cursors around.

A simple pointer from the cursor to the table should be enough.

&gt;   (3) Same as (2), but using custom blocks and C code.

You'd need reference counts in this case.

I can't see how (1) would work.  (2) is normal if your objects are
implemented as OCaml data structures.  (3) if they are implemented by  
some
C library.

&gt;   (4) Some hybrid approach.

&gt; I'm not exactly happy with each appraoch because it seems I must
&gt; implement a simple memory manager on my own for managing the array
&gt; elements.  Perhaps I'm missing something?

Maybe simply that when you implement a program, you have to do some of
the work, the GC cannot do everything for you...

&gt; How is the performance of the three approaches?  Each one uses a
&gt; different GC mechanism to achieve its goals, so I'm a bit puzzled.

Different mechanisms for solving different problems.

&gt; Is anyone still using the clever ioXML syntax extension by Daniel de Rauglaudre? 
&gt;   Has anyone updated it to ocaml 3.08.4? 3.09.0?
&gt; 
&gt; I believe Maxence's Cameleon used to depend on it. Is it still so?

Hello Alex,

I had to update it in cameleon, since I encountered errors with "loc" ids.
I changed all "loc" variables in the code to "_loc" (file pa_ioXML.ml).

Later, I was told that the -loc option of camlp4 was made for this usage.
So a 'camlp4 -loc fooo' should work, but I did not test.
