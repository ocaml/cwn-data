I would like to somehow enforce that a variant type is associated with 
an entry in a data list. 

For example, 

I would like to define: 

type license = GPL | LGPL 

and 

let data = [ GPL, "GNU Public license"; 
             LGPL, "GNU Lesser General Public license" ] 

I would like to enforce that all variants of license are in the 
association list. 

I have tried to use polymorphic variants, but don't see how to enforce 
this constraint. 

The point, is that if I add a new variant to license (e.g. BSD3), the 
compiler output an error because this new variant is not in data list. 

Any ideas ? If you need to use another type expression rather than 
variant, please do so, as long as I am able to link the license type 
and data list. 
      </pre><i>bluestorm suggested:</i><br /><pre>
I do not have a direct solution to your problem. 

If you want to associate a data with each case, you can use a pattern 
matching, wich will do the exhaustiveness check : 

let to_string : license -&gt; _ = function 
| `GPL -&gt; "GPL" 
| `LGPL -&gt; "LGPL" 

You will be warned if you add (or remove) some licenses and forget to 
change the function. 

You may, however, want to have a list of all licenses values, instead 
of a case-handling on each value. I don't know how you could have the 
compiler check completeness for you, but if you really want that 
check, there is an extra-linguistic method : declare your value 
without giving it a type annotation, so that the compiler will infer 
the covered case, then use a script outside the program, calling 
"ocamlc -i" to check the inferred signature, and comparing it to you 
datatype declaration. 

Finally, I have a third solution based on code generation : given my 
first solution (turning the association list into a function), what 
you need is only a list of all the constructors (and you can build 
your assoc list with List.map (fun x -&gt; x, assoc_function x)). This 
can easily be generated from the datatype declaration using direct 
camlp4, or Markus Mottl's type-conv ( 
<a href="http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html#toc11">http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html#toc11</a> ). 
      </pre><i>Oleg suggested:</i><br /><pre>
In other words, you would like a set of values of a distinct type, 
each of which is associated with a printable string. One should be 
able to add to the set in some `authorized way'; one should not be 
able to make a value of that distinct type in an unauthorized way 
(that is, by accident). Right? 

It seems the following solution then would satisfy the specification: 

module LICENSE : sig 
  type t 
  val print_lic : t -&gt; string 
  val gpl  : t 
  val lgpl : t 
  (* more can be added *) 
end = struct 
  type t = string 
  let print_lic x = x 
  let gpl  = "GNU Public license" 
  let lgpl = "GNU Lesser General Public license" 
end;; 

(* Usage example *) 
type package = {pkg_name : string; pkg_lic : LICENSE.t};; 
let packages = [{pkg_name = "gcc";    pkg_lic = LICENSE.gpl}; 
                {pkg_name = "lgpled"; pkg_lic = LICENSE.lgpl}] 
;; 
let rec pr_lics = function [] -&gt; () 
 | {pkg_lic = l}::t -&gt; Printf.printf "%s\n" (LICENSE.print_lic l); 
                       pr_lics t 
;; 
let rec all_of_lic l = function [] -&gt; [] 
  | {pkg_name = name; pkg_lic = l'}::t when l' == l -&gt; name :: all_of_lic l t 
  | _::t -&gt; all_of_lic l t 
;; 

all_of_lic LICENSE.lgpl packages;; 

One can't overlook specifying the description string. One can't create 
new values of the type LICENSE.t `by accident' (the only possible 
values of the type are the ones exported by the module). 
      </pre><i>Maxence Guesdon suggested:</i><br /><pre>
Here is another solution, based on oug[1]. The idea is to:
1. make oug analyse your source files and dump the result,
2. write a program loading the dump and performing the checks you want.

Here is an example, which performs 1. and 2., with only one source file
"foo.ml".

=== myoug.ml
let (data, _) = Ouglib.Analyze.analyze ["foo.ml"];;

let number_variants =
 Ouglib.Lang.filter_elements data
   (Ouglib.Lang.Name
    {
      Ouglib.Lang.sel_name = "Foo.number.*" ;
      sel_kind = [ Ouglib.Data.Type_field ] ;
    }
   )
;;

let numbers_list_id =
 match
   Ouglib.Lang.filter_elements data
     (Ouglib.Lang.Name
      {
        Ouglib.Lang.sel_name = "Foo.numbers" ;
        sel_kind = [ Ouglib.Data.Value ] ;
      }
     )
 with
   [id] -&gt; id
 | _ -&gt; assert false
;;

let graph = data.Ouglib.Data.graph ;;
let created_by_numbers_list =
 let l = Ouglib.Graph.succ graph numbers_list_id in
 let f acc (id, k) =
   match k with
     Ouglib.Data.Create -&gt; id :: acc
   | _ -&gt; acc
 in
 List.fold_left f [] l
;;

let (_,missing) =
 List.partition (fun id -&gt; List.mem id created_by_numbers_list) number_variants
;;

match missing with
 [] -&gt; exit 0
| _ -&gt;
   let b = Buffer.create 256 in
   Ouglib.Dump.print_element_list data b  missing;
   prerr_endline
     (Printf.sprintf "The following constructors are not present in Foo.numbers:\n%s"
      (Buffer.contents b)
     );
   exit 1
;;
=== /myoug.ml ==

=== foo.ml ===
type number = One | Two | Three | Four;;

let numbers = [ One, 1 ; Two, 2 ];;
=== /foo.ml ==

Compilation of myoug.ml to myoug.x:
# ocamlc -I +oug str.cma toplevellib.cma oug.cma -o myoug.x myoug.ml 

Launching myoug.x gives the following:
The following constructors are not present in Foo.numbers:
f Foo.number.Three
f Foo.number.Four

Of course, you can adapt the program to fit your needs: have a makefile
target to create the oug dump and use this dump in various checking
programs, or in one program performing various checks.

Hope this helps,

Maxence

Thank you for all your answer. I pick the one from oleg@okmij.org, I
hide the license with a type and the creation of license is done in the
module. The to_string/from_string is done by registering extra data in
an Hashtable.

See the implementation here.

Following a number of bug fixes, and particularly a serious
incompatibility in ocaml 3.12 (due to the fixing of an old typing
bug), here is a new release of LablGtk2, the ocaml interface to the
Gtk+ GUI library and friends (glade, rsvg, gnomecanvas, gnomedruid,
panel, gtkspell, gtksourceview2.)

You can find it at:

 <a href="http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html">http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html</a>

The windows release will have to wait for a windows version of ocaml
3.12...

In Lablgtk-2.14.2:

2010.09.09 [Jacques]
 * add GtkCurve (but it is deprecated since 2.20)

2010.08.16 [Jacques]
 * rename g_value_{get,set}_variant, as the name is used by recent
   versions of glib (reported by Florent Monnier)

2010.07.25 [Jacques]
 * add changed signal to cell_renderer_combo (reported by Dmitry Bely)

2010.07.23 [Jacques]
 * copy GtkTreePath arguments in callbacks, as reported by Benjamin.

2010.06.25 [Jacques]
 * remove gtkInit.cmo from gdk_pixbuf_mlsource, no need to
   initialize Gtk as Gobject is sufficient 
 * protect GtkThread callbacks against exceptions, and provide a
   function to process messages inside a different main loop.
 * add -nothinit option to lablgtk2, since Quartz cannot run the main
   loop in a different thread (one should just call GtkThread.main).
   See dialog-thread.ml for an example.

2010.06.08 [Jacques]
 * correct interfaces due to the fixing of an unsoundness bug in ocaml 3.12

&gt; &gt; I am trying to use your Ancient module to avoid having the garbage
&gt; &gt; collector spends lots of time iterating over huge data in memory. It
&gt; &gt; works quite well for arrays but for hashtbl I have some problems
&gt; &gt; where I am not able to find back keys that were clearly in the
&gt; &gt; original hashtbl (before Ancient.mark it).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the doc it says: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (1) Ad-hoc polymorphic primitives (structural equality, marshalling
&gt; &gt; and hashing) do not work on ancient data structures, meaning that you
&gt; &gt; will need to provide your own comparison and hashing functions.  
&gt; 
&gt; The issue is described by Xavier Leroy:
&gt; <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2006/09/977818689f4ceb2178c592453df7a343.en.html">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2006/09/977818689f4ceb2178c592453df7a343.en.html</a>
&gt; 
&gt; As far as my understanding goes, what happens is that the OCaml
&gt; compare function (or some C equivalent in the runtime) looks at the
&gt; two string pointers and decides that since both are out of the normal
&gt; heap they are just opaque objects.  Thus it won't compare the content
&gt; of the strings, but will just do pointer equality.  This massively
&gt; breaks assumptions in some ordinary OCaml code, in this instance in
&gt; Hashtbl.

There is now a way to change this. You can call caml_page_table_add
(since 3.11) to explicitly declare a memory region as containing Ocaml
values. The polymorphic comparison, the hash primitive, and marshalling
work then.

There is support for this in Ocamlnet-3:
