** Dmitrii Kovanikov announced


I started writing a series on *Pragmatic Category Theory for Beginners* focusing on real-world use cases rather than theory. All code examples are in OCaml.

The first part was just finished:
- [[https://dev.to/chshersh/pragmatic-category-theory-part-1-semigroup-intro-1ign][Part 1: Semigroup Intro]]

It's just the beginning, and I have plans to describe more and provide more examples in future parts. I also plan to make a video version as well.

I hope you'll enjoy it!
      



* ppxlib.0.33.0

** Nathan Rebours announced


The Ppxlib dev team is happy to announce the release of ~ppxlib.0.33.0~.

You can find the full changelog for this release [[https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/releases/tag/0.33.0][here]].

*** Warning silencing for ~[@@deriving ..]~ generated code

This release's main feature is a series of improvement to flags controlling unused value/module/type warnings silencing.

The ~ppxlib~ driver generates warning silencing items to prevent ~[@@deriving ...]~
generated code to trigger unused code warnings. Three warnings are disabled that
way:
- Warning 32: unused value
- Warning 60: unused module
- Warning 34: unused type

The first two are disabled for values and modules generated by the deriver while the third is disabled for the types in the type declaration to which the ~[@@deriving ...]~ attribute is attached.

This feature was added a long time ago to avoid manually disabling those warnings when working with derivers that generate a set of values and modules only to use a subset of those. Alternatively, the unused type warning silencing was added to allow defining an alias type only to be consumed by a deriver, e.g.:
#+begin_src ocaml
type error = [`Not_found | `Invalid_arg] [@@deriving to_string]
#+end_src

We since then believe that we should not disable warnings lightly, as this behaviour makes it difficult to find and remove dead code. The right approach in those situations should be to fix the PPX derivers so that they are more configurable and can be used without triggering such warnings.

We will start to move toward removing this feature, but since it is still useful in some places, we had to come up with a plan to allow transitioning out of it.

In ~ppxlib.0.31.0~ we added the ~-unused-code-warnings~ driver flag and the
~?unused_code_warnings~'s ~Deriving.V2.make~ optional argument to control whether to silence Warnings 32 and 60. When both are set to ~true~, by the user and the deriver authors, the warnings are not silenced.

As of ~ppxlib.0.33.0~, these also control the silencing of Warning 34 (unused type). ~force~ can now be passed to the ~-unused-code-warnings~ flag in order to disable warnings silencing, regardless of the derivers opting in.

This allows users to test whether their codebase and their set of derivers rely on warning silencing or not and to use those results to eliminate dead code and/or report issues upstream to the derivers they use.

We also added a separate ~-unused-type-warnings~ flag that works similarly to
~-unused-code-warnings~ (i.e., depends on the value of the ~?unused_code_warnings~ argument), but it only controls Warning 34 silencing, as it turns out it is less likely to cause unwanted warnings than with the other two. This will allow users to disable it more easily, without having to deal with Warnings 32 and 60 straight away.

We want to encourage users to try those on their codebase in order to see the impact it has. Did you have dead code lying around that slipped past undetected? Does this trigger unwanted warnings because of deriver's generated code?

The plan is to give the ecosystem some time to try those features and adapt by fixing individual derivers and flipping ~?unused_code_warnings~ to true as they do. After a while, we will swap the default value of the driver flag to ~true~ so that only derivers that haven't opted in will enable warning silencing. Then as time goes we will swap the default of the ~Deriving.make~ argument so that derivers will instead have to explicitly opt out to get the warning silencing. Finally, once we are confident the ecosystem is in a good enough state, we will remove this feature altogether.

*** Other features

~ppxlib.0.33.0~ also comes with a couple of new features for PPX authors:
- A couple new ~Ast_builder~ functions: ~elist_tail~ and ~plist_tail~
  that can be used to build list expressions and patterns with a custom tail:
  ~elist_tail [expr1; expr2] tail_expr~ returns the expression for
  ~expr1::expr2::tail_expr~.
- ~Context_free.special_function'~, a new version of ~special_function~ that
  allows passing a ~Longident.t~ directly rather that relying on parsing the
  string argument to a ~Longident.t~.

Finally, the release includes a few bug fixes to ~Longident.parse~ and
~Code_path.main_module_name~ and fixes the ~location-check~ flag so it is not
required to also pass ~-check~ to enable location checks. It also fixes the 5.2
migrations locations, as we used to build nodes with inconsistent locations when
migrating ~Pexp_function~ nodes.

*** Huge thanks to our external contributors

We would like to thank our external contributors who have been a huge part of this release: @octachron, @vg-b, and @jchavarri, and a special mention to @mbarbin, who has not only contributed a lot to the warning silencing features but has been extensively testing and providing very useful feedback on them.

And of course, as usual, we'd like to thank the OCaml Software Foundation who has been funding my work on Ppxlib and on this release, making all of this possible!

I am happy to announce, on behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, the release of ~ocaml-lsp-server~ ~1.19.0~ and associated libraries. This release primary goal is to bring official support for OCaml 5.2 🐫.

*** Features

- Add custom [~ocamllsp/getDocumentation~](/ocaml-lsp-server/docs/ocamllsp/getDocumentation-spec.md) request (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1336)
- Add support for OCaml 5.2 (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1233)

*** Fixes

- Kill unnecessary ocamlformat processes with sigterm rather than sigint or
  sigkill (ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1343)
      



* MlFront - A packaging system for OCaml

** jbeckford announced


Here are the introductory paragraphs from its overview:

#+begin_quote
~MlFront~ adds a Java-like packaging system to OCaml. The ~MlFront~ name is a homage to ~cfront~ which was tooling that translated "C with Classes" (now known as C++) into C code. Similarly, ~MlFront~-based tools can translate OCaml with packages into conventional OCaml.
...
At its most basic core, ~MlFront~ gives a well-defined, consistent meaning to a module reference like ~AcmeWidgets_Std.Activities.Manufacturing~ across the domains of:

1. OCaml source code.
2. findlib libraries.
3. opam packages.
#+end_quote

~MlFront~ is Apache 2.0 licensed and is meant to be used by build systems (Dune, ocamlbuild, DkCoder) and package managers (opam). One of its critical dependencies is [[https://github.com/Octachron/codept][codept]].

You can read more about ~MlFront~ in the following posts (with more coming):

- [[https://diskuv.com/mlfront/overview-1/][https://diskuv.com/mlfront/overview-1/]]
- [[https://diskuv.com/mlfront/overview-2/][https://diskuv.com/mlfront/overview-2/]]

/Cross-post notice: The first article was posted at [[https://lobste.rs/s/7ghslo/overview_ocamlfront][https://lobste.rs/s/7ghslo/overview_ocamlfront]]; no comments (:(). But I still like to get first-hand feedback on what works well in other languages, so please chime in even if you don't feel that OCaml is your strong suit./

** Sabine Schmaltz announced


Welcome to the July 2024 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This update has been compiled by the OCaml.org maintainers. You can find [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/ocamlorg-newsletter][previous updates]] on Discuss.

Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants to get started and be productive in OCaml. The OCaml.org newsletter provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview of the changes we are working on.

We couldn't do it without all the amazing people who help us review, revise, and create better OCaml documentation and work on issues. Your participation enables us to so much more than we could just by ourselves. Thank you!

This newsletter covers:
- *Community-Driven Development of OCaml.org*
- *Recipes for the OCaml Cookbook:* Help us make the OCaml Cookbook really useful by contributing and reviewing recipes for common tasks!
- *Community & Marketing Pages Rework:* Implementation work in progress.
- *General Improvements:* As usual, we also worked on general maintenance and improvements, so we're highlighting some of the work that happened below.

*** Community-Driven Development of OCaml.org

After reworking most of the OCaml.org website to be more useful, more usable, and nicer to look at, the team at Tarides that has been working on OCaml.org is disbanding. However, OCaml.org will continue to be maintained and extended by by the OCaml Platform and OCaml compiler contributors, as well as by the wider OCaml community.

You can reach out to [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org?tab=readme-ov-file#maintainers][the OCaml.org maintainers]] to discuss any bigger changes or additions you'd like to make. Contributions to improve existing features and bug fixes are always welcome!

**** Open Issues for Contributors

You can find [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee][open issues for contributors here]]!


*** Recipes for the OCaml Cookbook

The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to solve common tasks using packages from the ecosystem.

A recipe is a code sample and explanations on how to perform a task using a combination of open-source libraries.

The Cookbook is live at [[https://ocaml.org/cookbook][ocaml.org/cookbook]].

Here's how you can help:

1. Help review the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ACookbook][open pull requests for cookbook recipes]]!
2. Contribute new recipes and tasks for the cookbook!

Thank you all for the many contributions! One area where we could use help is in reviewing and improving the suggested recipes and tasks.
