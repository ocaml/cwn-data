  The OCaml Workshop will be held virtually, just like last year. We are
  looking for volunteers to fill the role of session host.


[Session Hosts]
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  On August 27, the session hosts will assist session chairs in
  streaming the pre-recorded videos as well as helping and moderating
  the Q&A sessions. They will also be responsible for security and be
  ready to react to potential threats and wrongdoers.

  This year there will be only one broadcast for each session, but the
  workshop day will be quite long. There will be six sessions, lasting
  one hour and a half, as well as a one hour keynote.

opam 2.1.0!
═══════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-0/8255/1>


R. Boujbel announced
────────────────────

  We are happy to announce two opam releases: the freshly new [2.1.0] &
  the LTS support [2.0.9].


[2.1.0] <https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.1.0>

[2.0.9] <https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.9>

What's new in opam 2.1.0?
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Integration of system dependencies (formerly the `opam-depext`
    plugin), increasing their reliability as it integrates the solving
    step
  • Creation of lock files for reproducible installations (formerly the
    `opam-lock` plugin)
  • Switch invariants, replacing the _"base packages"_ in opam 2.0 and
    allowing for easier compiler upgrades
  • Improved options configuration (see the new `option` and expanded
    `var` sub-commands)
  • CLI versioning, allowing cleaner deprecations for opam now and also
    improvements to semantics in future without breaking
    backwards-compatibility
  • opam root readability by newer and older versions, even if the
    format changed
  • Performance improvements to opam-update, conflict messages, and many
    other areas

  You'll find these features presentation in the [blog post] ; and for a
  full complete you can take a look [pre-releases changelogs].

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This 2.0.9 version contains back-ported fixes, you can find more
  information in this [blog post], especially for fish users & sandbox
  updates.

  *Tremendous thanks to all involved people, all those who've tested,
   re-tested, tested again, given feedback, commented on issues, tested,
   tested, tested again…!*

  I'm glad to announce that version 3.5 of [containers] has just been
  released. There's a bugfix for bitvectors, and a tasteful assortment
  of new functions (see changelog). I want to thank all the
  contributors, among whom first time contributor @favonia.

  We have a small project (possibly only days of work) for an
  experienced OCaml and C++ programmer. If you are available for a short
  engagement as a contractor, please DM me. Thank you.


http-multipart-formdata v3.0.1 released
═══════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-http-multipart-formdata-v3-0-1-released/8261/1>


Bikal Lem announced
───────────────────

  I am pleased to announce v3.0.1 of `http-multipart-formdata'. This
  release follows a major overhaul of the parser as well as the design
  of the library. Here is the summary of changes:

  1. Flatten module `Part_header' to `part_header'
  2. Implement reader/pull based parser to retrieve multipart parts,
     i.e. implement a `streaming' design. This is very useful if the
     HTTP file upload is large.
  3. Implement push-based incremental input model, i.e. the library is
     now a non-blocking multipart parser
  4. Remove dependency on IO based libs such as `lwt, async' since it is
     no longer needed due to point 3 above.

wtr (Well Typed Router) v2.0.0 released
═══════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-wtr-well-typed-router-v2-0-0-released/8262/1>


Bikal Lem announced
───────────────────

  I am pleased to announce v2.0.0 release of `wtr (Well Typed
  Router)'. `wtr' is a trie-based router for OCaml HTTP web
  applications.

  v2.0.0 release adds support for specifying and matching HTTP methods
  in a router. So now we can do the following;
  ┌────
  │ Wtr.(
  │     create
  │       [ {%wtr| get,post,head,delete  ; /home/about/  |} about_page
  │       ; {%wtr| head                  ; /home/:int/   |} prod_page
  │       ]
  └────
  Note: we can specify single or multiple HTTP methods supported by a
  route.

  The release also features a pretty-printer - `Wtr.pp' - for a `Wtr.t'
  type. This has proven to be very useful when diagnosing/understanding
  routing issues. Sample output below,
  ┌────
  │ POST
  │   /home
  │     /about
  │       /
  │     /:float
  │       /
  │ HEAD
  │   /home
  │     /about
  │       /
  │     /:int
  │       /
  └────

  The manual has also been improved in this release.

  Haven't watched them all yet, but these look like they'd be a great
