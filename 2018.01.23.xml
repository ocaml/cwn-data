      <cwn_who>Deep in this thread, Hannes Mehnert said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
since you mention my logs-syslog package here, let me answer you . ;)

- Lwt_logs now moved to a separate repository (see
https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/468 and
&lt;https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/pull/484&gt;). NB: I never used Lwt_logs and can't
answer your initial question about syslog support.
- logs-syslog "depends on lot of external libraries": my perception is
different, it requires `ocamlfind`, `ocamlbuild`, and `topkg` for building, plus
`logs`, `ptime`, and `syslog-message` (which itself depends additionally on
`astring`) at runtime.
The [logs library](&lt;http://erratique.ch/software/logs/doc/Logs.html#basics&gt;) is
very convenient to use IMHO, and has builtin support for both terminal, but also
browser console (when cross-compiling to JS). I wrote logs-syslog to solve the
exact problem - exfiltrating log messages via syslog - once logs was adopted
more widely (at least by the MirageOS community, see
&lt;https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release#Logs-Where-You-Want-Them&gt;).
Others (at Docker) wrote reporters for both [Apply system
log](&lt;https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-asl&gt;) and [Windows event
log](&lt;https://github.com/djs55/ocaml-win-eventlog&gt;).
The syslog-message library does not yet support structured syslog ([RFC
5424](&lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424&gt;)), apart from that the logs-syslog
library supports three transports, UDP, TCP, TLS (including client
authentication) - and 3 backends: Unix (OCaml stdlib), Lwt, MirageOS. Please let
me know if you have a specific use case not covered by logs-syslog. Further
reading about the MirageOS syslog integration is available at

      <cwn_title>Sequence 1.0</cwn_title>

      <cwn_what>
I have the pleasure to announce that
[sequence](&lt;https://github.com/c-cube/sequence&gt;) has reached its version 1.0.
Sequence is a lightweight, high-performance library of iterators that is
compatible with existing `iter` functions. Sequence 1.0 is a breaking release
that comes with some simplification of the API and a bump of the minimum
supported OCaml version to 4.02 that comes from jbuilder.

      <cwn_what>
This is great, thank you!

Is there a writeup somewhere on how to pick between sequence and
[gen](&lt;https://github.com/c-cube/gen&gt;)? Both seem similar in intent. Is one
generally a better choice than the other?
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Simon Cruanes replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I just wrote a basic explanation here:
https://github.com/c-cube/sequence#comparison-with-a-href-https-github-com-c-cube-gen-gen-a
. I'll try to expand it if it's not clear enough.

      <cwn_who>Damien Doligez announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The release of OCaml version 4.06.1 is imminent.  We have
created a release candidate for your testing pleasure.  Please
try it and let me know whether it works for you.

We want to know about any show-stopping bugs, especially in the
compilation and installation phases.

This release candidate is available as an opam switch:
  opam switch 4.06.1+rc1

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.

      <cwn_who>Simon Cruanes announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I have  the pleasure  to announce that containers 2.0+alpha1 is being released.

[containers](&lt;https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers&gt;) is a modular,
ightweight, and performant extension of the standard library. Version 2.0
introduces a monomorphic mode (thanks to @jpdeplaix) that is designed to prevent
errors caused by the polymorphic "magic" operators such as `(=)`. This breaking
release is also the occasion to switch to dune, and to fix some inconsistencies
in the API (mostly printers).

If you use containers, please give a try to 2.0+alpha1 and report any issue on
the bucktracker!
