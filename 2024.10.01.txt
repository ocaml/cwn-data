  Hello folks! :wave:


Call for Feedback
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  We'd like to welcome everyone to try and play with the [Dune Developer
  Preview]! :tada:

  This experimental nightly release of dune includes a lot of
  improvements, including the much expected package management features,
  and it can be installed from that website or by using the new
  installation script:

  ┌────
  │ $ curl https://dune.ci.dev/install | bash
  └────

  In a few seconds you should be ready to OCaml by calling `dune' – you
  can watch a demo of this here: [X], [Mastodon].

  Please try it out and let us know what you think :pray:

  :calendar: You can book a feedback call with us [here]

  :memo: You can submit feedback using [this form]

  :bug: You can submit issues to Github on [ocaml/dune]

Changes since last update
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The Dune shared cache has been enabled by default. We're starting off
  by caching all downloads and dependencies.

  We have improved support for dev tools. We're working to streamline
  this but in the latest binary you can:

  • Configure your LSP (in Neovim, Vim, Emacs, etc) to call `dune tools
    exec ocamllsp' to get LSP support for your projects out of the box –
    this may take a little bit the first time it builds the LSP for a
    compiler version, but its pretty much instant afterwards.
  • Call `dune fmt' to get your project formatted – remember to add an
    `.ocamlformat' file if you don't have one yet. An empty one is
    enough.
  • Call `dune ocaml doc' to get documentation built


What's next?
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  We're looking forward to streamlining the DX, working on better
  dependency locks, and looking into supporting Windows.

  In particular, we're considering work on a few things:

  • `dune create <repo>' – to let the community create templates that
    can be easily used from within dune
  • `dune pkg fetch' – to prefetch packages and prepare a repository for
    working in offline mode
  • `dune build @deps' - to build all dependencies, useful for staged
    builds in Dockerfiles
  • `dune pkg add <name>' - to make adding packages straightforward
  • a short-hand syntax for pins on github
  • and more!

  If you've got any ideas, we'd love to hear them, so please open a
  feature request on Github :pray:

◊ FunOCaml Presentation

  At *FunOCaml* we had a last-minute opportunity to present the work
  being done on Dune and we used it to introduce the Developer Preview
  to the community, and even tested Package Management live with
  suggestions from the audience (thanks @anmonteiro and Paul-Elliot for
  participating!) – you can [watch it on Twitch].


  [watch it on Twitch]
  <https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2252408016?t=08h12m00s>


◊ New design

  We're working with @Claire_Vandenberghe on redesigning the Developer
  Preview website so that it'd feel like a seamless extension of
  OCaml.org – in this current iteration we've made it easier to get
  started and we're putting the FAQ front and center.

  We'll be iterating on this design in the coming weeks until it fits
  perfectly within the OCaml.org design system :art:

  You can check the new website here: <https://dune.ci.dev>


◊ Upcoming Blog posts

  In the near future we'll be publishing blog posts about the Developer
  Preview and Package Management, which we're working on with
  @professor.rose :clap:


Uuidm 0.9.9
═══════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-uuidm-0-9-9/15336/1>


Daniel Bünzli announced
───────────────────────

  There's a new release of [Uuidm], a library to handle universally
  unique identifiers (UUIDs).

  This very old module has been slightly renovated implying a few
  deprecations, a [quick start] has been added to the docs and foremost
  new constructors and generators were added to support the latest [RFC
  9562] V7 time and random based UUID definitions; thanks to `xen-api'
  folks for getting the ball rolling on this. See the [release notes]
  for the details.

  • Docs: [online] or `odig doc uuidm'
  • Install: `opam install uuidm' ([PR])

  A big thanks to my [donors].

first release of ppx_deriving_jsonschema
════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-ppx-deriving-jsonschema/15320/2>


Louis Roché announced
─────────────────────

  Released 0.0.2 on opam. It feels like the project is in a good shape
  now.

  Changes:
  • support for nativeint, bytes, ref, unit
  • add ~variant_as_array for compatibility with ppx_deriving_yojson
  • support variant payloads
  • support polymorphic variants inheritance
  • fix encoding of tuples
  • change encoding of variants from enum to anyOf

  I'm considering making `variant_as_array' the default in 0.0.3 as it
  would be more consistent with the ocaml ecosystem.


Bogue, the OCaml GUI
════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-bogue-the-ocaml-gui/9099/62>


sanette announced
─────────────────

  I'm happy to announce a brand new version of [Bogue], version
  20240928, now availble on `opam'.

  Changes are mostly under the hood. We have nice improvements by @edwin
  : automatic monitor vsync is now enabled by default, for smoother
  animations, and most importantly *we finally align with the latest
  version of `tsdl'*. It will simplify maintenance, but it also implies
  that *too old versions of SDL will not work anymore*. On the other
  hand we were kind of obliged to move forward, because `tsdl.0.9.8'
  won't install on `ocaml 5.2'.

  • if you're on Ubuntu 20.04, installing Bogue with `opam install
    bogue' will by default pull `tsdl.1.1.0' in, which requires SDL >=
    2.0.18, not shipped by the OS. A workaround is to explicitly require
    `opam install tsdl.1.0.0' (or manually installing a newer SDL)
  • if your OS ships SDL < 2.0.10 you have no other choice than manually
    installing a newer [SDL] (which is not that complicated)

  Happy bogue-ing!

New release of Merlin
═════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-merlin/15358/1>


vds announced
─────────────

  I am very pleased to announce a new release of Merlin for OCaml 5.2,
  5.1 and 4.14. This release brings a handful of fixes but also a
  handful of of new commands:

  • `signature_help' and `inlay_hint' have been upstreamed from
    `ocaml-lsp-server'
  • `expand_node' a command to get the ppxed-source when called on
    relevant annotations
  • 🕵️‍♀️ `search-by-type' a [sherlodoc]-inspired syntax to search for
    values in the environment, that superseeds `polarity-search'.

  Only `search-by-type' has an Emacs binding right now (and one for vim
  on is [in the works]), we hope to have some time to work on more
  client implementations in the near future.

Hannes Mehnert announced
────────────────────────

  Dear OCaml developers,

  we're pleased to finally release a full stack of packages that do not
  rely on Cstruct.t/Bigarray, but use string / bytes instead. This
  brings us a massive performance boost (e.g. a factor of 3 in tls), and
  brings a easier to comprehend API. It also makes performance tooling
  work much more smoothly with our released packages. We announced this
  upcoming change earlier this year
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mirage-crypto-0-11-3-with-more-speed-for-elliptic-curves-and-the-future-roadmap-of-mirage-crypto>

  For further details, please see the specific release pages:
  • [mirage-crypto 1.0.0] (also [1.0.1], and [1.1.0]) - cryptographic
    operations in OCaml (symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers (RSA,
    DSA, DH), fortuna (a cryptographic secure pseudo random number
    generator), elliptic curves (from [fiat-crypto]) – the hash
    algorithms have been removed - use [digestif] instead
  • [tls 1.0.0] (also [1.0.1], [1.0.2], and [1.0.3]) - a Transport layer
    security implementation (HTTPS) in OCaml, supporting TLS 1.0, 1.1,
    1.2, and 1.3
  • [x509 1.0.0] (also [1.0.1], [1.0.2], [1.0.3], and [1.0.4]) - X509
    certificates (signing requests, certificate revocation lists,
    PKCS12)
  • [asn1-combinators 0.3.0] (also [0.3.1] and [0.3.2]) - ASN.1 parser
    combinators
  • [let's encrypt 1.0.0] - a client for <https://letsencrypt.org> -
    automated TLS certificate issuance
  • [awa 0.4.0] - a SSH client and server implementation
  • [kdf 1.0.0] - supporting different key derivation functions: hkdf
    (used in TLS), PBKDF2, SCRYPT
  • [paf 0.7.0] - protocol-agnostic client (http / http2)
  • [git 3.17.0] - an implementation of the version control system git
    <https://git-scm.com>
  • [dns 9.0.0] (also [9.0.1]) - an implementation of the domain name
    system

  As you can envision, there was a lot of coordination and releasing
  involved in preparing these API-breaking changes. The list above
  likely misses various packages that have been released to support the
  new mirage-crypto and tls API.

  There have already been various issues reported and fixed in the
  subsequent minor releases. We encourage you to upgrade your software
  stack to the new release series, and report issues while you encounter
  them (being it API questions, or correctness issues). Earlier releases
  are not maintained anymore (due to lack of interest and lack of time),
  thus if you encounter issues in earlier releases, please first update
  to the most recent releases (although this may need some effort – a PR
  that uses the packages heavily is
  <https://github.com/robur-coop/miragevpn/pull/279>). If you're stuck
  or lack time to port your code to the new API, we at robur offer
  commercial support in upgrading your codebase. Reach out to us via
  email: team@robur.coop.

  This work has been conducted by the [robur collective]. Parts of this
  work was sponsored by Tarides.
