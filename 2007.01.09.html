&gt; I have wrapped a C library for use with Ocaml and didn't find 
&gt; the task too daunting. I have now found a C++ library that would 
&gt; be useful, but the Ocaml ORA book makes no mention of wrapping 
&gt; C++ libraries. 

you can only wrapp via C - functions 

&gt; Has anyone got any experience wrapping C++ libraries in Ocaml? 
&gt; Is it possible? Painful but doable? Too painful to think about? 

I have done it a few times, it's much typing :-) 
you must write a c function for the methods of the class you want to 
wrap and give them a pointer to the c++ class, so you can call the 
method there. Often you define on the c++ side an adapter class which 
delegates method calls to the ocaml side (f.e. when wrapping events from 
and to c++/ocaml). For big libraries it's a neverending task without 
more tools. 
There is the platinum framework (on sourceforge), a c++ class lib with a 
little gui. This lib compiles for win32, Linux, WinCE and qnx, I have 
done some wrapping to the gui part, together with the event handling and 
it works very nice (if you want to read it as an example). 

&gt; Any pointers or advice appreciated. 

Python, Ruby and Perl all have wrappers for QT and they use tools to 
generate the C interface I think. Maybe worth to look at...

In pidgin OCaml I'd like to write something like 

type complicated = 
    IVal of int 
    | StrVa, of string 
    | SymTableVal of symTable 
and 
    symTable = Map(string -&gt; complicated) 

I tried many variations on using the Map module to implement a recursive data 
structure like this.  I failed miserably.  (The above wasn't the syntax I ever 
used, but it gets the idea across.)   

However, when I create an object 
class [ 'key, 'content ] table : ('key -&gt; 'key -&gt; int) -&gt; 
object 
,,, 
end 

I can successfully declare 
type complicated = 
    IVal of int   
    | StrVal of string 
    | SymTableVal of (string, complicated) table 
that does what I want.   Ithis isn't the whole declaration of complicated, but 
I believe once I get this declaration working, the more quirky variations work 
too. 

Do I need one of the more advanced features of OCaml that I don't currently 
understand to use Map the way that I want without writing a whole table class?  
I don't even see how I can use Map from inside the table class to do what I 
want which would also be acceptable. 

I don't want to have to break open the Map module to modify it and thus change 
the licensing of my final program.

You need recursive modules, something like this: 
# module rec StringMap : Map.S = Map.Make(String) 
  and Symbols : sig 
    type t = 
      | IVal of int 
      | StrVal of string 
      | SymTableVal of t StringMap.t 
  end = struct 
    type t = 
      | IVal of int 
      | StrVal of string 
      | SymTableVal of t StringMap.t 
  end;; 
module rec StringMap : Map.S 
and Symbols : 
  sig 
    type t = IVal of int | StrVal of string | SymTableVal of t StringMap.t 
  end

I've just updated our Benefits of OCaml page with a more elegant symbolic 
computation example: 

  <a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/free/ocaml/symbolic.html">http://www.ffconsultancy.com/free/ocaml/symbolic.html</a> 

In particular, results are composed using a pair of non-trivial constructors 
that perform simple simplifications: 

# let rec ( +: ) f g = match f, g with 
    | Int n, Int m -&gt; Int (n + m) 
    | Int 0, f | f, Int 0 -&gt; f 
    | f, Add(g, h) -&gt; f +: g +: h 
    | f, g when f &gt; g -&gt; g +: f 
    | f, g -&gt; Add(f, g) 

  and ( *: ) f g = match f, g with 
    | Int n, Int m -&gt; Int (n * m) 
    | Int 0, _ | _, Int 0 -&gt; Int 0 
    | Int 1, f | f, Int 1 -&gt; f 
    | f, Mul(g, h) -&gt; f *: g *: h 
    | f, g when f &gt; g -&gt; g *: f 
    | f, g -&gt; Mul(f, g);; 
val ( +: ) : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt; 
val ( *: ) : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt; 

I'm also translating this into F# for my forthcoming book "F# for Scientists". 
Even on an example as simple as this, F# has some significant benefits: 

1. + and * can be overloaded for the expr type. 
2. User-defined types can have their own comparison functions. 
3. Set and Map are polymorphic (not functors). 

Hopefully F#'s active patterns will also allow operators in patterns, allowing 
code like: 

  let d f x = match f with 
    | Var v when x=v -&gt; Int 1 
    | Int _ | Var _ -&gt; Int 0 
    | f + g -&gt; d f x + d g x 
    | f * g -&gt; f * d g x + g * d f x 

and: 

    | f + (g + h) -&gt; (f + g) + h 

and so on.

&gt; Does this mean that unboxing is inefficient in OCaml?  I've written an 
&gt; alternative version of the C++ that returns NULL instead of out of bound 
&gt; values which was close to the same speed so it would be a little 
&gt; disappointing if I couldn't achieve something similar in OCaml with Some / 
&gt; None. 

It's not so much that boxing/unboxing is inefficient in OCaml, but 
rather that ocamlopt compiles exactly what you ask it to.  If you ask 
it to use a box, it uses a box!  (Well, mostly ...)

&gt; I've written some Ocaml code to solve the problem of placing 8 queens on a 
&gt; board so that none of them attack each-other. 

Your program is very verbose: many times longer than is necessary. Most of 
this verbosity can be attributed to performing various boxing, unboxing and 
allocation tasks that are superfluous and simply slow the code down. However, 
profiling suggests that you're also using a different algorithm in OCaml as 
the core functions are called many more times in the OCaml than in the C++. 
Contrast your code with a minimal program to solve the n-queens problem in 
OCaml: 

let rec unthreatened (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = 
  x1 &lt;&gt; x2 &amp;&amp; y1 &lt;&gt; y2 &amp;&amp; x2 - x1 &lt;&gt; y2 - y1 &amp;&amp; x1 - y2 &lt;&gt; x2 - y1;; 

let rec search n f qs ps = 
  if length qs = n then f qs else 
    iter (fun q -&gt; search n f (q::qs) (filter (unthreatened q) ps)) ps;; 

let ps = rev (flatten (init n (fun i -&gt; init n (fun j -&gt; i, j)))) 
search n f [] ps 

This program starts with a list of all board positions "ps" and simply filters 
out threatened positions as queens are added. Performance is poor compared to 
your C++: 

0.625s C++ (130 LOC) 
4.466s OCaml (28 LOC) 

My first solution is written for brevity and not performance so it is still 3x 
slower than the C++: 

The core of the program is just this: 

open List;; 

let print_board n queens = 
  for y=0 to n-1 do 
    for x=0 to n-1 do 
      print_string (if mem (x, y) queens then "Q" else ".") 
    done; 
    print_newline() 
  done; 
  print_newline();; 

let rec fold_n2 f accu x y n = 
  if y=n then accu else 
    if x=n then fold_n2 f accu 0 (y + 1) n else 
      fold_n2 f (f accu x y) (x + 1) y n;; 

let unthreatened (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = 
  x1 &lt;&gt; x2 &amp;&amp; y1 &lt;&gt; y2 &amp;&amp; x2 - x1 &lt;&gt; y2 - y1 &amp;&amp; x1 - y2 &lt;&gt; x2 - y1;; 

let rec search n f queens () x y = 
  if for_all (unthreatened (x, y)) queens then 
    if length queens = n - 1 then f ((x, y) :: queens) else 
      fold_n2 (search n f ((x, y) :: queens)) () (x + 1) y n;; 

then I wrote this to search once and print and then search a given number of 
times (for benchmarking): 

exception Queens of (int * int) list;; 

let _ = 
  let n = 8 in 
  let f qs = raise (Queens qs) in 
  (try search n f [] () 0 0 with Queens qs -&gt; print_board n qs); 
  match Sys.argv with 
  | [|_; reps|] -&gt; 
      for rep=2 to int_of_string reps do 
        try search n (fun _ -&gt; raise Exit) [] () 0 0 with Exit -&gt; () 
      done 
  | _ -&gt; () 

The "fold_n2" and "search" functions are both polymorphic folds. The former 
folds over a square array and the latter folds over all solutions to the 
n-queens problem. The generality of the "search" function is not used in this 
case, as I just print the first solution found and bail using an exception. 

On my machine, 1000 solutions takes: 

0.625s C++ (130 LOC) 
1.764s OCaml (30 LOC) 

So OCaml is &gt;4x more concise but 2.8x slower than C++. 

Profiling shows that a lot of time is spent in List.for_all. We can roll this 
ourselves to remove some polymorphism and improve performance: 

let rec unthreatened x1 y1 = function 
  | (x2, y2) :: t -&gt; 
      x1 &lt;&gt; x2 &amp;&amp; y1 &lt;&gt; y2 &amp;&amp; x2 - x1 &lt;&gt; y2 - y1 &amp;&amp; x1 - y2 &lt;&gt; x2 - y1 &amp;&amp; 
        unthreatened x1 y1 t 
  | [] -&gt; true;; 

let rec search n f queens () x y = 
  if unthreatened x y queens then 
    if length queens = n - 1 then f ((x, y) :: queens) else 
      fold_n2 (search n f ((x, y) :: queens)) () (x + 1) y n;; 

This gets the time down to: 

1.159s OCaml (33 LOC) 

We can continue optimising by removing some generality. Let's turn the "fold" 
into an "iter" so that "search" becomes monomorphic: 

let rec iter_n2 f x y n = 
  if y&lt;n then 
    if x=n then iter_n2 f 0 (y + 1) n else 
      (f x y; 
       iter_n2 f (x + 1) y n);; 

let rec search n f queens x y = 
  if unthreatened x y queens then 
    if length queens = n - 1 then f ((x, y) :: queens) else 
      iter_n2 (search n f ((x, y) :: queens)) (x + 1) y n;; 

Performance is improved even more, at the cost of generality. 

0.827s OCaml (34 LOC) 

So OCaml is now only 30% slower whilst still being ~4x more concise.

 I'm going to start teaching OCaml soon and I'm fishing for ideas and 
suggestions. I hope this list is the right place to ask. 

 Within a few weeks, I'll be teaching OCaml to a class of second-year 
students in _mathematics &amp; informatics_. The bad part is that their 
knowledge of computer science is limited to 3 term-long lectures of 
"algorithmics" (read "Java under Windows"), and that they have nil 
knowledge of Unix/Cygwin or Makefiles, or even Emacs or command-lines. 
The good part is that a number of them consider Java "not mathematical 
enough", so they may be good candidates for functional programming. 

 I'm planning to base my lecture roughly on part 1 of _Developing 
applications with Objective Caml_, perhaps replacing the chapter devoted 
to Graphics with the use of LablGTK. Then again, perhaps not. Some 
low-level graphics might be interesting for them. I also intend to give 
them a term-long project to work on and develop. 

Right now, I see the following difficulties: 

* the environment -- under Windows, is there any viable alternative to 
Emacs + the MinGW-based port ? 

* the Makefile -- I've found OCamlMakefile [1] but I haven't tried it 
yet, hopefully it's simple enough for my students to use without too 
many arcane manipulations 

* the task -- for the moment, I have no interesting idea of OCaml-based 
projects. Perhaps something like finding the shortest path along 
subway/train lines ? 

Thanks for any idea/suggestion/comment, 
 David, 
  And a Happy New Year

&gt; * the Makefile -- I've found OCamlMakefile [1] but I haven't tried it

Have you looked at OMake - <a href="http://omake.metaprl.org/">http://omake.metaprl.org/</a> ? 
For simple OCaml projects, the OMakefile would be 1 line: 

DEFAULT: $(OCamlProgram prog_name, module1 module2 module3) 

It's easy to install on Windows and it is self-contained (you do not 
need GNU Make).
			</pre><i>Jacques Garrigue suggested:</i><br /><pre>
For the graphics, I would rather suggest lablTk. It is much easier to 
use for beginners. And you can even work interactively using the 
Tk.update command. 
&gt; * the environment -- under Windows, is there any viable alternative to 
&gt; Emacs + the MinGW-based port ? 

For writing programs, emacs helps a lot. In particular, the possibility 
to execute phrases in the toplevel while editing a file makes things 
much easier. Emacs looks scary, but for this specific case you only 
need a limited number of key combinations :-) 
Once you've installed Tcl/Tk (required for LablTk), then you can use 
ocamlbrowser. It can be helpful too, particularly for browsing the 
library. 
(These are very personal suggestions...)
			</pre><i>Andrej Bauer said:</i><br /><pre>
I teach theory of programming languages with ocaml on Windows. The path 
of least resistance seems to be ocaml + XEmacs + tuareg + premade make 
files (although omake sounds like a good option). It takes one lecture 
(45 minutes) to explain the setup, and the first homework is "install 
everything and compile helloWorld.ml". 
If you're teaching math students who think that "java is not 
mathematical" enough, then you could offer mathematical projects, 
possibly involving graphics, such as: 

1) A program that plots the graph of a function. This would involve 
parsing the function, so you'd have to teach basic lexing and parsing 
techniques. Or you can provide the lexer and parser and have them extend 
it with more functions. 

For extra credit: a program that plots surfaces in 3D. 

2) A program for drawing graphs in the plane. The layout of a graph is 
computed with one of many algorithms, e.g. a spring embedder. You can 
reuse the graph data structure to develop other things (shortest path 
etc.) You can have a graph drawing competition. You can have them draw 
graphs with 10000 vertices. 

I once "won over" several math students from the Dark Side++ by showing 
them how to define the datatype of finite graphs and implement basic 
constructions, including computing Cayley's graph and finding the 
chromatic numbers (by a brute force method). They were convinced because 
the source code was "mathematically clean" and something like 5 times 
shorter than corresponding C++ would be. 

3) This is shameless self-propaganda, but several people used random art 
as a fun project, see e.g. Assignment 2 at 
<a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2005/fall/cs131/homework/index.html">http://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2005/fall/cs131/homework/index.html</a> 
(and compare with the "real thing" at <a href="http://www.random-art.org">http://www.random-art.org</a>). In 
this project you can avoid writing parsers, while still having abstract 
syntax and an interpreter, or even a compiler/optimizer. 

4) If your students are very mathematical, something like the tiling 
examples from "Developing applications in Ocaml" might interest them.

I'm having some crashes with a threaded C program that calls

This discussion:

provides some good information, but I could use some more info. 
(And I hope this will make it into the manual at some point.) 

Specifically: 

The program is an ObjC program, a GUI wrapped around an ocaml program 
(Unison).  The ObjC program is multithreaded.  From the above discussion 
I realize that only one of the ObjC threads can call back to ocaml at 
any given time, therefore I have a lock for ocaml callbacks (a posix 
threads mutex). 

However, I still get crashes.  I think I must be missing some locking. 
So far I have locked ObjC calls to caml_callback, caml_callback_exn, 
etc.  I have not locked certain other calls of the caml C API, e.g., 

   caml_named_value() 
   caml_copy_string() 
   caml_remove_global_root() 
   caml_register_global_root() 
   Val_int() 
   Field() 
   String_val() 
   Wosize_val() 

If anyone knows exactly what parts of the ocaml C API need to be locked 
for this scenario, it would be nice to have that in the documentation. 

Also, I wonder whether there is any issue with having one ObjC thread 
in the ocaml runtime, while another ObjC thread accesses an object 
that is either an ocaml root or accessible from an ocaml root -- is 
any locking required?
			</pre><i>Markus Mottl answered:</i><br /><pre>
With the exception of "Val_int" none of the above is thread-safe.  Since the 
GC can move values at anytime while your C-thread is executing, any 
C-function that accepts or returns a "value" (= OCaml-value) is potentially 
unsafe.  Val_int is an exception, because OCaml-ints are unboxed (btw. 
unlike int32, int64, nativeint!).  Atomic (also atomic polymorphic) variants 
and characters, too, are unboxed and can therefore be safely handled by 
C-threads at any time. 
Furthermore, it is safe to access the contents of bigarrays if they cannot 
be reclaimed during that time (e.g. because you protected them before 
releasing the OCaml-lock using CAMLparam, etc.), because their contents is 
outside of the OCaml-heap. 

Otherwise never access OCaml-values from a C-thread if there are running 
OCaml-threads.  Here be dragons... 

If anyone knows exactly what parts of the ocaml C API need to be locked 

&gt; for this scenario, it would be nice to have that in the documentation. 

Yes, that would be nice indeed... 
Also, I wonder whether there is any issue with having one ObjC thread 

&gt; in the ocaml runtime, while another ObjC thread accesses an object
