      <cwn_title>OCaml native library to draw, scale, rotate shapes on screen</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-native-library-to-draw-scale-rotate-shapes-on-screen/6706/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Yoann asked announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Is there any library to easily draw shapes (circle, rectangles, etc.) and rotate or scale them, and
that also supports some alpha layer.

I know Graphics, but it does not look like you can rotate/scale/alpha easily shapes.
I know Cairo but it depends on lablgtk to draw things on the screen and I don't need any widgets and
I'd rather avoid dependencies to gtk.

For context I'm trying to port elm-playgound which allows to super easily code pictures, animations, or
games (see https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-playground/latest/ for its API).
I am almost done porting it in a Web context thanks to js_of_ocaml, ocaml-vdom, and the SVG support in
a browser, but I'd like now to port it in a native context.
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Armael replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm using the [ocaml-cairo](https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo) in a project, and it works
relatively well. The library is also very nicely documented (there's an ocaml translation of the cairo
tutorial, and various examples). Note that it corresponds to the ~cairo2~ package in opam, which does
*not* depend on lablgtk!
(the downside being, I think, that the API provided by the cairo ( C) library is very imperative and
can be a bit tricky to use at times).

I also know of the [vg](https://github.com/dbuenzli/vg) library for vector graphics, which has the
virtue of being pure ocaml code. It is also very well documented. I suspect that it has a smaller
feature set and number of supported backends than Cairo, but has a nicer API.
Actually, it seems that you can use Cairo as a backend for Vg
(https://erratique.ch/software/vg/doc/Vgr_cairo/index.html), which might give you the best of both
worlds, in the case where you want to use Vg with a backend only supported by Cairo.

      <cwn_who>Igarnier added</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
You an use e.g. ~Cairo.Image.create_for_data32~ to create a Cairo RGBA surface from a bigarray (that
can be then shared with Sdl or whatever other lib for displaying).
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Yoann Padioleau then replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Oh you're right. I just found this example to transfer pictures from cairo to graphics:
https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo/blob/master/examples/graphics_demo.ml
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Armael added</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Oh, and I should note that I know of a third option: https://github.com/let-def/wall

It also has a nice vector-graphics API, and can render to Tsdl (see [the
example](https://github.com/let-def/wall/blob/master/example/minimal.ml)).
(downside: it's maybe a bit less mature and less documented than the other two, but seems to correspond
to what you're looking for.)
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Florent Monnier said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
You can scale and rotate with SDL2 and it's bindings.
Use the function [Render.copyEx](https://fccm.github.io/OCamlSDL2/Sdlrender.html#VALcopyEx) to copy a
sprite on screen. Use the ~angle~ parameter to rotate and use rectangles of different ~width~ and
~height~ to scale.
SDL2 doesn't permit to draw much shapes though, only rectangles by default, because it's made for
gamedev, but you can use the ~SDL2_gfx~ lib in addition with SDL2, with its template bindings
[OCamlSDL2_Gfx](https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2_Gfx).
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Florent Monnier later added</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
SFML and its bindings [ocaml-sfml](https://github.com/fccm/ocaml-sfml) allow more shapes drawing than
SDL2.

You will probably be able to do everything you want with it, any shapes, rotate, scale, translate and
more!
Have a look at its [api-doc](http://fccm.github.io/ocaml-sfml/), and in particular the [SFShape
module](http://fccm.github.io/ocaml-sfml/SFShape.html).

(Also please notice that SDL and SDL2 are 2 different libs, that don’t share any code, and have 2
different licenses, and with different implementations, SDL 1.2 uses software render, and SDL2 uses
OpenGL inside.)

I have the pleasure to announce the to announce the first opam release of
[Snowflake](https://gitlab.com/boreal-ldd/snowflake) : a Generic Symbolic Dynamic Programming framework
interfacing WAP, RBTF and [MLBDD](https://github.com/arlencox/mlbdd).

#+begin_quote
Complex systems (either physical or logical) are usually structured and sparse, that is, they are
build from individual components linked together, and any component is only linked to a rather small
number of other components with respects to the size of the global system.

RBTF exploits this structure, by over-approximating the relations between components as a tree
(called decomposition tree in the graph literature) each node of this tree being a set of components
of the initial systems. Then, starting from leaves, each sub-system is solved and the solutions are
projected as a new constraints on their parent node, this process is iterated until all sub-systems
are solved. This step allows to condensate all constraints into a single sub-system and check their
satisfiability. We call this step the *Forward Reduction Process* (FRP).

Finally, we can propagate all the constraints back into their initial sub-system by performing those
same projection in the reverse direction. That is, each sub-system update its set of solution given
the information from its parent then send the information to its children sub-systems (possibly none,
if its a leaf). We call this step the *Backward Propagation Process* (BPP).

      <cwn_title>Using CLI arguments through modules and configuration files</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/using-cli-arguments-through-modules-and-configuration-files/6725/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>erhan gundogan asked</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I was looking for common approaches and best practises regarding to CLI argument passing and
configuration files. I couldn't find much after googling so here is my questions:

1. I am getting arguments with cmdliner library and passing those arguments through functions. And sometimes I have to pass these arguments through multiple functions. I am not sure if that's the correct way of doing it. Let's say I have ~verbose~ flag defined and I have logs in various modules. So how can I receive this flag whenever needed? Could you please share any resources regarding to saving arguments and accessing them from different modules?

2. Is there a configuration file concept in OCaml? Files such as ~.yaml~ and ~.json~
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Craig Ferguson replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
For the specific case of logging, my advice is to use the [Logs](https://erratique.ch/software/logs)
library or – failing that – to just copy the approach that it takes verbatim. ~Logs~ looks after some
global mutable state that contains the current logging level of the program, so you don't have to
bother with propagating this information throughout your program. When I'm reading OCaml code, I'm not
concerned with whether any particular function might emit log lines, so I don't need this to be made
painfully obvious at each call-site. If you do use ~Logs~, it comes pre-packaged with Cmdliner
specifications for setting the logging level in the ~logs.cli~ package (example
[here](https://github.com/CraigFe/oskel/blob/master/bin/main.ml#L187-L193)).

Generally, there are several options for propagating state throughout an OCaml program. In roughly
decreasing order of explicitness:
- pass all params explicitly to the functions that need them, precisely as you're doing right now.

- pack params into a "context" record (or object) that is passed explicitly where it's needed. (c.f. Dune's [~Context~](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/blob/master/src/dune_rules/context.mli#L46) and [~Super_context~](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/blob/master/src/dune_rules/super_context.ml#L187).)

- pack params into a "context" module that is then used to instantiate functors elsewhere in your program. (c.f. [~Ppxlib.Ast_builder~](https://ocaml-ppx.github.io/ppxlib/ppxlib/Ppxlib/Ast_builder/index.html) as a way of propagating a ~~loc~ flag everywhere.)

- use global mutable state, as in ~Logs~.

I've seen all four of these used sensibly in OCaml programs; the best one will depend on your
particular application requirements / how much you care about tracking which part of the program use
which arguments.

Regarding your second point, AFAIK there's no generic library for managing config files in OCaml (i.e.
what [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) provides for NPM). Every OCaml library
that I've seen that uses one tends to roll their own logic for it. You could of course use Yojson or
OCaml-Yaml to read a file in one of those formats, but you'll end up managing the details yourself. The
lightweight approach is to use environment variables, since Cmdliner will handle that boilerplate for
you; managing config files is a pain, particularly w.r.t. things like respecting ~XDG_CONFIG~ and it's
analogues on Windows.

      <cwn_who>Xavier Leroy also replied</cwn_who>

Re: configuration files, there are a few libraries in OPAM:

- http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocplib-config/
- http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ez_config/

      <cwn_who>Josh Berdine said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
If you want to use globals with cmdliner, you might find it convenient to use some code such as:
#+begin_src ocaml
(** Extension of Cmdliner supporting lighter-weight option definition *)
module Cmdliner : sig
  include module type of Cmdliner

  val mk : default:'a -> 'a Term.t -> 'a ref
  (** [mk ~default term] is a ref which, after [parse] is called, contains
      the value of the command line option specified by [term]. *)

  val parse : Term.info -> (unit -> unit Term.ret) -> unit
  (** [parse info validate] parses the command line according to the options
      declared by calls to [mk], using manual and version [info], and
      calling [validate] to check usage constraints not expressible in the
      [Term] language. *)
end = struct
  include Cmdliner

  (** existential package of a Term and a setter for a ref to receive the
      parsed value *)
  type arg = Arg : 'a Term.t * ('a -> unit) -> arg

  (** convert a list of arg packages to a term for the tuple of all the arg
      terms, and apply it to a function that sets all the receiver refs *)
  let tuple args =
    let pair (Arg (trm_x, set_x)) (Arg (trm_y, set_y)) =
      let trm_xy = Term.(const (fun a b -> (a, b)) $ trm_x $ trm_y) in
      let set_xy (a, b) = set_x a ; set_y b in
      Arg (trm_xy, set_xy)
    in
    let init = Arg (Term.const (), fun () -> ()) in
    let (Arg (trm, set)) = List.fold_right ~f:pair args ~init in
    Term.app (Term.const set) trm

  let args : arg list ref = ref []

  let mk ~default arg =
    let var = ref default in
    let set x = var := x in
    args := Arg (arg, set) :: !args ;
    var

  let parse info validate =
    match Term.eval (Term.(ret (const validate $ tuple !args)), info) with
    | `Ok () -> ()
    | `Error _ -> Caml.exit 1

      <cwn_title>Multicore OCaml: October 2020</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-october-2020/6729/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Anil Madhavapeddy announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Welcome to the October 2020 multicore OCaml report, compiled by @shakthimaan, @kayceesrk and of course
myself. The [previous monthly](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly) updates are also
available for your perusal.

*OCaml 4.12.0-dev:* The upstream OCaml tree has been branched for the 4.12 release, and the [OCaml
readiness team](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/17530) is busy stabilising it with the
ecosystem. The 4.12.0 development stream has significant progress towards multicore support, especially
with the runtime handling of naked pointers. The release will ship with a dynamic checker for naked
pointers that you can use to verify that your own codebase is clean of them, as this will be a
prerequisite for OCaml 5.0 and multicore compatibility. This is activated via the
~--enable-naked-pointers-checker~ configure option.

*Convergence with upstream and multicore trees:* The multicore OCaml trees have seen significant
robustness improvements as we've converged our trees with upstream OCaml (possible now that the
upstream architectural changes are synched with the requirements of multicore). In particular, the
handling of global C roots is much better in multicore now as it uses the upstream OCaml scheme, and
the GC colour scheme also exactly matches upstream OCaml's.  This means that community libraries from
~opam~ work increasingly well when built with multicore OCaml (using the ~no-effects-syntax~ branch).

*Features:* Multicore OCaml is also using domain local allocation buffers now to simplify its
internals.  We are also now working on benchmarking the IO subsystem, and support for CPU parallelism
for the Lwt concurrency library has been added, as well as refreshing the new Asynchronous Effect-based
IO ([aeio](https://github.com/kayceesrk/ocaml-aeio)) with Multicore OCaml, Lwt, and httpaf in an
[http-effects](https://github.com/sadiqj/http-effects) library.

*Benchmarking:* The Sandmark benchmarking test suite has additional configuration options, and there
are new proposals in that project to leverage as much of the OCaml tools and ecosystem as much as
possible.

As with previous updates, the Multicore OCaml ongoing, and completed tasks are listed first, which are
followed by improvements to the Sandmark benchmarking test suite. Finally, the upstream OCaml related
work is mentioned for your reference.

*** Multicore OCaml

**** Ongoing

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#422](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/422)
  Simplify minor heaps configuration logic and masking

  The PR is a step towards using Domain local allocation buffers. A
  ~Minor_heap_max~ size is used to reserve the minor heaps area, and
  ~Is_young~ for relying on a boundary check. The ~Minor_heap_max~ can
  be overridden using OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#426](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/426)
  Replace global roots implementation

  An effort to replace the existing global roots implementation to be
  in line with OCaml's ~globroots~. The objective is to also have a
  per-domain skip list, and a global orphans when a domain is
  terminated.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multiore#427](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/427)
  Garbage Collector colours change backport

  The [Garbage Collector colour scheme
  changes](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9756) in the major
  collector have now been backported to Multicore OCaml. The
  ~mark_entry~ does not include ~end~, ~mark_stack_push~ resembles
  closer to trunk, and ~caml_shrink_mark_stack~ has been adapted from
  trunk.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#429](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/429)
  Fix a STW interrupt race

  The STW interrupt race in
  ~caml_try_run_on_all_domains_with_spin_work~ is fixed in this PR,
  where the ~enter_spin_callback~ and ~enter_spin_data~ fields of
  ~stw_request~ are initialized after we interrupt other domains.

**** Completed

***** Systhreads support

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#381](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381)
  Reimplementing Systhreads with pthreads (Domain execution contexts)

  The re-implementation of Systhreads with pthreads has been completed
  for Multicore OCaml. The Domain Execution Context (DEC) is
  introduced which allows multiple threads to run atop a domain.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#410](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/410)
  systhreads: ~caml_c_thread_register~ and ~caml_c_thread_unregister~

  The ~caml_c_thread_register~ and ~caml_c_thread_unregister~
  functions have been reimported to systhreads. In Multicore OCaml,
  threads created by C code will be registered to domain 0 threads
  chaining.

***** Domain Local Storage

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#404](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/404)
  Domain.DLS.new_key takes an initialiser

  The ~Domain.DLS.new_key~ now accepts an initialiser argument to
  assign an associated value to a key, if not initialised
  already. Also, ~Domain.DLS.get~ no longer returns an option value.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#405](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/405)
  Rework Domain.DLS.get search function such that it no longer allocates

  The ~Domain.DLS.get~ has been updated to remove any memory
  allocation, if the key already exists in the domain local
  storage. The PR also changes the ~search~ function to accept all
  inputs as variables, instead of a closure from the environment.

***** Lwt

- [ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam#33](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam/pull/33)
  Add lwt.5.3.0+multicore

  The Lwt.5.3.0 concurrency library has been added to support CPU
  parallelism with Multicore OCaml. A [blog
  post](https://sudha247.github.io/2020/10/01/lwt-multicore/)
  introducing its installation and usage has been written by Sudha
  Parimala.

- The [Asynchronous Effect-based IO](https://github.com/kayceesrk/ocaml-aeio) builds with a recent
  Lwt, and the HTTP effects demo has been updated to work with
  Multicore OCaml, Lwt, and httpaf. The demo source code is available
  at the [http-effects](https://github.com/sadiqj/http-effects) repo.

***** Sundries

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#406](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/406)
  Remove ephemeron usage of RPC

  The inter-domain mechanism is not required with the stop-the-world
  minor GC, and hence the same has been removed in the ephemeron
  implementation. The PR also does clean up and simplifies the
  ephemeron data structure and code.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#411](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/411)
  Fix typo for presume and presume_arg in ~internal_variable_names~

  A minor typo bug fix to rename ~Presume~ and ~Presume_arg~ in
  ~internal_variables_names.ml~.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#414](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/414)
  Fix up ~Ppoll~ ~semantics_of_primitives~ entry

  The ~semantics_of_primitives~ entry for ~Ppoll~ has been fixed which
  was causing flambda builds to remove poll points.

- [ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#416](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/416)
  Fix callback effect bug

  The PR fixes a bug when the C-to-OCaml callback prevents effects
  crossing a C callback boundary. The stack parent is cleared before a
  callback, and restored afterwards. It also makes the stack parent a
  local root, so that the GC can see it inside the callback.

*** Benchmarking

**** Ongoing

***** Configuration

- [ocaml-bench/ocaml-bench-scripts#12](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/ocaml_bench_scripts/pull/12)
  Add support for parallel multibench targets and JSON input

  The ~RUN_CONFIG_JSON~ and ~BUILD_BENCH_TARGET~ variables are now
  added and passed during run-time for the execution of parallel
  benchmarks. Default values are specified so that the serial
  benchmarks can still run without explicitly requiring the same.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#180](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/180)
  Notebook Refactoring and User changes

  A refactoring effort is underway to make the parallel benchmark
  interactive. The user accounts on The Littlest JupyterHub
  installation have direct access to the benchmark results produced
  from ~ocaml-bench-scripts~ on the system.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#189](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/189)
  Add environment support for wrapper in JSON configuration file

  The OCAMLRUNPARAM is now passed as an environment variable to the
  benchmarks during runtime, so that, different parameter values can
  be used to obtain multiple results for comparison. The use case and
  the discussion are available at [Running benchmarks with varying
  OCAMLRUNPARAM](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/184)
  issue. The environment variables can be specified in the
  ~run_config.json~ file, as shown below:

  #+begin_src json
   {
      "name": "orun_2M",
      "environment": "OCAMLRUNPARAM='s=2M'",
      "command": "orun -o %{output} -- taskset --cpu-list 5 %{command}"
    }
  #+end_src

***** Proposals

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#159](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/159)
  Implement a better way to describe tasklet cpulist

  The discussion to implement a better way to obtain the taskset list
  of cores for a benchmark run is still in progress. This is required
  to be able to specify hyper-threaded cores, NUMA zones, and the
  specific cores to use for the parallel benchmarks.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#179](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/179)
  [RFC] Classifying benchmarks based on running time

  A proposal to categorize the benchmarks based on their running time
  has been provided. The following classification types have been
  suggested:
  - ~lt_1s~: Benchmarks that run for less than 1 second.
  - ~lt_10s~: Benchmarks that run for at least 1 second, but, less than 10 seconds.
  - ~10s_100s~: Benchmarks that run for at least 10 seconds, but, less than 100 seconds.
  - ~gt_100s~: Benchmarks that run for at least 100 seconds.

  The PR for the same is available at [Classification of
  benchmarks](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/188).

- We are exploring the use of ~opam-compiler~ switch environment to
  build the Sandmark benchmark test suite. The merge of [systhreads
  compatibility
  support](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/407)
  now enables us to install dune natively inside the switch
  environment, along with the other benchmarks. With this approach, we
  hope to modularize our benchmarking test suite, and converge to
  fully using the OCaml tools and ecosystem.

  Lock-free map bench

  An implementation of a concurrent hash-array mapped trie that is
  lock-free, and is based on Prokopec, A. et. al. (2011). This
  cache-aware implementation benchmark is currently under review.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#183](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/183)
  Use crout_decomposition name for numerical analysis benchmark

  A couple of LU decomposition benchmarks exist in the Sandmark
  repository, and this PR renames the
  ~numerical-analysis/lu_decomposition.ml~ benchmark to
  ~crout_decomposition.ml~. This is to address [Rename
  lu_decomposition benchmark in
  numerical-analysis](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/issues/182)
  any naming confusion between the two benchmarks, as their
  implementations are different.

  The ~multicore-minilight~ and ~multicore-numerical~ benchmarks have
  now been updated to use the new Domain.DLS API with initializer.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#185](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/185)
  Clean up existing effect benchmarks

  The PR ensures that the code compiles without any warnings, and adds
  a ~multicore_effects_run_config.json~ configuration file, and a
  ~run_all_effect.sh~ script to execute the same.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#186](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/186)
  Very simple effect microbenchmarks to cover code paths

  A set of four microbenchmarks to test the throughput of our effects
  system have now been added to the Sandmark test suite. These include
  ~effect_throughput_clone~, ~effect_throughput_val~,
  ~effect_throughput_perform~, and ~effect_throughput_perform_drop~.

- [ocaml-bench/sandmark#187](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/187)
  Implementation of 'recursion' benchmarks for effects

  A collection of recursion benchmarks to measure the overhead of
  effects are now included to Sandmark. This is inspired by the
  (Manticore
  benchmarks)[https://github.com/ManticoreProject/benchmark/].

*** OCaml

**** Ongoing

- [ocaml/ocaml#9876](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9876)
  Do not cache young_limit in a processor register

  The PR removes the caching of ~young_limit~ in a register for ARM64,
  PowerPC and RISC-V ports. The Sandmark benchmarks are presently
  being tested on the respective hardware.

- [ocaml/ocaml#9934](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9934)
  Prefetching optimisations for sweeping

  The Sandmark benchmarking tests were performed for analysing a
  couple of patches that optimise ~sweep_slice~, and for the use of
  prefetching. The objective is to reduce cache misses during GC.

**** Completed

- [ocaml/ocaml#9947](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9947)
  Add a naked pointers dynamic checker

  The check for "naked pointers" (dangerous out-of-heap pointers) is
  now done in run-time, and tests for the three modes: naked pointers,
  naked pointers and dynamic checker, and no naked pointers have been
  added in the PR.

- [ocaml/ocaml#9951](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9951/)
  Ensure that the mark stack push optimisation handles naked pointers

  The PR adds a precise check on whether to push an object into the
  mark stack, to handle naked pointers.

We would like to thank all the OCaml users and developers in the community for their continued support,
reviews and contribution to the project.
