What is mod_caml?

mod_caml is a set of Objective CAML (OCaml) bindings for the Apache
API. It allows you to run CGI scripts written in OCaml directly inside
the Apache webserver. However, it is much much more than just that:

    * Bind to any part of the Apache request cycle.
    * Read and modify internal Apache structures.
    * Share modules of code between handlers and scripts.
    * CGI library and templating system (allows separation of code and
      presentation).
    * Works with Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0.
    * DBI library for simple database access.
    * DBI library can use Perl DBDs (database drivers) [requires
      Perl4Caml &gt;= 0.3.6]
