We have the pleasure of announcing the release of OCaml version
4.02.1. This is all about speed: not only this release fixes a large
slowdown in the compiler, but today is also the anniversary of the
first time a man broke the sound barrier with an airplane.

This is mainly a bug-fix release, see the list of changes below.

It is available here: &lt; <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html">http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html</a> &gt;

This is released as source on our web site, but the OPAM switch will
be available very soon (in a few minutes).

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.

I am pleased to announce "uproplib", a library which provides access
to Unicode Character Database (UCD).

<a href="https://github.com/yoriyuki/uproplib/releases/tag/v0.0.1">https://github.com/yoriyuki/uproplib/releases/tag/v0.0.1</a>

UCD is compiled into the binary of the library itself, so, unlike
camomile,  you do not need to specify the location of data files.  The
size of the library is about 3M bytes on my Mac, but since each
property is packaged as a separate module, you only need to link the
properties which you need.  uproplib contains all UCD properties
except Unihan properties.

To compile uproplib, you need ucorelib and Daniel Bünzli 's uucd, in
addition to standard ocaml and Unix tools.

This is very early alpha release.  There is no documentation, no opam
package, and even no test :-)

a new minor version has been released. There is a new ppxopt META
variable allowing to pass options to ppx rewriters (for toploop use,
ocaml-4.02.1 is required). This variable allows to set options for
required ppx packages (e.g. ppxopt="pkg1,foo pkg2,bar" passes option foo
to the ppx rewriter in package pkg1, and bar to the ppx rewriter defined
in pkg2).

Also, a new environment variable FINDLIB_TOOLCHAIN was added. Both
changes were developed by Peter Zotov (thanks for this).

In 1994, Barton and Nackman in their book 'Scientific Engineering in
C++' [1] demonstrated how one could encode the rules of Dimensional
Analysis [2] into the C++ type system enabling compile-time checking
(no runtime-cost) of the plausibility (at least up to the dimensional
correctness) of computations.

In 2004, Abrahams &amp; Gurtovy in 'C++ Template Metaprogramming' [3]
showed the Barton Nackman technique to be elegantly implementable
using compile time type sequences encoding integer constants. At the
end of this post, I provide a complete listing of their example
program [4].

The key properties of the system (as I see it) are:
- Encoding of integers as types; 
- Compile time manipulation of sequences of these integer encodings
to deduce/produce new derived types.

Now, it is not immediately obvious to me how to approach this problem
in OCaml. It irks me some that I can't immediately produce a yet more
elegant OCaml program for this problem and leaves me feeling like C++
has "got something over on us" here ;)

My question therefore is: Does anyone have suggestions/pointers
on how to approach automatic dimensional analysis via the OCaml type
system? 

Best,

I'm glad to announce opam-android, a cross-toolchain for Android
based on OCaml 4.02.1. The goals of this port was to minimize
the changes to the OCaml compiler, to simplify porting packages
as much as possible, to support compile-time components like
ppx rewriters or cstubs, and to make using it as simple as possible.

I believe I have achieved these goals. In particular, I want
to highlight that both bytecode and native code compiling works,
-output-obj works and can be used to emit .o and .so files,
and using the toolchain is as simple as passing -toolchain android
to your ocamlfind invocation (or even setting the OCAMLFIND_TOOLCHAIN
environment variable).

OCaml 4.02 has new facilities for installing a new backtrace handler,
and processing the back trace symbolically. As a little proof of
concept, I've built a package which you can add to any project to get
backtrace with source code printed and highlighted:

<a href="https://github.com/johnwhitington/exn-source">https://github.com/johnwhitington/exn-source</a>

Here's the start of a backtrace:

<a href="http://www.coherentpdf.com/exnsource.png">http://www.coherentpdf.com/exnsource.png</a>

By default, it prints five lines either side, and looks the current
directory for source code. But as one can see from the screenshot, one
can add /usr/local/lib/ocaml to get stdlib source and so on...

It's somewhat difficult to test this kind of thing (we can't use
exceptions at all inside a backtrace handler, for example), so I'm
appealing for help. Attach exn-source to your code and let me know how
you get on...
      </pre><i>Gabriel Scherer replied:</i><br /><pre>
That looks like a nice project ! Another trick I use personally is to
run the faulting program from inside Emacs's compile-mode (using
"build &amp;&amp; run" instead of just "build" as a compilatoin command), and
piggy-back on its parsing of OCaml error locations to ask Emacs to
drive me around the relevant files.
I'm sure there are scenarios where your simultaneous view of all
fragments at once can be very helpful, and I'm also interested in the
uses of the new backtrace/callstack inspection API.

&gt; (we can't use exceptions at all inside a backtrace handler, for
&gt; example)

I'm a bit surprised by this. Part of the point of reifying traces into
datatypes (raw_backtrace, backtrace_slot) was to make them persistent.
set_uncaught_exception_handler is passed a raw trace that should not
be mutated by raising new exceptions. What breaks if you use
exceptions inside a backtrace handler?
      </pre><i>John Whitington then said:</i><br /><pre>
To quote the documentation for set_uncaught_exception_handler: "If fn
raises an exception, it is ignored."

This is a bit ambiguous -- it might mean

a) The uncaught exception handler you register won't get called from
inside itself in the case of an uncaught exception. Nor will any such
exceptions be handled by the standard exception handler; or

b) Exceptions in the handler literally have no effect.

I've done a little test just now, and it seems to be (a), so perhaps
it's just in need of clarification in the documentation.

(It might be nice to have, for development, an option to have the
default exception handler remain active, so it reports any exceptions
escaping from the user-installed exception handler).        
      </pre><i>Peter Zotov commented and John Whitington replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Very nice project! However, it looks like the user needs to explicitly
&gt; specify the paths to the sources. I have some code to perform a similar

Yes, except for '.' which is hardcoded. So, in the simplest case, it works.

&gt; task[1]; the paths are actually contained inside the bytecode.
&gt; I think that for native-code you can fetch them in a similar way, though
&gt; it is a little harder to extract the debug info.

Noted. I'd like to add functionality like this. The first thing I'm
going to add is automatic finding of the stdlib, since this just
requires parsing the output of "ocamlc -config".

Unfortunately, I don't believe most OPAM packages install their
source, just the .mli files. I wonder how much extra space installing
source would take on average, and if people think it's worth it, for
this or other reasons.

I'd like to announce a new release of Slacko, the OCaml Slack API
binding. This is both an announcement as well as a request for comments
regarding the API.

The homepage is at <a href="https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/slacko">https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/slacko</a>, the
documentation can be read online at
<a href="https://leonidas-from-xiv.github.io/slacko/">https://leonidas-from-xiv.github.io/slacko/</a> and the tarball as well

recommended way is to install it from OPAM of course, which already
carries the 0.10.0 release.

I've listened to the suggestions by Malcolm, Gabriel and Jaques as well
as Drup so the methods are not longer "stringly" typed, each function
supports parameters that make more sense, like user/group/channel
types, booleans, integers etc. The results are changed from a huge
monolithic type to individual polymorphic variants composed of smaller
types.

But some questions remain: I have a number of types and conversion
functions (foo_of_string mostly). These can validate the input
(checking if the format is correct or whether the input is not too
long) and most likely should. But what is the preferred OCaml way of
handling failure to convert? I could use exceptions but that seems
kinda type unsafe to me. I could use option types, but that might make
for some clunky conversions. Any ideas?

Also there are errors like `Msg_too_long. I'm currently exposing them,
because the API might throw them. But when doing validation inside my
binding, these errors can't really happen, since I validated
beforehand. I think that these can be filtered out (since the length
limit is static and if it changes, the library can be updated), but if
anyone has a different perspective, please speak up.

Looking forwards to comments!

Oh and I ported from the Camlp4 Lwt macros to PPX. Was super easy and
worked like a charm, zero issues.

I am slightly puzzled by a type-error related to first class modules.
I am basically defining two types (see full example below)

```
type t = (module A)
type 'a s = (module A with type I.t = 'a)
```

and I expect a value of type `'a s` can be coerced to a value of type
t. However, this is obviously not the case because I get the following
error message, and I wonder why.

```
(* Error: This expression has type a s = (module A with type I.t = a) *)
(*        but an expression was expected of type t = (module A) *)

Is there a common pattern to deal with this situation? Any pointers appreciated.

Best,

(* Full example *)

module type IN = sig
  type t
  val of_string : string -&gt; t
  val to_string : t -&gt; string

let test1 : t -&gt; string = fun (module T) -&gt; T.v

Conversions between first class module types need explicit coercions.
It's sufficient to change your test4 function as follows:

&gt; let test4 (type a) : a s -&gt; string = fun t -&gt; test1 t

   let test4 (type a) : a s -&gt; string = fun t -&gt; test1 (t :&gt; (module A))
      </pre><i>He later added:</i><br /><pre>
 or you can, of course, use the alias 't' to coerce:

      let test4 (type a) : a s -&gt; string = fun t -&gt; test1 (t :&gt; t)

It is my pleasure to announce (for Damien Doligez ^_^) the release of
Zenon, an automatic theorem prover written in OCaml.

Zenon handles first-order logic with equality. Its most important
feature is that it outputs the proofs of the theorems, in
Coq-checkable form.

This is version 0.8.0, available at &lt; <a href="http://sosie.inria.fr">http://sosie.inria.fr</a> &gt; (and
soon at &lt; <a href="http://zenon-prover.org">http://zenon-prover.org</a> &gt;) with several issues fixed since
the last release.

Unfortunately, there is no documentation yet, so this is for the
adventurous spirit.

It is released under the New BSD license.
