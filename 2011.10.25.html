&gt; I have a slightly strange piece of re-tagging to do to some MP3s and was
&gt; having a quick look to see if there were any OCaml libraries/bindings for
&gt; reading and writing ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags.
&gt; 
&gt; A cursory glance revealed MP3tags on the hump but its dependencies seem to
&gt; be out of date and it wasn't clear that I'd be able to build it in a newer
&gt; ocaml because of camlp4 problems...
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone recommend a library?

You can give a try to mp3tag:

I just commited a compilation fix to use lablgtk-extras library[1]. You
must checkout the CVS trunk:

I have to write an interpreter for a datatype rich purely applicative
language. I have already written a naive interpreter (like in
programming languages class) and was wondering what where the options
for writing something that would perform better while keeping it
maintainable by a single person &lt; 5% dedicated and preferably only in
core-ML (no C code or fancy ML extensions).

The language could be described as a rich datastructure typed SQL with
a programming language syntax
- first class sets, arrays, dictionaries, lists and their
corresponding comprehensions
- tuples and records merged into a single concept (accessible per
position like in (x, y) = ... or per label like in for t in tupleSet
if t.label == 3 then)
- only applicative functions (no lambda operator, no partial
application)
- simple types are int, double and string
- only user declared types are tuples-records

It is mainly used for data transformation : take a list of countries,
extract from an database the international airports of those
countries, geolocalize them using city/location table, generate a
distance table using a great-circle distance, assign to each size of
plane the legs they can do based on their maximum fight range, etc.

The language has a _javascript_ inline capability

    execute _javascript_ { 
        //write your _javascript_ code here 
    }

that's typically used to define functions, unroll comprehensions to
make them more efficient and to call external libraries (_javascript_
has full visibility on all the language objects and can read/write
directly inside, probably the existing interpreter was written in
_javascript_), so I am considering allowing those features in the core
language and only supporting a very slow _javascript_ deprecated
compatibility mode.
      </pre><i>Gabriel Scherer suggested and Gerd Stolpmann added:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Even staying at the "interpreter" stage, you can probably improve your
&gt; performance seriously by being careful about your implementation : use
&gt; efficient data structure (what is your implementation of variable
&gt; lookup?), avoid unnecessary allocation, use tail-recursive functions
&gt; where possible, etc. Try to find a time-consuming script example that
&gt; exercise the type of computations you'll usually perform, and profile
&gt; your interpreter with gprof (compiled natively), try to optimize the
&gt; parts that show high in the profile, rinse and repeat.
&gt; 
&gt; The natural next step is to use a bytecode instead of interpreting an
&gt; AST directly. You can probably find something relatively simple and
&gt; yet have a net efficiency gain over direct interpretation, because the
&gt; bytecode structure is more linear and can be interpreted more
&gt; efficiently; in a way, you compiled away the tree traversal. 

Well, I wouldn't be too optimistic that this also works for an
interpreter written in Ocaml. Bytecode profits a lot from cache
locality, i.e. all bytecode instructions in a single cache line are
loaded at once from RAM. Cache lines are short, though, usually only 64
bytes. If the bytecode is an int array, this translates to 8 or 16 array
elements (64/32 bit platforms). If you stick to the int array, you
probably get the performance benefit, but you have to live with the
integer representation, which will make other parts of the interpreter
difficult (e.g. representation of values). If you use an instruction
array, where "instruction" is a variant type with and without arguments,
the performance benefit is probably completely lost, because you deviate
too much from the linear memory representation.

Also, anything in the direction of good bytecode is really complicated.
What about this alternative: It is much simpler to "JIT"-compile to
ocaml (i.e. dump your AST in a different syntax), compile the ocaml code
by invoking ocamlc or ocamlopt, and to load the compiled code
dynamically (I'm just guessing that you have a dynamic environment).
There are only a few drawbacks of this approach, namely that you need
ocamlc or ocamlopt at runtime (plus "helper files", i.e. the cmi's of
the standard library), and that you cannot delete code from RAM once it
is loaded. The latter is usually not too problematic if there is a
possibility to restart the system now and then.

Gerd

&gt; At this
&gt; level, you become quite sensible to micro-optimisation : bytecode
&gt; interpreters written in C have access to efficiency tricks (direct
&gt; threaded code and the like, or even pinning registers directly) that
&gt; are difficult or impossible to emulate in OCaml, even if you can get
&gt; something reasonable with mutually tail-recursive functions. As a
&gt; single point of measure, I spent a few hours hacking an OCaml bytecode
&gt; interpreter for a very small subset of Caml recently, and got within
&gt; 5x-10x slower than the OCaml bytecode interpreter itself for favorable
&gt; cases. It's not very good, or not very bad, depending on what you
&gt; expect (but definitely slower than the ocaml native compiler, or even
&gt; the various JIT projects).
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, if possible, you could also target an existing bytecode or
&gt; intermediate representation, or even compile to an existing language
&gt; with a rich enough runtime. If you're familiar, for example, with
&gt; either JVM or LLVM, those are the popular choices these days. I don't
&gt; know how that would mix with inline Javascript, though (I suppose both
&gt; environments have a javascript interpreter). You could also compile to
&gt; OCaml code or Javascript directly, and reuse their implementation, GC,
&gt; etc. With the current Javascript engines, you can get very good
&gt; performances if you compile in a way that resemble the ugly Javascript
&gt; code they're trying to optimize. For example, js_of_ocaml compiles
&gt; OCaml bytecode into Javascript and the result performs better than
&gt; using OCaml bytecode interpreter (written in C and well designed for
&gt; efficiency) directly. That's already quite a lot more work, however,
&gt; than a good interpreter or a simple home-made bytecode.

Gabriel and Gerd gave very good advice already, but here are my two
cents:

- Beware of premature optimizations.  It could very well be that your
  naive interpreter is already fast enough for your applications.
  Test and profile to find hot spots.

- Pay special attention to your data structures, e.g. environments should
  be maps, not A-lists.  A good trick is to hash-cons identifiers
  into unique integers: not only comparisons are much faster,
  but you can use Patricia trees for your environments.

- Compiling to bytecode is probably overkill.
      </pre><i>Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons then said and Jérémie Dimino replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; I was rather thinking of translating on-the-fly into Caml code and letting
&gt; Caml do the job. Is that technically possible (rewriting a toplevel ? a
&gt; CamlP4 grammar ?). If so guess I would have to license the Caml compiler
&gt; from the INRIA.

You can link with the toplevellib and use the Toploop module which
provides functions for executing an OCaml AST. To create the AST you can
for example write a parser for your language with Camlp4 and translate
it using the Camlp4_import module. Note that you still need to have
standard library cmi's at runtime. Also you can only compile your
interpreter in bytecode.
      </pre><i>Gerd Stolpmann also replied:</i><br /><pre>
I don't think you need that, because you can load compiled OCaml code
dynamically (look into the Dynlink library). This works with both
bytecode and native code (in recent OCaml versions). This way you just
invoke the compiler via the normal ocamlc or ocamlopt executable, and
you don't need to change the compiler (for which you would need the
license).

If you prefer to include the OCaml compiler directly into your
"interpreter", you probably get only a very small speedup when "loading"
code (the overhead of spawning a new process is small). This is IMO only
worth it if you load code very frequently.

About the CARP project: 

In recent years, massively parallel accelerator processors, primarily
GPUs, have become widely available to end-users. Accelerators offer
tremendous compute power at a low cost, and tasks such as media
processing, simulation, medical imaging and eye-tracking can be
accelerated to beat CPU performance by orders of
magnitude. Performance is gained in energy efficiency and execution
speed, allowing intensive media processing software to run in
low-power consumer devices.

Accelerators present a serious challenge for software developers. A
system may contain one or more of the plethora of accelerators on the
market, with many more products anticipated in the immediate
future. Applications must exhibit portable correctness, operating
correctly on any configuration of accelerators, and portable
performance, exploiting processing power and energy efficiency offered
by a wide range of devices.

The overall aims of CARP are to design techniques and tools for
correct and efficient accelerator programming:

- Novel &amp; attractive methods for constructing system-independent accelerator
programs 
- Advanced code generation techniques to produce highly optimised
 system-specific code from system-independent programs
- Scalable static techniques for analysing system-independent and
 system-specific accelerator programs, both qualitatively and
 quantitatively.
