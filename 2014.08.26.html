The release of OCaml version 4.02.0 is imminent.  We have
created a release candidate for your testing pleasure.  Please
download the sources, compile, install, and test your favourite
software with it.  Then let me know whether it works for you.

We want to know about any show-stopping bugs, especially in the
compilation and installation phases.

This release candidate is available as source code at this
address: <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.02/</a>

Happy hacking,

Following Damien's announcement of a new rc-candidate, I set out to
refresh the OCaml installer for windows and realized that I could use
some feedback.

The installer currently distributes:
- ocaml, with native and bytecode compilers
- flexlink
- findlib
- "ocamlwin", the infamous windows top-level,
- camlp4
- labltk

Please note that this is not enough to compile native programs, as an
external assembly tool ("as") is required, so without any extras, the
user can only use the top-level, and perform byte-code
compilation. Please note that, even though labltk is distributed,
run-time support libraries are needed for tk programs to run.

The installer currently:
- offers the option of installing cygwin along with enough packages to
have a working toolchain, including the "as" tool;
- offers the option of downloading and setting up emacs, along with
the official caml-mode, and setting up the right file associations (ml
and mli) in the windows explorer;
- offers the option of downloading activetcl to make sure tools such
as ocamlbrowser and the labltk libraries work properly.

I am considering:
- dropping "ocamlwin": it is old, buggy, and better replacements are
now available;
- optionally installing OCamlTop to provide a much-needed replacement
for "ocamlwin";
- dropping labltk along with the option for downloading activetcl:
this requires extra effort on my side because it now is distributed as
a separate project, and I suspect people who are serious about user
interfaces are using lablgtk, but I'd be interested in hearing your
opinion about this;
- keeping camlp4 even though it moved off into a separate project
- refreshing emacs to the latest version
- bundling Merlin binaries so that they can be installed along with
Emacs, if the user is so inclined.

I don't have a good understanding of the current user base of the
installer; so if you're a user of this installer, I'd be interested in
hearing your story. Is a good top-level important because you're in
education? Have you ever used labltk? Are you proficient enough to
download, say, odb (which, last time I checked, more or less worked on
Windows), and install the missing packages yourself?

Consider the signature LOGGER below, to be implemented by any module that
supposedly logs something wrapped under a custom monad:

  module type LOGGER =
  sig
      module Monad:
      sig
          type 'a t
          val return: 'a -&gt; 'a t
          val bind: 'a t -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b t) -&gt; 'b t
      end

      val log: unit -&gt; unit Monad.t
  end


We now define a functor that takes a LOGGER and defines a 'process' function
that operates under the monad.  But here's the twist: suppose that the function
that actually does the processing is defined elsewhere, in a module 'Foo'.
Moreover, instead of passing it the functions of the logger as independent
parameters, we deem it more convenient to pass the logger as a first-class
module:

  module Make (Logger: LOGGER) =
  struct
      let process x = Foo.actually_process (module Logger: LOGGER) x
  end


To avoid type-escaping-its-scope errors, we need to define a locally abstract
type in the implementation of 'actually_process'.  Something like this:

  let actually_process (type u) (module Logger: LOGGER with type 'a Monad.t = 'a u) x =
      let open Logger in
      let (&gt;&gt;=) t f = Monad.bind t f in
      Logger.log () &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
      Monad.return x


Which does not actually compile.  Is it at all possible to use a locally
abstract type when that type has type parameters?  And is there a solution
to this problem that does not require a) moving the implementation of
'actually_process' to the inside of a functor, or b) pass each function
of the first-class module as a separate parameter to 'actually_process'?
      </pre><i>John F. Carr replied:</i><br /><pre>
I hit the same limitation last year:

<a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-04/msg00159.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-04/msg00159.html</a>

The inability to constrain parameterized types in packed module
types is a documented restriction.  You will have to ask the type
theory experts whether it is a necessary restriction.

A followup message offered a workaround for some cases.

<a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-04/msg00160.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-04/msg00160.html</a>
      </pre><i>Benjamin Greenman then added:</i><br /><pre>
I agree with the solution in the second link: if you want a certain
condition to hold on the parameter, it needs to be made explicit. As
for whether this restriction is necessary, I believe it is because I
don't see any way of deciding the question 'a Monad.t = 'a u without
examining the abstract type hidden in a particular Logger.

What if you made LOGGER a functor parameterized on a Monad?
      </pre><i>Leo White replied to the original post:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; To avoid type-escaping-its-scope errors, we need to define a locally abstract
&gt; type in the implementation of 'actually_process'. Something like this:
&gt;
&gt;   let actually_process (type u) (module Logger: LOGGER with type 'a Monad.t = 'a u) x =
&gt;       let open Logger in
&gt;       let (&gt;&gt;=) t f = Monad.bind t f in
&gt;       Logger.log () &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
&gt;       Monad.return x
&gt;

This function relies on higher-kinded polymorphism (i.e. it is
polymorphic in type `u` which has type parameters). Since OCaml's core
language does not provide direct support for higher-kinded polymorphism
the usual solution is to make `actually_process` into a functor. A
possible alternative solution, which may suit your use case, is outlined
in the paper "Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism" [1] using the
"higher" library available on OPAM.

Leo

I did an evaluation of HTML parsers back in February. Most of the
options are XML parsers, and a lot of them are very old. Other than
Nethtml, I came up with two alternatives to consider:

<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/xmlm">http://erratique.ch/software/xmlm</a>
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/pfff/tree/master/lang_html">https://github.com/facebook/pfff/tree/master/lang_html</a>

I didn't end up spending much time on either. It quickly became clear
that Nethtml was what I needed. It handles content that isn't strictly
valid, which was important to me, and has good performance.

The changelog for all Core packages across all versions can be found at:

  <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/CHANGES.md">https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/CHANGES.md</a>

Here is the list of changes for this version:

## 111.28.00

### async_extra

- Added to `Versioned_rpc` a non-functor interface.
- Added `Log.level`, which returns the last level passed to `set_level`.
- Enabled Async-RPC pushback in the `Tcp_file` protocol.

### async_unix

- Added `Shutdown.set_default_force`, which allows one to change the
  default `force` value used by `shutdown`.

    This is useful for applications that call `shutdown` indirectly.

        val set_default_force : (unit -&gt; unit Deferred.t) -&gt; unit

### core

- Added `Piecewise_linear.create_from_linear_combination`.

        val create_from_linear_combination : (t * float) list -&gt; t Or_error.t

- Added `Time.is_{earlier,later} : Time.t -&gt; than:Time.t -&gt; bool`, which
  are easier to read than `Time.(&lt;)` and friends.
- Added `Command.exec`, which allows one to include the `Command`
  hierarchy from one executable in another.

    `Command.exec` takes the file path to an executable that uses the
    `Command` module and returns a `Command.t` that integrates the
    executable (by exec'ing it), including providing recursive help and
    autocompletion as if it were a standard `Command.t`.

- Replaced most uses of `Hashtbl.replace` with `Hashtbl.set`.
- Renamed `Float.epsilon` to `robust_comparison_tolerance`, to avoid
  confusion with `epsilon_float`.

### core_extended

- Implemented `Int.gcd` using binary GCD in C, for improved performance.
- Added `Bin_io_utils.Serialized`, which stores a value in memory as its
  bin-io representation.

    Writing such a value just blits the value.
- Moved `Text_block` from `Core_extended` into `Textutils`.
- Added modules `Hashtbl2` and `Hashtbl2_pair`.

### core_kernel

- Added `Pooled_hashtbl.resize` function, to allow preallocating a table
  of the desired size, to avoid growth at an undesirable time.
- Added `Pooled_hashtbl.on_grow` callback, to get information about
  hashtbl growth.
- Changed `Hashable.Make` to not export a `Hashable` module.

    The `Hashable` module previously exported was useless, and shadowed
    `Core.Std.Hashable`.

- Moved `Common.does_raise` to `Exn.does_raise`, to make it easier to
  find.
- Added `Float.one`, `minus_one`, and `~-`.  (fixes #12).
- Removed `Core.Std.unimplemented` and renamed it as
  `Or_error.unimplemented`.

    It is not used enough to live in the global namespace.

### jenga

- Fixed problem that caused `rule failed to generate targets`.

### ocaml_plugin

- Fixed a bug in tests that could leave the repository in a state where
  running the tests would fail.

    The bug happened if the tests were interrupted after creating
    read-only directories but before cleaning then up.

### pa_ounit

- Added a flag to disable embedding of unit tests/inline benchmarks.
  (`janestreet/core_kernel#13`)

### textutils

- Moved `Text_block` from `Core_extended` into `Textutils`.

----

We hope you find it useful!
