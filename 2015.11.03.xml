Merlin is an editor-independent tool to ease the developement of programs in
OCaml. It aims at providing features available in modern IDEs such as: "as you
type" error reporting, auto completion, source browsing ("jump to
definition"), extraction of type, ...

Merlin is available on opam and can be installed with `opam install merlin`.
It can also be built from sources, which are available at
https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin .

As always you can find a full changelog at
https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/CHANGELOG , but the
highlights are :

- Improvement in the handling of PPX syntax extensions.

- The Jump command contributed by Tomasz Kołodziejski for syntax-aware
navigation:
https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/Jump-command

- Support for MetaOCaml via the "meta" extension.

- Cleanup and refactoring of the Emacs mode to fix long standing issues with
concurrency.

And more generally a lot of bugfixes and improvement to the existing features.

We want to thank Rudi Grinberg, @Fourchaux, Christopher Reichert, David
Allsopp, Nick Borden, Mario Rodas, @Twinside, Pierre Chambart, Philipp
Haselwarter, Tomasz Kołodziejski and Syohei Yoshida who all contributed to
this release.
We also thank JaneStreet for their continued support.

      <cwn_title>New release of Menhir (20151030)</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2015-10/msg00211.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>François Pottier announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
A new release of Menhir (20151030) is available via opam (just run "opam
update" and "opam install menhir") and from
http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/ .

The relevant chunk of the CHANGES file is appended at the end of this message.
Here is a summary of the most important changes:

  - A brand new set of tools to work on syntax errors. These tools have been
    used to equip the CompCert compiler with new syntax error messages.

  - Additions to the incremental API, including several ready-made main loops.

  - Incompatible change of the incremental API: renamed the type ['a result]
    to ['a checkpoint] (sorry about that).

  - Makefile fixes in an attempt to allow installation under opam/Windows.

  - MenhirLib is now installed in both binary and source forms.
    This can be used to include a snapshot of MenhirLib in your project.
