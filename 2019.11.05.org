** Rudi Grinberg announced


Dear Vim & Neovim users,

I would like to announce that I've officially moved the [[https://github.com/ocaml/vim-ocaml][vim-ocaml]] repository under the control of the OCaml organization on github. Please direct your bug reports and pull requests to this repository. This move is done not because vim-ocaml is being neglected, on the contrary, there's an active team of maintainers that recently expanded. I simply want to take this opportunity to draw more Vim & Noevim users to this project, as I suspect many users aren't aware of recent efforts.
