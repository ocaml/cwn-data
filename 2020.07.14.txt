OCaml 4.11.0, second beta release

octachron announced
───────────────────

  The release of OCaml 4.11.0 is approaching.  As one step further in
  this direction, we have published a second beta release. This new
  release fixes an MSVC-specific runtime issue.

  The compatibility of the opam ecosystem with OCaml 4.11.0 is currently
  quite good with only 7 packages not currently available, and it should
  be possible to test this beta without too much trouble.

  The source code is available at these addresses:

  [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0+beta2.tar.gz]
  [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.11/ocaml-4.11.0+beta2.tar.gz]

  The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
  following commands:
  ┌────
  │ opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta2 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
  └────
  or
  ┌────
  │ opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta2+<VARIANT> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
  └────

  where you replace <VARIANT> with one of these: afl, flambda, fp,
  fp+flambda

  We would love to hear about any bugs. Please report them here:
   [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues]

  If you are interested by the list of new features, and the on-going
  list of bug fixes the updated change log for OCaml 4.11.0 is available
  at:

  [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/4.11/Changes]

  Compared to the previous beta release, the exhaustive list of changes
  is as follows:


Runtime
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • [#9714], [#9724]: Use the C++ alignas keyword when compiling in
    C++. Fixes a bug with MSVC C++ 2015/2017. Add a terminator to the
    `caml_domain_state' structure to better ensure that members are
    correctly spaced. (Antonin Décimo, review by David Allsopp and
    Xavier Leroy)

Manual and documentation
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • [#8644]: fix formatting comment about @raise in stdlib's mli files
    (Élie Brami, review by David Allsopp)

  • [#9712]: Update the version format to allow "`". The new format is
    "major.minor[.patchlevel][(+|')additional-info]", for instance
    "4.12.0~beta1+flambda". This is a documentation-only change for the
    4.11 branch, the new format will be used starting with the 4.12
    branch. (Florian Angeletti, review by Damien Doligez and Xavier
    Leroy)

letters - simple client abstractions for sending emails over SMTP

Miko announced

  Earlier today I've published the first release of [letters]. This
  library aims to provide simple to use client library for sending
  emails over SMTP using _lwt_ for async execution.

  It is build on top of _mrmime_ and _colombe_. While these libraries
  are very capable, they aren't that simple to use, _letters_ is trying
  to fill that gap. Anyway, big thanks for the authors of these projects
  for doing the heavy lifting.

  As this library is still in its early stage, I believe I will break
  the API with first few releases.  Luckily the API is quite simple so
  following these changes should be quite easy.

  To make this library awesome, any feedback or feature request is
  welcome. I'll try to address them as quickly as I can.

  I hope I've managed to scratch someone else's itch too, enjoy.

  I'm pleased to announce the release of [Alcotest] 1.2.0, now available
  on Opam.

  This release includes:
  • a new `alcotest-mirage' package for running tests on MirageOS;
  • full UTF-8 support;
  • default coloured output in Dune (without needing to pass
    `--no-buffer');
  • an improved output format.

  The full changelog is available [here].

Set up OCaml 1.1.0
══════════════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-set-up-ocaml-1-1-0/6093/1]


Sora Morimoto announced
───────────────────────

  This release contains these changes:

  • The default opam repository can now be set via input.
  • Linux VMs now use opam 2.0.7.

  [https://github.com/avsm/setup-ocaml/releases/tag/v1.1.0]


Sora Morimoto then added
────────────────────────

  In fact, this release was a long time ago, but I completely forgot to
  post this. By the way, we have made significant improvements to some
  of the documentation. In particular, the action versioning section is
  applicable to other GitHub Actions and definitely worth reading!
