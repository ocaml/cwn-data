There is still a security issue not fixed in this release which concerns
TIFF images. A CVE has been announced a while ago:
       http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3296

I tried to contact the authors (one month ago) but received no answer
yet. That's why I'm sending this message on the list: to let users and
packagers know about the bug.

The vulenarable file is “src/tiffread.c”. The patch is available at:

       http://tinyurl.com/cve-tiff-1

and the source code of “oversized.h” is available at:

       http://tinyurl.com/cve-tiff-2

These changes are applied in the Debian packages and were backported to
the stable and oldstable releases.
