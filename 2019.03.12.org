** RJ asked


Is anyone interested in using the Matrix protocol as a form of communication via Riot.im? Its bridge functionality, reasonably well-designed GUI, and powerful encryption tools could potentially attract some exposure to the language; I am a big fan of it. There are official pages for Arch, F Droid, Haskell, etc. on it currently - among others. It seems to be more reliable on-the-go than tools like email, the discuss pages, etc.
      

** Jim Tittsler replied


I monitor the #ocaml IRC channel using the Riot client thanks to
the IRC bridge.  This makes it easy to review activity during
periods when I am not online.\\

** Jeremie Dimino announced


I just wanted to bring your attention to the fact that the vmthreads
library is deprecated in the upcoming OCaml 4.08 release. This library
provides user-level threads for bytecode applications. We do not
believe this library is still actively used. Additionally, several
widely used alternatives exist, such as the Lwt [1] or Async [2]
libraries. As a result, we decided to deprecate and then delete it
from the compiler distribution in order to simplify its maintenance.

Note that the threads library, which provides support for system
threads is still present and actively supported.

Thanks,

Jeremie

** Андрей Бергман asked and Jeremie Dimino replied


> Is it possible to develop multithread applications in Ocaml somehow in Linux?

You can use the "threads" library to write multi-threaded OCaml
applications. It works on Linux, OSX, Windows, ... There is however
one limitation: only one system thread can run OCaml code at a time.
There is a work-in-progress to enable multiple system threads to run
OCaml code simultaneously, the following page describes the state of
this project: https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore/wiki

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2019-03/msg00004.html

** Damien Doligez announced


The release of OCaml 4.08.0 is approaching. We have created a
second beta version to help you adapt your software to the new
features ahead of the release.

The source code is available at these addresses:

 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.08.0+beta2.tar.gz\\
 https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.08/ocaml-4.08.0+beta2.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands.

#+begin_src shell
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src shell
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2+<VARIANT> --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
 where you replace <VARIANT> with one of these:
 - afl
 - default_unsafe_string
 - flambda
 - fp
 - fp+flambda

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
 http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/bug_report_page.php

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.


The changes from beta1 are the following:

- The --enable-flambda configuration option now works correctly
  (beta1 would ignore it).

- * GPR#2104, GPR#2211, PR#4127, PR#7709: Fix Thread.sigmask. When
  system threads are loaded, Unix.sigprocmask is now an alias for
  Thread.sigmask. This changes the behavior at least on MacOS, where
  Unix.sigprocmask used to change the masks of all threads.
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by Jérémie Dimino)

- GPR#2263: Delete the deprecated Bigarray.*.map_file functions in
  favour of ~*_of_genarray (Unix.map_file ...)~ functions instead. The
  ~Unix.map_file~ function was introduced in OCaml 4.06.0 onwards.
  (Jérémie Dimino, reviewed by David Allsopp and Anil Madhavapeddy)

- GPR#2239: Fix match miscompilation with flambda
  (Leo White, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#2223: ocamltest: fix the "bsd" and "not-bsd" built-in actions to
  recognize all BSD variants
  (Damien Doligez, review by Sébastien Hinderer and David Allsopp)

- GPR#2264, MPR#7904: the configure script now sets the Unicode handling mode
  under Windows according to the value of the variable WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE. If
  WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE is "ansi" then it is assumed to be the current code page
  encoding. If WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE is "compatible" or empty or not set at all,
  then encoding is UTF-8 with code page fallback.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Sébastien Hinderer and David Allsopp)

- GPR#2266: ensure Cygwin ports configure with ~EXE=.exe~, or the compiler is
  unable to find the camlheader files (subtle regression of GPR#2139/2041)
  (David Allsopp, report and review by Sébastien Hinderer)

- MPR#7918, GPR#1703, GPR#1944, GPR#2213, GPR#2257: Add the module
  Compile_common, which factorizes the common part in Compile and
  Optcompile. This also makes the pipeline more modular.
  (Gabriel Radanne, help from Gabriel Scherer and Valentin
   Gatien-Baron, review by Mark Shinwell and Gabriel Radanne,
   regression spotted by Clément Franchini)

- GPR#2160: restore --disable-shared support and ensure testsuite runs correctly
  when compiled without shared library support.
  (David Allsopp, review by Damien Doligez and Sébastien Hinderer)

- GPR#2229: Env: remove prefix_idents cache
  (Thomas Refis, review by Frédéric Bour and Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#2231: Env: always freshen persistent signatures before using them
  (Thomas Refis and Leo White, review by Gabriel Radanne)

- MPR#7923, GPR#2259: fix regression in FlexDLL bootstrapped build caused by
  refactoring the root Makefile for Dune in GPR#2093)
  (David Allsopp, report by Marc Lasson)

- MPR#7929, GPR#2261: Subst.signature: call cleanup_types exactly once
  (Thomas Refis, review by Gabriel Scherer and Jacques Garrigue,
  report by Daniel Bünzli and Jon Ludlam)
      

** Daniel Bünzli then said


Having installed the beta1 this invocation:

#+begin_src shell
  opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git 
#+end_src

Resulted in: 

#+begin_example
  [ERROR] No compiler matching 'ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2' found, use 'opam switch list-available' to see what is available, or use '--packages' to select packages explicitly.
#+end_example

Updating the beta repo manually which was registred by my first install with 

#+begin_src shell
  opam update beta
#+end_src

and then applying the above command works.

** Continuing this old thread, Darren announced


The project is finally published, [[https://github.com/darrenldl/ProVerif-ATP/tree/master/narrator/][here]] is the link to the relevant OCaml sources for drawing knowledge graph and HTML. ~src/cytoscape.ml~ is the binding to the Cytoscape JS library, ~src/dagre.ml~ is the binding to Dagre JS graph layout library.

We have a [[https://darrenldl.gitlab.io/narrator-ch07/][demo site]] where you can see it in action. You'll need to click "Show knowledge graph" to see the display of knowledge graph however.

> Well writing a layout algorithm would be fairly easy I think.

Famous last words.

I have a project that aims to collect algorithms to layout trees: https://github.com/Drup/tree_layout

I suspect the "Layered" algorithm would be sufficient for your purpose, but you can also find lot's of different type of tree visualisation [[http://treevis.net/][here]]. Formally, what you are looking for is an algorithm for layered trees where the rank of nodes is prescribed. There are several such algorithms.

If you end up implementing something from the literature (or improving on it), I would be happy to add it to the collection! :)

Unicode 12.0.0 was released on the 5th of march. 

It adds 553 characters to the standard including additional Tamil fractions for your [dividing pleasure][0]. See [here][1] for details about all the additions.

Accordingly the libraries mentioned at the end of this message had to be updated, consult the individual release notes for details. Both Uucd and Uucp are incompatible releases sinces new script and block enumerants had to be added.

As always if Unicode still puzzles you, have a look at Uucp’s absolute minimal Unicode [introduction][2].

Best and happy fractioning,

Daniel

* ppx_factory v0.0.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppx-factory-v0-0-0/3458/1

** Nathan Rebours announced


Cryptosense is happy to announce the initial release of ~ppx_factory~!

~ppx_factory~ is a ppx that will derive factory methods from your record and variant type definitions. It's partly inspired by factory_bot, factory_boy and such alternatives in various other languages. The idea of factory methods is that they are meant to replace test fixtures and allow you to build test values while only defining the bits that are relevant to your test.

For example, the following code:
#+begin_src ocaml
type t =
  | A of {aa : int; ab: string}
  | B of {ba : bool; bb : float list }
[@@deriving factory]
#+end_src
will provide you with:
#+begin_src ocaml
val a_factory : ?aa: int -> ?ab: string -> unit -> t
val b_factory : ?ba: int -> ?bb: string -> unit -> t
#+end_src

The use of factories improved the quality and legibility of our test code a lot and we hope ~ppx_factory~ can prove as helpful to you as it is to us!

It's in a beta release at this point so any feedback is appreciated!

You can find it on [[https://github.com/cryptosense/ppx_factory][github]] and opam!
      



* Dune 1.8.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-1-8-0/3463/1

** Rudi Grinberg announced


On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce release 1.8. The highlight of this release is a standalone preprocessor that allows OCaml programs to use the new let bindings introduced in 1.8 and still be compatible with OCaml versions all the way back to 4.02.

This release includes some important contributions from a new contributor: @aalekseyev. So I would like to use this opportunity to welcome him to the team. Thanks Arseniy!

The change log is replicated here for your convenience:

*** 1.8.0 (07/03/2019)

- Clean up watch mode polling loop: improves signal handling and error handling
  during polling (#1912, fix #1907, fix #1671, @aalekseyev)

- Change status messages during polling to be one-line, so that the messages are
  correctly erased by ^K. (#1912, @aalekseyev)

- Add support for ~.cxx~ extension for C++ stubs (#1831, @rgrinberg)

- Add ~DUNE_WORKSPACE~ variable. This variable is equivalent to setting
  ~--workspace~ in the command line. (#1711, fix #1503, @rgrinberg)

- Add ~c_flags~ and ~cxx_flags~ to env profile settings (#1700 and #1800,
  @gretay-js)

- Format ~dune printenv~ output (#1867, fix #1862, @emillon)

- Add the ~(promote-into <dir>)~ and ~(promote-until-clean-into
  <dir>)~ modes for ~(rule ...)~ stanzas, so that files can be
  promoted in another directory than the current one. For instance,
  this is used in merlin to promote menhir generated files in a
  directory that depends on the version of the compiler (#1890, @diml)

- Improve error message when ~dune subst~ fails (#1898, fix #1897, @rgrinberg)

- Add more GC counters to catapult traces (fix908, @rgrinberg)

- Add a preprocessor shim for the ~let+~ syntax of OCaml 4.08 (#1899,
  implements #1891, @diml)

- Fix generation of ~.merlin~ files on Windows. ~\~ characters needed
  to be escaped (#1869, @mlasson)

- Fix 0 error code when ~$ dune format-dune-file~ fails. (#1915, fix #1914,
  @rgrinberg)

- Configurator: deprecated ~query_expr~ and introduced ~query_expr_err~ which is
  the same but with a better error in case it fails. (#1886, @ejgallego)

- Make sure ~(menhir (mode promote) ...)~ stanzas are ignored when
  using ~--ignore-promoted-rules~ or ~-p~ (#1917, @diml)
      



* owl 0.5.0 released
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-owl-0-5-0-released/3466/1

** Marcello Seri announced


*** owl 0.5.0

We are happy to announce the new release of ~owl~, a dedicated system for scientific and engineering computing in OCaml.

The project is thoroughly documented at [[http://ocaml.xyz][ocaml.xyz]] where you can find multiple examples of use. Notable demos are the [[http://demo.ocaml.xyz/index.html][Google Inception demo]] and the [[http://demo.ocaml.xyz/neuraltrans.html][Neural Style Transfer demo]]

This release, coming a year after the latest 0.4.0 release, includes multiple improvements in terms of fixed bugs, performance and in the internals of the [[http://ocaml.xyz/chapter/algodiff.html][algorithmic differentiation engine]].

It also comes with a large rewrite on the way both ~owl~ and some of the libraries it depends on are built, hopefully making its installation much easier and more flexible. Currently ~owl 0.5.0~ should  compile seamlessly on osx and multiple linux distributions (including debian, fedora and alpine), with the only known exception of ubuntu (that requires a custom manual build of OpenBLAS). You can now also enable experimental features, like the OpenMP/AEOS, or customise the c/c++ build flags, directly when building wih opam by setting or passing the right env variables (refer to ~owl~ and ~eigen~ READMEs for further information).

This release also reduces he number of dependencies and stubs, moving toward a more modular approach for the framework: the tensorflow graph and ~plplot~ bindings are now provided by separate packages, with ~owl-plplot~ already released and ~owl-tensorflow~ coming soon. A new plot package (and its ~jupyter~ integration module) are also in development, allowing to generate plots using ~gnuplot~.

You can read more about it on the official documentation page [[http://ocaml.xyz/][ocaml.xyz]] and on the ~odoc~ generated one [[http://ocaml.xyz/owl][ocaml.xyz/owl]].


*** owl-ode

In conjunction with this release we are also happy to announce the first release of ~owl-ode~ and ~owl-ode-sundials~.

The first is a small OCaml library providing the most common numerical ode integrators, in single-step and adaptive versions and fully compatible with ~owl~ type system. One interesting feature of ~owl~vis that a larger and larger part of its core supports compilation via ~js_of_ocaml~, ~owl-ode~ falls in the category of packages that support compilation to js.
~owl-ode~ also comes with support for symplectic integrators, providing an interesting framework to develop Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods.

You can access the documentation of ~owl-ode~ inclusive of a small tutorial at [[http://ocaml.xyz/owl_ode/owl-ode][ocaml.xyz/owl_ode/owl-ode]] and [[http://ocaml.xyz/apidoc/ode.html][ocaml.xyz/apidoc/ode.html]]. Further examples are [[https://github.com/owlbarn/owl_ode/tree/master/examples][available on the sources repository]].

The second library is a wrapper to the ~sundialsml~ library, allowing to use the battle tested ~cvode~ directly on ~owl~.

Both libraries are in their early days, and multiple features are still missing, but have been designed keeping in mind the ergonomics and flexibility from day one. To demonstrate this we synced the release with ~ocaml-cviode~, a small OCaml library that provides lower order contact geometric integrators and is fully reliant on ~owl-ode~ to do the heavy lifting and provide the integration interface.

The future plans for ~owl-ode~ include:

- making the libraries more robust and better tested
- complete the ~sundialsml~ wrapper and document it
- add a wrapper to ~ocaml-odepack~
- replicate Neural ODEs directly in owl

Every help is welcome!

** Daniel Bünzli announced


It's my pleasure to announce a new release of odig.

 odig is a command line tool to lookup documentation of installed
 OCaml packages. It shows package metadata, readmes, change logs,
 licenses, cross-referenced odoc API documentation and manuals.

To browse the documentation of your opam switch's packages simply
proceed with:

#+begin_src shell
    opam install ocaml-manual odig
    odig doc
#+end_src

An odig manual and the packaging conventions can be consulted via:

#+begin_src shell
    odig doc odig # or see https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/odig
#+end_src

A sample output on a best-effort maximal set of packages of the
opam repository can be found here:

    https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/

The highlights of this release are:

- Support for the latest odoc (includes navigation improvements).

- Support for mld manuals and package landing page customization. See for example: https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/odig

- Support for API documentation themes. The default odoc theme and light and dark themes optimized for legibility are bundled with odig; and you can bring your own via opam packages. The odig default themes can be spotted online by following the links here: https://github.com/b0-system/odig#sample-odoc-api-documentation-and-manuals

- Support for OCaml manual theming when the ~ocaml-manual~ package is installed. Provides a best-effort (for better results a closer rework of the manual HTML gen would be needed) seamless style transition between API docs and the OCaml manual. For example follow the link to the manual on: https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/

The release notes have all the details, especially removals details from 0.0.3:

    https://github.com/b0-system/odig/blob/v0.0.4/CHANGES.md

Most of this is brought to you thanks to support added in ~odoc~
by Thomas Refis and Rizo Isrof. Thanks also to Thomas Refis for
helping with ~odoc~ driving details, with ~odoc~ bug chasing and
discussions.

* An intermediate abstraction between applicatives and monads
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 11
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/an-intermediate-abstraction-between-applicatives-and-monads/3441/1

** Jérémie Dimino announced


I'm happy to share the following paper introducing an abstraction between applicatives and monads. The paper uses Dune as a case study and in particular gives some insights as to how Dune makes use of such abstractions.

One typical example of applicative in OCaml is the Cmdliner library, and one typical example of monad in the Lwt library. Selective functors come in between, allowing to fully analyse a computation beforehand, just as cmdliner does in order to produce man pages, while still allowing to select between different branches at runtime, as one can do with Lwt.

You can also find OCaml examples in this github repository: https://github.com/snowleopard/selective-ocaml

https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/andrey.mokhov/selective-functors.pdf
      

** some questions were asked and Andrey Mokhov replied


Yaron Minsky:
> Do you know where the origin of selective functors is? Does this come out of Dune itself, or is it older still?

Yaron: I personally got interested in selective functors in the context of hardware design, but after learning from Jeremie about Dune, I got curious about "selective build systems", which have unique features unavailable to applicative or monadic ones. Haxl came later as a complete surprise.

Selective-like type classes have previously appeared in the context of parsing and web programming. For example, [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/dissertation.pdf][in his dissertation]] Jeremy Yallop mentions ~DynamicIdiom~ type class with the method ~branch :: f Bool -> f a -> f a -> f a~, which is our derived ~ifS~ combinator, but doesn't really explore it (we've learned about this after the submission).

Tim Mc Gilchrist:
> I was expecting a discussion of Function Reactive Programming.

Tim: you are right, FRP is relevant and we should have probably mentioned it. I've added this to our TODO list.

As for Incremental, I think it relies on monads in a fundamental way. I don't think it can be made selective.

> Is the equivalent OCaml library available yet?

Yes: https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/selective/
      

** Yaron Minsky then said


I'm a bit doubtful of your analysis of Incremental. Incremental has a monadic interface, for sure. But there are big differences between the performance of the applicative subset of that monadic interface, and most Incremental programming is done using the applicative subset alone.

I think this is a common situation with monadic libraries, where the applicative subset is in some sense special. I'm not sure selective would be useful here, but I could imagine it turning out to be helpful in exposing APIs that are more expressive than the applicative subset and more performant than the monadic part of the API. An example that was raised internally is that Incremental.if is special-cased in a way that might fit nicely into Selective.

** Simon Cruanes announced


@Drup and myself have the pleasure to announce the first release of [[https://github.com/c-cube/iter][Iter]] (née ~Sequence~). Its version is 1.2, following Sequence 1.1.  We renamed ~Sequence~ into ~Iter~ to remove some confusion with ~Seq~ (the stdlib's iterator type).

~Iter~ provides combinators to create, consume, and transform iterators of type ~('a -> unit) -> unit~; in other words, partially applied ~iter~ function such as ~Hashtbl.iter~, ~List.iter~, ~Array.iter~, etc. It has a wealth of advanced combinators and performs very well even with nested ~flat_map~, ~map~, etc. A very simple example that manipulates a series of integers:

#+begin_src ocaml
# #require "iter";;
# let p x = x mod 5 = 0 in
  Iter.(1 -- 5_000
   |> filter p
   |> map (fun x -> x * x)
   |> fold (+) 0);;

** Jérémie Dimino announced


The upcoming OCaml 4.08 release will allow developers to define custom bindings operators. We were eager to use this feature in the code of Dune but because we are currently keeping compatibility with all versions of OCaml since 4.02, we decided to implement a preprocessor shim for older OCaml versions. Given that this shim works quite well, we are also making it available for users of Dune starting with version 1.8 which will be released soon. This post explains how to use this new feature.

*** The future_syntax preprocessor

If you want to use custom bindings in your code but need to keep your code compatible with OCaml < 4.08, you can use the special ~future_syntax~ preprocessor introduced in Dune 1.8. To do that, simply add the following field to your library/executable stanza:

#+begin_src scheme
(preprocess future_syntax)
#+end_src

When using OCaml >= 4.08, this is exactly equivalent to just deleting this field. This means that ~future_syntax~ doesn't add overheard when using a recent version of the compiler. When using using OCaml < 4.08, this will automatically add a pre-processor that will translate special ~let+~, ~let*~, ~and+~, ... operators into valid pre-4.08 OCaml code, allowing your code to compile with an older compiler.

*** Limitation

The shim preprocessor converts bindings operators to OCaml identifiers of the form ~let__XXX~ and ~and__XXX~. For instance, ~let+*~ is translated to ~let__plus_star~. So you must make sure to not use such identifiers in your code.

*** Complete example

The following example uses the ~future_syntax~ preprocessor and bindings operators in code using the cmdliner library.

~dune~ file:

#+begin_src scheme
(executable
 (name foo)
 (libraries cmdliner)
 (preprocess future_syntax))
#+end_src

~foo.ml~ file:

#+begin_src ocaml
open Cmdliner

let ( let+ ) t f =
  Term.(const f $ t)
let ( and+ ) a b =
  Term.(const (fun x y -> x, y) $ a $ b)

let term =
  let+ a = Arg.(value & flag & info ["a"] ~doc:"blah")
  and+ b = Arg.(value & flag & info ["b"] ~doc:"blah")
  and+ c = Arg.(value & flag & info ["c"] ~doc:"blah")
  in
  Printf.printf "a=%B b=%B c=%B\n" a b c

let cmd = (term, Term.info "foo" ~version:"v1.0.3" ~doc:"example")

let () = Term.(exit @@ eval cmd)
#+end_src

You can test this example with:

#+begin_src shell
dune exec ./foo.exe -- -a -b
#+end_src

Without bindingins operators, ~foo.ml~ would have to be written as follow:

#+begin_src ocaml
open Cmdliner

let term =
  let main a b c =
    Printf.printf "a=%B b=%B c=%B\n" a b c
  in
  Term.(const main
        $ Arg.(value & flag & info ["a"] ~doc:"blah")
        $ Arg.(value & flag & info ["b"] ~doc:"blah")
        $ Arg.(value & flag & info ["c"] ~doc:"blah")
       )

let cmd = (term, Term.info "foo" ~version:"v1.0.3" ~doc:"example")

let () = Term.(exit @@ eval cmd)
#+end_src

Which shows that binding operators are especially nice when working with such API; indeed, without binding operators the authors and readers of the code have to manually match the order of arguments passed to ~main~ with the order of the ~Arg.(...)~ expressions inside the ~Term.(...)~ expression. With binding operators, the OCaml variable to which the evaluation of the command line argument is bound is right next to its definition, which is much nicer to read and write.
      

** Richard Davison


This looks awesome!  Just got a question about versioning of the ~future_syntax~ preprocessor.  I like how easy it is to specify it in the dune files, but I'm concerned about what will happen if one day you want to deprecate this preprocessor and support yet another "future_syntax".

For example, in the python2 community, it's common to see people specifically select which future syntaxes to use by writing:
#+begin_src python
from __future__ import print_function
#+end_src
      

** Jérémie Dimino


~future_syntax~ will be versioned in the same way as other features provided by dune. If in the future we decide to change what ~future_syntax~ means, then its meaning will simply be tied to the ~(lang dune x.y)~ you write in your ~dune-project~ file.

That said, I don't think we will be able to provide much more than custom binding operators in dune. Indeed, the only form of extensibility provided by the OCaml parser is a lexer hook and ast mappers. This was enough to easily retrofit the let+ syntax, but it won't be enough for other more complex new syntax forms. At some point, we would need to import the whole OCaml frontend, which doesn't seem viable.

I just wanted to let anyone who might be interested know that I have released v1.0.1 of [[https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber.ml][Cucumber.ml]].  There is not much in this release, hence the minor version bump.  Cucumber.ml relies on Janestreet's Base library and there was a change in that library around the Base.List.zip function.  Users should not notice any changes in functionality as it was only used in a private module function.

On a related note, if you actually use Cucumber.ml, I would be very happy to hear it.

** Nicolás Ojeda Bär announced


We are going to switch the OCaml bug tracker from Mantis to GitHub
issues on Thursday, March 14. Existing bug reports will be migrated
with the help of a script. On this day, Mantis will be offline and the
GitHub repository will be read-only until the migration is finished.

A reminder will be sent to this list shortly before the migration.

IMPORTANT: if you wish to have the migrated issues use your GitHub
user name instead of your Mantis user name, you MUST send me both user
names before March 14 so this is taken into account during migration.
This may be convenient if you want to be automatically subscribed to
issues you authored and/or monitored in Mantis and you do not already
subscribe to all GitHub notifications.

Do not hesitate to get back to me if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Nicolás
on behalf of the OCaml development team
      



* Odoc 1.4.0 — new OCaml documentation generator

** Anton Bachin announced


We are pleased to announce release *1.4.0* of [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc][*odoc*]], the new, Dune-friendly documentation generator for OCaml and ReasonML.

Some sample output, which you can browse [[http://odis.io/odoc-demo/order/Order/index.html][here]]:

https://discourse-cdn-sjc2.com/standard11/uploads/ocaml/original/2X/1/1b992b304a0170b78f2d9af259d78dabef95c319.png

You can install odoc and generate docs for your Dune project with:

#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam install odoc
dune build @doc
#+end_src

Then, view the docs by opening ~_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html~!

While release 1.4.0 has new features, it is mainly focused on stability and maintainability. See its full changelog [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/releases/tag/1.4.0][here]]. The previous release, 1.3.0 last October, included a lot of new code. Because of concerns about its stability, we chose not to widely announce 1.3.0. So, this message serves as an announcement for both releases :) The full changelog for 1.3.0 can be found [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/releases/tag/1.3.0][here]].

In summary, compared with 1.2.0, odoc now has:

- [[http://odis.io/odoc-demo/order/Order/index.html][New appearance]].
- Tables of contents on each page.
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/156][Generation of docs in ReasonML syntax]].
- [[https://ostera.github.io/bsdoc/docs/BsDoc/][Interop with BuckleScript]].
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/214][Parallel packaging for NPM and esy]].
- New, error-recovering comment parser with helpful error messages.
- *Many* bugfixes.
- Compatibility with OCaml 4.08 (at least, the current beta releases).
- Much more streamlined development process, cleaner code, more tests and CI, etc.

For now, we plan to continue improving the stability of odoc and the quality of its output. In the longer term, odoc has two significant goals:

- To replace ocamldoc as OCaml's primary documentation generator. At the core of odoc is a powerful cross-referencer, capable of fully handling the complexity of OCaml's module system. Shortcomings in ocamldoc's ability to resolve cross-references in complex projects were one of the original motivations for starting odoc.

- To create centrally-hosted, cross-referenced, searchable online documentation for all the published packages in opam, a “~docs.ocaml.org~.”

Thanks to the odoc users and contributors, and happy documenting!

I think it is also worth showing the styles Daniel has done based on the new markup, which are also pretty nice:

https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc@odoc.default/alcotest/Alcotest/index.html

(that last one is the new odoc default for comparison)
      

** Later in the discussion, Daniel Bünzli said


JaneStreet's documentation has precisely been updated with this tool. If you are unhappy with the theme they choose you can simply:

#+begin_src shell
    opam install ocaml-manual base odig
    odig odoc-theme list # spot the theme id you'd like
    odig odoc-theme set --default mytheme
    odig doc base
#+end_src

Regarding the OCaml API reference just ~odig doc ocaml~ and if you install the manual as above it will theme accordingly (see for example [[https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/ocaml-manual/index.html][here]] for the manual themed according to ~odig.light~ --- though the api reference that comes with the manual itself doesn't, just use the ~odig~ generated one).

If you are still unhappy about the selection of themes just [[https://b0-system.github.io/odig/doc/odig/packaging.html#theme_install][provide]] your own and distribute it via opam.
