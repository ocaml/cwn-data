Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-maintenance-releease-mirage-crypto/13049/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


it is my pleasure to announce the just released mirage-crypto 0.11.2 library. This includes a workaround for
miscompilation that happens on macOS/arm64 with clang 14.0.3 (which lead to various issues
(https://github.com/ulrikstrid/ocaml-jose/issues/63, https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/issues/478) -- initially
reported and bisected by @samoht. The fix is to not run the LLVM instcombine pass (--instcombine-max-iterations=0) - or have apple fix their software chain eventually (e.g. clang 14.0.4 contains a fix) -- but it looks like it is a
long path how they push updates to customers.

So, if you end up on a macOS system where the elliptic curve test cases fail, please upgrade to this release.

There are other minor bugfixes, support for the newly released eio in version 0.12 (now using partially variants
and less objects), support for DragonFlyBSD and GNU/Hurd.

Thanks to all old and especially the new contributors (take a look at
https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/releases/tag/v0.11.2 if interested, there is as well the full list of
changes), and those of you who won't observe any changes please excuse me for wasting your CPU cycles to recompile
mirage-crypto itself and its reverse dependencies.

** Thibaut Mattio announced


Welcome to the fifth edition of the OCaml Platform newsletter!

Dive into the latest updates from August and discover how the [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform][OCaml Platform]] is
evolving. Just like our [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/platform-newsletter][previous newsletters]], we'll spotlight
the recent developments and enhancements to the OCaml development workflows.

In August, we unveiled the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-roadmap-for-the-ocaml-platform-seeking-your-feedback/12238/30][initial draft of the OCaml Platform
roadmap]], following
the recently adopted [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-principles][Guiding Principles]] and [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-users][User
Personas]]. The thread has seen a lot of activity, and we're thrilled to see
so much engagement to discuss the direction of OCaml developer tooling. A warm thank you for actively joining the
conversation and sharing your feedback! This has prompted numerous discussions with the Platform maintainers, and
we're considering all your feedback as we're working on revisions to the roadmap.

Another headline from August was initiating the integration of ~wasm_of_ocaml~ into Dune in order to compile OCaml
programs to WebAssembly (Wasm). This follows the recent [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/announcing-the-ocaml-wasm-organisation/12676][announcement of the ~ocaml-wasm~
organisation]]. This is an exciting time!
Compiling OCaml programs to WebAssembly is becoming a reality!

But more on that below. Let's delve into all the progress that happened last month.

*** Building Packages

**** *[Dune]* Exploring Package Management in Dune

Contributors: @rgrinberg (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV (Tarides), @gridbugs (Tarides), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides),
@Alizter

This month saw good progress on supporting lock directory generation for more opam packages by adding support for
various opam features. Notably, the team implemented a new [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8443][~when~ action]]
to support opam's conditional build steps and the accompanying PR to [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8502][convert opam filters to ~when~
actions]].

Work also started on [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7707][initialising Dune's context from the lock file]].
This is the last missing piece that ties all the implemented features together (source fetching, opam-repository
management, lock directory generation, etc.). This makes it possible to run ~dune build~ to build a project that
has opam dependencies.

The work on the above -- extending coverage of opam packages when generating the lock directory and initialisation
of Dune's context from the lock directory -- should continue next month. The team also started tracking missing
features in Dune's backlog more thoroughly. You can have a look at the [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22package+management%22][list of issues on
GitHub]].

**** *[opam]* Native Support for Windows in opam 2.2

Contributors: @rjbou (OCamlPro), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides), @dra27 (Tarides), @AltGr (OCamlPro)

Following the release of the [[https://ocaml.org/changelog/2023-07-26-opam-2-2-0-alpha2][second alpha of opam 2.2]]
last month, the opam team started working on the third alpha and merged [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/milestone/53?closed=1][numerous bug fixes and
improvements]].

They also started working on [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5647][generating static binaries for Windows]].

The next step, in anticipation to the first beta release of opam 2.2, is to make the ~opam-repository~ compatible
with Windows by upstreaming patches from
[[https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam-repository-mingw][ocaml-opam/opam-repository-mingw]] and
[[https://github.com/dra27/opam-repository][dra27/opam-repository]].

The work on this will continue next month, but in the meantime, don't hesitate to [[https://ocaml.org/changelog/2023-07-26-opam-2-2-0-alpha2#try-it][install opam
2.2~alpha2]] and report any issue you have!

**** *[Dune]* Compile to WebAssembly with ~wasm_of_ocaml~

Contributors: @vouillon (Tarides), @hhugo

Following the recent [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/announcing-the-ocaml-wasm-organisation/12676][announcement of the ocaml-wasm
organisation]], the
[[https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml][~wasm_of_ocaml~]] team landed a [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8278][PR on
Dune]] that brings support for compiling OCaml programs to WebAssembly
(Wasm)!

The target user experience will be similar to the JavaScript compilation on Dune; that is, you'll be able to add
~wasm~ as a mode to Dune executables:

#+begin_example
(executable (name foo) (modes wasm))
#+end_example

And running ~dune build~ will produce a Wasm binary.

The PR is in the early stage and is in active review, but given the impressive progress of the ~wasm_of_ocaml~ team
on the [[https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml/issues/5][runtime implementation]], do stay tuned for more
updates on this in the coming weeks and months.

*Activities:*
- ~wasm_of_ocaml~ support -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8278][ocaml/dune#8278]]

**** *[Dune]* ~dune monitor~: Connect to a Running Dune build

Contributors: @Alizter

In July, @Alizter started work on a new ~dune monitor~ command to connect to a running Dune build.

This work continued this month, and as part it, lots of improvements were made to Dune RPC, including [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8212][reports of
failed jobs]] and [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8191][better error
messages]].

[[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8152][The PR]] has been merged and the new command will be available in the
upcoming Dune 3.11, scheduled for September.

*Activities:*
- Dune monitor -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8152][ocaml/dune#8152]]

**** *[Dune]* Dune Terminal User Interface

Contributors: @Alizter, @rgrinberg (Tarides)

[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-platform-newsletter-april-2023/12187#dune-dune-terminal-user-interface-7][Back in
April]],
Dune introduced a new ~tui~ display mode, contributed by @Alizter, which was a meant as a foundation to bring a
GUI-like experience to Dune.

The saga continued in August, and @Alizter ported the TUI to [[https://github.com/let-def/lwd][Nottui]], a
terminal-based user interface library, to add more interactivity to the ~tui~ mode. In particular, the error
messages are now scrollable, and they can be expanded/minimised.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8614547/262112028-a367f7ca-023f-4470-a02a-a19617aa35f6.webm

These features will be available in the upcoming Dune 3.11. Do try the new TUI and let the Dune team know if you
have any feedback!

*Activities*:
- Interactive TUI -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/8429][ocaml/dune#8429]]

*** Generating Documentation

**** *[odoc]* Add Search Capabilities to ~odoc~

Contributors: @panglesd (Tarides), @EmileTrotignon (Tarides), @julow (Tarides), @jonludlam (Tarides)

After fixing some of the issues identified last month, the ~odoc~ team started actively reviewing the Pull Request
to [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/972][add a search bar to ~odoc~'s HTML output]].

As a result of the reviews, a few related issues were identified and have been addressed as a prerequisite to move
forward on the search feature. Notably, improvements were needed on the stability of [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/909][link to source
code]] by [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/993][implementing semantic
anchors]].

Next month, the odoc team plans to continue reviewing the different Pull Requests, with the aim to cut a major
release of odoc with support for search the following weeks.

*Activities:*
- Support for search in ~odoc~ -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/972][ocaml/odoc#972]]
- Collect occurrences information -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/976][ocaml/odoc#976]]
- Stable anchors in links to implementation -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/993][ocaml/odoc#993]]

**** *[~odoc~]* Syntax for Images and Assets in ~odoc~

Contributors: @panglesd (Tarides)

Following the discussion started in July, the ~odoc~ team started the implementation work to add support for images
and assets in ~odoc~.

Work is ongoing to implement a syntax to reference arbitrary assets, as a requirement to both the search feature
and the support for images.

We're getting closer and closer to having images on OCaml.org's centralised package documentation!

*** Editing and Refactoring Code

**** *[Merlin]* Support for Project-Wide References in Merlin

Contributors: @voodoos (Tarides), @trefis (Tarides), @Ekdohibs (OcamlPro)

As announced last month, the focus in August was on upstreaming the necessary changes to the compiler. A [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12508][PR on the
compiler]] was opened and is currently under active review. The Merlin
team is hopeful that it will be merged in time for the next release of OCaml 5.2.

The team is also considering backporting the patches on previous versions of the compiler and making them available
on opam. This would allow people to start testing the feature early, without having to wait for the release of
OCaml 5.2.

*Activities:*
- Add support for project-wide occurrences -- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12508][ocaml/ocaml#12508]]
- Use new compile information in CMT files to build and aggregate indexes -- [[https://github.com/voodoos/ocaml-uideps/pull/5][voodoos/ocaml-uideps#5]]
- Dune orchestrates index generation -- [[https://github.com/voodoos/dune/pull/1][voodoos/dune#1]]
- Use new CMT info to provide buffer occurrences and indexes for project-wide occurrences -- [[https://github.com/voodoos/merlin/pull/7][voodoos/merlin#7]]
- Support project-wide occurrences in ~ocaml-lsp~ -- [[https://github.com/voodoos/ocaml-lsp/pull/1][voodoos/ocaml-lsp#1]]
      



* Melange 2.0

** Antonio Nuno Monteiro announced


the Melange team is proud to announce the release of Melange 2.0.

Melange is a backend for the OCaml compiler that emits JavaScript. It strives to provide the best integration with
both the OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, enabling modern JS workflows and compiling OCaml / Reason to performant,
readable JavaScript.

Lots of work went into this release. One of the highlights is its compatibility with OCaml 5.1, [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-5-1-0-released/13021][released just last
week]].

I wrote a more comprehensive release announcement in the following post. As always, feedback is very much
appreciated.

https://anmonteiro.substack.com/p/introducing-melange-20

This release of Melange is sponsored by [Ahrefs](ahrefs.com) and the [[https://ocaml-sf.org/][OCaml Software
Foundation]].

** Ryan Moore announced


I made a small, clickable canvas chart example for the browser using Js_of_ocaml,
[[https://erratique.ch/software/brr][Brr]], and [[https://erratique.ch/software/vg][Vg]].  The
[[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_vg_example_plot][code]] is on GitHub, and you can check out a live
[[https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_vg_example_plot/][demo]] as well.  Perhaps the code may prove useful as another
example for anyone wanting to try out the Brr or Vg packages.

It was actually fairly quick to make as Vg provides some pretty powerful drawing primitives, and Brr really
simplifies interacting with the DOM and JavaScript values.

Here a screenshot of the [[https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_vg_example_plot/][demo]]:

** Jon Sterling announced


I am pleased to announce the release of Forester 2.4 on opam, which is an OCaml utility to develop “Forests”, which
are densely interlinked mathematical websites / Zettelkästen similar to the [[https://stacks.math.columbia.edu][Stacks
project]] or [[https://kerodon.net][Kerodon]]. You can see the
[[https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-007M.xml][changelog]] on my own [[https://www.jonmsterling.com][Forest]].

This release adds support for wikilinks, among other things. There are some breaking changes to the XML format, so
to upgrade an existing forest, make sure to copy in the XSLT and CSS resources from the latest version of the
[[https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/forest-template][forest template]].

---

This month will feature the following talks :

*Chamelon : un minimiseur de programmes pour et en OCaml -- Milla Valnet*

*Modern DSL compiler architecture in OCaml our experience with Catala -- Louis Gesbert* (@AltGr)
In this presentation, we intend to show a state-of-the-art DSL implementation in OCaml, with concrete examples and
experience reports.
In particular, we found that some advanced practices, while accepted among the hardcore OCaml developers (e.g. use
of row type variables through object types), lacked visibility and documentation: some of them deserve to be better
known.
Our experience is based on [[https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala][the Catala compiler]], a DSL for the
implementation of algorithms defined in law.
      



* Fmlib 0.5.5 with emphasis on combinator parsing with lexers

:CUSTOM_ID: 10
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-fmlib-0-5-5-with-emphasis-on-combinator-parsing-with-lexers/13102/1

** Helmut announced


I am pleased to annouce version 0.5.5 of the functional library ~fmlib~.  The main part of version 0.5.5 is the
sublibrary ~Fmlib_parse~ which has now support for combinator parsing with the separation of parsing and lexing.
The new version is available via opam.

Combinator parsers usually do not separate the parser from the lexer. This is a disadvantage in parsing languages
which have keywords which look like identifiers. A combinator parser usually needs a lot of backtracking (which
costs sperformance) when parsing such a language.

In order to improve the situation ~Fmlib_parse~ allows the separation of parsing and lexing. The lexer usually
needs very little or no backtracking to parse the lexical tokens. Any backtracking in the parser does not pushback
larges sequences of characters to the input stream, it just pushes back already correctly parsed lexical tokens
(which is cheaper) and does not need to rescan the pushed back lexical tokens character by character. See
https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/parse_lex.html for details.

Furthermore the sublibrary ~Fmlib_browse~ supports the function ~map~ on virtual doms and attributes of the virtual
dom and allows subscriptions ~on_animation~. Look into https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_browser/doc.html to
see how ~Fmlib_browser~ supports web applications written in ocaml.
