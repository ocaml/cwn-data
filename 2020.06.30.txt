roddy announced
───────────────

  Announcing [finch], a simple static site generator. It uses content
  written as Markdown plus YAML frontmatter like Jekyll/Hugo etc. and
  produces output with [Jingoo] templates. It also has some integrations
  with React (as in the JS library) in the form of Jingoo filters: the
  motivation behind it was to make it easier to develop sites that use
  React just for some in some parts rather than structuring the whole
  site as a single page application.

ANN: Releases of ringo
══════════════════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-releases-of-ringo/5605/3]


Raphaël Proust announced
────────────────────────

  Version 0.5 of `ringo' and `ringo-lwt' are now available in
  `opam'. Although this version changes `ringo-lwt' only, both packages
  are released anew to keep the version numbers in sync. This version
  includes:

  • Improvement in documentation.
  • Simplifications and reduction in the memory footprint of lwt-wrapped
    caches.
  • Fix for a race condition in the automatic cleanup (previously, on
    weak caches only, a promise being rejected could cause a different
    promise to be removed from the cache)
  • Fix a leak
  • More test, including a test for leakiness.


OCaml 4.11, first beta release

octachron announced
───────────────────

  The release of OCaml 4.11.0 is approaching.

  After three alpha releases, we have created a first beta version to
  help you adapt your software to the new features ahead of the release.

  The compatibility of the opam ecosystem with OCaml 4.11.0 is currently
  quite good, and it should be possible to test this beta without too
  much trouble.

  The source code is available at these addresses:

  [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0+beta1.tar.gz]
  [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.11/ocaml-4.11.0+beta1.tar.gz]

  The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
  following commands.
  ┌────
  │ opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
  └────
  or
  ┌────
  │ opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta1+VARIANT --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
  └────
  where you replace VARIANT with one of these: afl, flambda, fp,
  fp+flambda

  We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
   [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues]

  If you are interested by the list of new features, and the on-going
  list of bug fixes the updated change log for OCaml 4.11.0 is available

FlexDLL 0.38 released
═════════════════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/flexdll-0-38-released/6043/1]


David Allsopp announced
───────────────────────

  We are pleased to announce the release of FlexDLL 0.38!

  FlexDLL provides a dlopen-like interface for Windows and is used to
  simplify the linking process for the native Windows ports of OCaml and
  to allow dynamic loading of C code (bytecode stub libraries and native
  Dynlink). It is also used for the same purpose in the Cygwin ports of
  OCaml, except that they can be configured without shared library
  support.

  The release includes various bugfixes as well as proper support for
  C++ linking on mingw and linking against data symbols in import
  libraries.

  Please see the [release page] for more information.
