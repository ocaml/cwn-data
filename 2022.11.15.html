<div id="outline-container-orgf5e4b3d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf5e4b3d">Continuing this thread, Paul-Elliot explained</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5e4b3d">
<p>
Let me try to explain a little bit more!
</p>

<p>
So, there are two distinct process:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Installing <code>ocaml-platform</code>. This is done by the installer script which, as you found out, also installs opam.</li>
<li>Installing the platform tools: <code>merlin</code>, <code>dune</code>, <code>ocamlformat</code>, &#x2026; This is done by running <code>ocaml-platform</code> (more explanation of what happens during a run of <code>ocaml-platform</code> below).</li>
</ol>

<p>
For 1., I agree that using a script is not ideal at all. We do want to have a system package, ideally as part of a
distribution. However, we are really at an early stage, and first focused on developing the &ldquo;core&rdquo; functionality,
for feedback before going further.
Note that <code>sudo</code> is only used when needed (for the <code>install</code> command), and that we encourage users to check what is
inside the script: Taken from the README:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t hesitate to have a look at what the script does. In a nutshell, the script will install a static binary into
<code>/usr/local/bin/ocaml-platform</code> as well as the <code>opam</code> binary if it isn&rsquo;t already installed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For 2. here is what happens when you run <code>ocaml-platform</code> (also detailed in the
<a href="https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer#readme">README</a>):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, &ldquo;driving&rdquo; <code>opam</code>, <code>ocaml-platform</code> infer a version of each platform tools (<code>dune</code> <code>merlin</code> etc). It will use the best one available for your version of OCaml, except for <code>ocamlformat</code> where it will first search for a <code>.ocamlformat</code> with a specified version.</li>
<li>Then, <code>ocaml-platform</code> checks which of the <code>tools.version</code> it has in a local cache (which is initially empty).</li>
<li>Using <code>opam</code>, it builds in a &ldquo;sandbox switch&rdquo; the ones to build (the ones that are not already in the cache)</li>
<li>it populates the local cache with the newly built package</li>
<li>Using <code>opam</code>, it installs everything from the local cache (which is a local opam repo).</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, to answer your question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What happens when a new version of dune is released, how do I get an update using “ocaml-platform-installer”?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You simply need to run <code>ocaml-plaform</code>, it will know that there is a new version of <code>dune</code> by asking <code>opam</code> the best
version available. (I answered incorrectly the first time as I thought you were specifically speaking about a new
version of <code>ocaml-platform</code>, my apologies!)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&gt; In fact, currently only the <code>ocaml-platform</code> binary is being downloaded.
</p>

<p>
When I look into <code>installer.sh</code>, at least also <code>opam</code> is downloaded and “installed” (copied to PREFIX, there’s a
lack of manpages etc.).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, I forgot about opam&rsquo;s installation&#x2026; I meant that only <code>ocaml-platform</code> (and <code>opam</code>&#x2026;) is downloaded <span class="underline">through
the install script</span>. Other tools are downloaded through opam.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&gt; We do have security in mind!
</p>

<p>
Could you elaborate on that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I simply meant that, when discussing how the tool would work, we tried not to miss security issues. Since most of
the communication with the outside world is done through opam, we felt it was okay, but I am no security expert&#x2026;
and would love specific advices on the matter :)
</p>

<p>
@hannes I hope that I answered your questions in a clearer way!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It looks like the <code>ocaml-platform</code> tool would be beneficial even if you already have <code>opam</code> and a development
environment, as it seems to offer a convenient way to share various developer tools between multiple <code>opam</code> switches
(and it could perhaps build and install itself as one of such tools, so it can be conveniently be kept up to date).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
@edwin that&rsquo;s a good point! There are still some things to work out: since the tool is not switch dependent, having
multiple versions of it (even in multiple switches) might create problem (for instance, v2 updates the cache to the
v2 version, and v1 cannot use the cache anymore. (Similar to opam 1 and 2 with the update of <code>.opam</code>!))

<h2 id="2">Building the OCaml Toolchain with Bazel - PoC</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org9420ce8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9420ce8">Gregg Reynolds announced</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9420ce8">
<p>
I&rsquo;m inordinately pleased to announce that a Proof-of-Concept Bazel build of the OCaml compilers and tools (latest
trunk version) is available for testing and exploration. Tested on MacOS 12.6 and Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS. It is
available at
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/obazl-repository/ocaml">https://github.com/obazl-repository/ocaml</a>
</p>

<p>
This uses a stripped-down version of <a href="https://github.com/obazl/rules_ocaml">rules_ocaml</a>, embedded in the repo in
subdirectory <code>bzl</code>.
</p>

<p>
Currently the following targets build and run: ocamlc, ocamlopt.byte, ocamllex, all of the tools in the <code>tools/</code>
subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
Supports Zig as an alternate C toolchain and as a cross-compiler. I was also able to use the LLVM toolchain at
<a href="https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain">https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain</a>, but that was months ago and I have not tested it with this new version.
But the code is in the WORKSPACE.bazel file, so getting it to work would be a good starter project.
</p>

<p>
Cross-compilation (using Zig) is supported for the C code. Full support is going to take some more work. For
example, to compile a linux runtime on a mac:
</p>

<p>
<code>$ bazel build boot/bin:ocamlrun --config=mac_linuxamd64</code>
</p>

<p>
It uses some interesting Bazel features. For example, it uses platforms and toolchains to support the various
compilers - instead of building ocamlc.byte or ocamlopt.byte, you build one target (boot/compiler) and pass CLI args
telling Bazel which platform (vm or sys) should host the build compiler and which should be the target. Similarly,
debug and instrumented variants are controlled by parameters rather than separate targets. It also supports
fine-grained control of compile/link flags, so developers should be able to optimize for diffferent scenarios. You
can tell it whether or not to compile .mli files separately. You can pass a custom <code>primitives</code> file for use with
<code>-use-prims</code> and it will be used everywhere. Etc.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s far from polished but I think it works well enough for people to do a little testing and exploration.
</p>

<p>
Even if you have no interest in Bazel you may find the notes in the bzl/docs subdir worth looking at. I spent a
<i>lot</i> of time studying the Makefiles and trying to understand the build, and took pretty extensive notes. They&rsquo;re
not very well organized but they have a lot of info, I think.
</p>

<p>
Feedback welcome. I&rsquo;m not sure how far I&rsquo;ll go with this, but I at least want to get complete cross-compilation
working, and I&rsquo;d also really like to get persistent workers going.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge2cc8ce" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge2cc8ce">Danielo Rodríguez asked and Gregg Reynolds replied</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2cc8ce">
<blockquote>
<p>
Is this bazel configuration intended to be used in ocaml projects or it is a way to cross-compile the ocaml tools
itself?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Only for building the compilers.  The general rules_ocaml ruleset must support a lot of stuff that is not needed for
building the compilers (e.g. ppx support), and the build protocol for bootstrapping compilers is a little more
complicated than the standard build protocol.  For that very reason (among others), compiler developers need a build
program that they can understand and modify with reasonable effort. So I decided to make the OCaml boot rules as
minimal and understandable as possible (I forgot to add &ldquo;maintinability&rdquo; in the Goals section of the readme.)  I
think eventually the Bazel rules (including the implementation code) will be pretty easy to understand; I&rsquo;m
currently cleaning up and refactoring the source code to get rid of all the cruft left over from development.
</p>

<p>
I think there is a very felicitous side-effect of all this, which is that the Bazel build program makes the build
structure very clear and pretty simple, and Bazel features (like querying) make it very easy to explore and
experiment. So much so that I can envision that it could be used in introductory OCaml material.  Why not use the
source code of the compiler itself to learn not only how to program in OCaml but how to organize and manage code?
</p>

<p>
To <i>use</i> a compiler built using these rules one could write some installation rules, or in a Bazel-based project use
a toolchain that depends on it (rather than an OPAM-installed compiler, which is what rules_ocaml currently uses.)

The Multicore merge is behind us now. We are in the final preparation stages for 5.0 (but by no means the end of the
Multicore-related work, many things were left to do in 5.1 and further releases). The non-Multicore-development has
been restarting slowly but surely.

We&rsquo;re starting up the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/projects/modular-macros/">modular macros</a> work at Cambridge
again, with the aim of adding support for typed, hygienic, compile-time computation to OCaml.  Back in 2015 we
presented our original design at the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop, and we subsequently went on to develop a
prototype in a branch of the OCaml compiler.  We&rsquo;re planning to complete, formalise, and fully implement the design
in the coming months.

Various bits of house-keeping on the compiler distribution have been managed for 5.0, taking advantage of the major
version increment. All the compiler&rsquo;s C symbols are now prefixed <code>caml_</code>, vastly reducing the risks of conflicts
with other libraries (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10926">10926</a> and
#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11336">11336</a>). The 5.x compiler now installs all of its additional libraries
(Unix, Str, etc.) to separate directories, with a friendly warning that you need to specify <code>-I +unix</code> etc. which
makes life slightly easier for build systems (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11198">11198</a>) and the compiler
now also ships <code>META</code> files for all its libraries by default (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11007">11007</a>
and #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11399">11399</a>). Various other bits of 5.0-related poking include a
deprecation to allow the possibility in future for sub-commands to the <code>ocaml</code> command. Instead of <code>ocaml script</code>,
one should now write <code>ocaml ./script</code> (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11253">11253</a>). The compiler&rsquo;s
bootstrap process (this is the mechanism which updates the initial compiler in <code>boot/ocamlc</code> which is used to build
the compiler &ldquo;from cold&rdquo;) is now reproducible (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11149">11149</a>), easing the
review process for pull requests which need to include changes to the boot compiler. Previously we required a core
developer to re-do the bootstrap and then separately merge the work, where now a core developer can merely pull the
branch and check that the committed artefact is reproducible.

Looking beyond the release of OCaml 5.0, I&rsquo;ve also been working to resurrect the disabled Cygwin port of OCaml
(#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11642">11642</a>) and, more importantly, getting the MSVC native Windows port
working again (that&rsquo;s still WIP!).
</p>

<p>
At the OCaml Workshop this year, I demonstrated my &ldquo;relocatable compiler&rdquo; project, which aims both to eliminate
various kinds of &ldquo;papercut&rdquo; when using bytecode executables but, much more importantly, allows compiler
installations to be copied to new locations and still work, which paves the way for faster creation of opam switches
<span class="underline">everywhere</span>. It was great to be able to meet so many people in person in Slovenia for the first in-person workshop
since 2019, but unfortunately that came at the cost of catching COVID, which has slowed me down for the weeks since!
The next stage for the relocatable compiler is to have an opam remote which can be added to allow opt-in testing of
it with OCaml 4.08-5.0 and then to start opening pull requests hopefully for inclusion of the required changes in
OCaml 5.1 or 5.2.

The bulk of my upstream work over the last year in OCaml 5.0 has been on Runtime Events, a new tracing and metrics

We have continued our work on refactoring the type checker for clarity and abstraction.
An interesting result was PR #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11027">11027</a>: separate typing of
counter-examples from <code>Typecore.type_pat</code>. Namely, around 2015 <code>type_pat</code> was converted to CPS style to allow a more
refined way to check the exhaustiveness of GADT pattern-matching. A few more changes made the code more and more
complex, but last year in #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10311">10311</a> we could extract a lot of code as
case-specific constraints. This in turn made possible separating <code>type_pat</code> into two functions: <code>type_pat</code> itself,
only used to type patterns in the source program, which doesn&rsquo;t need backtracking, and <code>check_counter_example_pat</code>,
a much simpler function which works on counter examples generated by the exhaustiveness checker.
I have also added a <code>-safer-matching</code> flag for people who don&rsquo;t want the correctness of compilation to depend on the
subtle typing arguments involved in this analysis (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10834">10834</a>).
In another direction, we have reorganized the representation of type parameter variances, to make the lattice
involved more explicit (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11018">11018</a>).
We have a few PRs waiting for merging: #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11536">11536</a> introduces some wrapper
functions for level management in types, #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11569">11569</a> removes the encoding
used to represent the path of hash-types associated with a class, as it was not used in any meaningful way.

There are also a large number of bug fixes (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10738">10738</a>,

#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11648">11648</a>). The most interesting of them is
#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11648">11648</a>, which extends <code>type_desc</code> to allow keeping expansions inside
types. This is needed to fix a number of bugs, including #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9314">9314</a>, but
the change is invasive, and reviewing may take a while.

@nojb Nicolás Ojeda Bär has done very nice work on using tail-modulo-cons for some List functions of the standard
library, which I helped review along with Xavier Leroy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11362">11362</a>: List.map, List.mapi, List.map2</li>
<li>#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11402">11402</a>: List.init, List.filter, List.filteri, List.filter_map</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of those functions were hand-optimized to use non-tail-rec code on small inputs. Nicolás&rsquo; micro-benchmarks
showed that often the TMC-transformed version was a bit slower on very small lists, up to 20% slower on lists of
less than five elements. We wanted to preserve the performance of the existing code exactly, so we did some manual
unrollling in places. (The code is a bit less readable than the obvious versions, but much more readable than was
there before.)
</p>

<p>
I worked on fixing a 5.0 performance regression for bytecode-compiled programs (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11337">11337</a> ). I started with the intuition that the overhead came from
having a concurrent skip list in the 5.x runtime instead of a non-concurrent skip list in the 4.x runtime, and wrote
tricky code to use a sequential skip list again. Soon I found out that the performance regression was due to
something completely different and had to dive into the minor-root-scanning code.
</p>

<p>
When I started looking at the multicore runtime, I had no idea how to print a backtrace from a C segfault without
using <code>valgrind</code>. I wrote some documentation on debugging in
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/8796a4f4f0e4450795ee0bae2fb5bb32d313e5c7/runtime/HACKING.adoc">runtime/HACKING.adoc</a>

I spent some time reading <code>lambda/switch.ml</code>, which compiles shallow-match-on-constructor-tags into conditionals and
jump tables. The file contains some references to research papers from the 90s, but it was unclear to me how they
connected to the implementation. After a nice discussion with Luc Maranget I could propose a documentation PR

Guillaume worked on updating the &ldquo;GC timing hooks&rdquo; and <code>caml_scan_roots_hook</code> of the OCaml runtime to be
multicore-safe, and added a new hook <code>caml_domain_terminated_hook</code>.
(#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10965">10965</a>, #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11209">11209</a>) We
rely on runtime hooks in our experimental <a href="https://gitlab.com/ocaml-rust/ocaml-boxroot/">boxroot</a> library, and
updating hooks for 5.0 was necessary to have a correct 5.0 version of boxroots.
</p>

<p>
Also related to our boxroot experiments, Guillaume wanted an efficient way to check whether a domain thread was
currently holding its runtime lock &#x2013; it does not when executing long non-OCaml computations that do not access the
OCaml runtime. Guillaume changed the <code>Caml_state</code> macro to provoke an error when accessing the domain state without
holding the domain runtime lock &#x2013; a programming mistake that could easily go unnoticed before in simple testing and
crash in hard-to-debug ways on different inputs &#x2013; and introduced a new <code>Caml_state_opt</code> macro that is NULL when the
runtime lock is not held. (#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11138">11138</a>,
#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11272">11272</a>, #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11506">11506</a>).

Guillaume worked on quality treatment of asynchronous actions in the new Multicore runtime.
(#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10915">10915</a>, #<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11039">11039</a>,

#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11190">11190</a>). Asynchronous actions are callbacks called by an OCaml
program by the environment (instead of an explicit request by the programmer at the point they happen). They include
for example signal handlers, finalizers called by the GC, Statmemprof callbacks. Supporting them well requires
tricky code, because the runtime must ensure that such actions are executed promptly, but in a context where running
OCaml code is safe. (For example it is easy to have bugs where a asynchronous action raises an exception in the
middle of a runtime function that is not exception-safe.) The 4.x runtime had a lot of asynchronous-action fixes
between 4.10 and 4.14, but sadly many of these improvements were not backported in the Multicore branch (they
required expert adaptation to a very different runtime codebase), and were thus lost in the Multicore merge. The
present work tries to come back to a good state for 5.0 and 5.1 &#x2013; some of the fixes were unfortunately not merged
in time for 5.0. Statmemprof support is currently disabled for 5.x, and this work will also be useful for
Statmemprof.

<h4 id="org054682c">Memory model</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org054682c">
<p>
In a discussion in a conference call with OCaml developers shortly after the merge (to which I was invited thanks to
@kayceesrk), I was asking whether the accesses to the OCaml heap from C (runtime, VM and FFI) should not be made
atomic. At the time, the C parts of the runtime were accessing the OCaml heap through non-atomic loads and stores.
(More generally, adapting the OCaml runtime and existing FFI code to multicore requires explaining first how to
implement the OCaml memory model in the C memory model.) I do not remember the exact wording (and I would not be
able to quote it given that the meeting was unfortunately non-public), but I remember that the answer did not
convince me.
</p>

<p>
I later came back with concrete examples of undefined behaviour involving the <code>Field</code> macro
(#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10992">10992</a>). This put it back on the radar and enabled OCaml developers
to start addressing this issue. Unfortunately, it appears that the question of the OCaml memory model for C code
will still not be clarified as of 5.0.
</p>

<p>
The challenge is finding a good balance between backwards-compatibility, efficiency and standards-compliance. A
first part was addressed by marking accesses via the <code>Field</code> macro <code>volatile</code>
(#<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11255">11255</a>). The C <code>volatile</code> keyword does not imply atomicity according
to the standard, but it is used in many legacy codebases in this way, so this is likely to work while remaining
(mostly) backwards-compatible. (To my knowledge only <code>Field</code> which I gave as an example has been fixed. I suggested
that all runtime, VM and FFI API should be reviewed in the new light, but I am not aware that developers had the
time to do this yet. Similarly, user C code that is not using strictly the documented FFI and instead relies on
knowledge of the OCaml value representation in order to access values, will have to be audited before any use inside
multicore programs.)
</p>

<p>
Another issue still to be addressed is synchronizing the read of initial writes to values, as needed for memory
safety (this problem does not appear in the PLDI2018 paper, because it does not accurately model initial writes).
Even leaving backwards-compatibility for the FFI aside, using <code>memory_order_acquire</code> on mutable loads would be cheap
on x86-64 but expensive on Arm. Instead, OCaml relies on some other order-preserving property that comes for free on
Arm (address dependency). Now, C compilers do not understand this notion yet (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00854v5">McKenney
2017</a>), let alone let OCaml offer a backwards-compatible and standards-compliant
solution.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10992#issuecomment-1112394309">One solution</a> which @kayceesrk and I proposed involves requiring users to change reads of mutable fields to using a different dedicated function or macro (doing an acquire atomic load), with some provisions that they can adapt their program to multicore gradually (e.g. legacy code still works due to absence of races/parallelism). (This is a milder situation in terms of backwards-compatibility than the one with the original concurrent multicore GC that led to its abandonment in favour of the stop-the-world design.)</li>

<li>Another path I proposed was to rely on <span class="underline">de facto</span> preservation of dependency ordering by current compilers (modulo a certain number of constraints and fingers-crossings), taking inspiration from the &ldquo;Linux Kernel memory model&rdquo; (which as it names does not indicate, denotes the absence of one); and to subsequently work towards specifying what this means in terms of OCaml&rsquo;s requirements. This would be the ideal approach, because it does not require legacy programs to be fixed. I had the chance to discuss this approach with @stedolan in Ljubljana in September, and without entering into technical details, one conclusion was that it was possibly interesting work, but very hypothetical. Moreover, other users of dependency ordering (e.g. Linux RCU) have different requirements, and are currently pushing propositions to evolve C/C++ that are going in directions that are not necessarily suited to OCaml&rsquo;s needs on this issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The risk is that OCaml programs end up in a no-man&rsquo;s-land in terms of C standards due to the <code>volatile</code> fix working
well enough (so far; as far as we know; etc.), and this even in the event where a purely standards-compliant
solution was later adopted by OCaml (but where users would lack motivation to adapt their code).
</p>

<p>
This issue has not received as much discussion as I had hoped; there was no feedback on the solutions.
Unfortunately, this problem not being addressed for 5.0 means that OCaml developers might be envisioning breaking
FFI changes later on, including changes that could cause API breakages in the multicore OCaml-Rust interface which I
have been working on.

<h4 id="org8b38881">Lazy in multicore</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8b38881">
<p>
I came up with a design for thread-safe Lazys in multicore that would allow various efficient (and custom)
synchronization schemes
(<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/750#issuecomment-978125441">ocaml-multicore#750</a>) and I
started to implement a prototype. Lazy is currently thread-unsafe in multicore (although memory-safe); thread-safe
lazys would allow to implement optimally globals with delayed initialization, one common and convenient form of
synchronization in multithreaded languages (cf. &ldquo;magic statics&rdquo; in C++11, lazy statics in Rust), along with more
forms of lazy that are useful in theory but that have not been tried in practice yet.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately there is a tedious <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11182#issuecomment-1098275032">bootstrapping
issue</a> with my prototype, and I have not made
progress since (help is welcome). Another lack of motivation comes from the fact that the lazy short-cutting has
been removed in OCaml 4.14 for fear it was too expensive for GC marking. If not for short-cutting, it would be
possible to implement lazy in a much simpler way directly in OCaml. So the runtime is currently in a weird state
where 95% of the invasive work to have the short-cutting optimization is still there, but the optimization is not
done (actually, only happens for lazys that are forced while still young). Luckily, a side-effect of my work
presented at the OCaml workshop is to show that lazy short-cutting comes essentially for free during GC marking
thanks to instruction-level parallelism on modern processors, so I expect the core OCaml developers to put it back
in.

@gasche&rsquo;s original message mentioned my work on restoring some safety guarantees of asynchronous callbacks in OCaml
multicore. It is in fact a spin-off of past work where I aimed to show that it is possible to mix certain systems
programming requirements (correctly releasing resources and handling errors) with certain functional programming
requirements (being able to interrupt computation asynchronously), given the right language design. (My work on
memprof-limits was another part of this work.) AFAIU OCaml multicore was originally developed with the idea that it
is not really possible to handle asynchronous interruptions nicely at a language-design level, which explains that
they were given second-class status in the new runtime, despite many existing programs using them.
</p>

<p>
The work on Boxroot presented with @gasche at the ML workshop is meant to enable the development of safe interfaces
between OCaml and Rust. I am working on such an interface for multicore OCaml to serve as a common building block
for the few other projects in this area, by giving a reference implementation of the multicore memory-safety model.
We also opened an RFC opening the possibility to integrate Boxroot with the OCaml runtime, but there are a few
things to clarify before this can be considered.
</p>

<p>
At the OCaml workshop I presented an implementation in the runtime of a large page allocator with support for huge
pages (THP) and efficient pointer classification (i.e. what you need to point to dynamically-allocated memory in the
GC heap with sharing-like properties, à la Ancient and OCamlnet). It is part of longer-term goals, along with
Boxroot, aiming to show how it is possible to mix tracing GC with the idea of <span class="underline">linear allocation with re-use</span> coming
from linear logic (a.k.a. &ldquo;functional but in place&rdquo; in recent papers). (Such a hybrid allocation scheme could open
now possibilities in programming for large data or low latency requirements in functional programming.) This is
loosely inspired by old papers by Jean-Yves Girard on mixing linear, intuitionistic and classical reasoning inside
the same deductive system.
</p>

<p>
All this is part of a longer-term investigation into the mixing of systems and functional programming centred on the
notion of resource as a first-class value. (I have various ideas in this area ranging from hands-on to very
theoretical; students in France or in Cambridge UK should feel free to get in touch with me if they are interested
overall by this subject.)

<p>
My understanding of this issue is as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>None of the core developers is actively working on multicore lazy, so you would probably have to contribute yourself if you want to improve them. (I have on the occasion tried to help you along, and would be happy to do it again, but right now I would rather focus on boxroot.)</li>
<li>The reason why shortcutting was disabled is the interaction with GC prefetching which, as you explain, is currently missing from Multicore. Prefetching is important for performance in 4.x, and Jane Street would like to see it back in 5.x as well. Someone at Tarides is working on this (I don&rsquo;t know who, KC would). So it sounds likely that prefetching will make a comeback for 5.x, and one would have to adapt the implementation again to work with lazy shortcutting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You posted your patch to the prefetching code to re-enable lazy shortcutting in
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/750#issuecomment-986847502">https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/750#issuecomment-986847502</a>, with preliminary benchmarks
suggesting that it does not decrease the performance of marking. On the same issue, @lpw25 wondered whether we
really need shortcutting (what lazy-using programs actually depend on it for performance), suggesting that it is not
a high-priority issue.
</p>

<p>
One difficulty that I foresee is that there is no one strongly pushing for lazy shortcutting to come back (this
somewhat supports Leo&rsquo;s point), and at the same time it is hard to convince the Jane Street people that the
prefetching change you suggest is innocuous for their workflows (because only they can run the benchmarks they care
about, and apparently they are not motivated enough by this issue to run them with your patch).

<p>
The Jane Street compilers team is hard at work on a number of fronts, though perhaps less visibly than in the past.
Previously, we worked on a feature and got it merged upstream without releasing it internally. This meant that our
colleagues would have to wait for a main trunk release of OCaml before getting the new feature, a turnaround time
that was sometimes too slow. In order to decrease latency between feature conception and use, we have now changed to
a new workflow where we develop and release features internally while we work to upstream.
</p>

<p>
Not only does this new workflow get features into the hands of our developers faster, it also allows us to improve
the final product:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The upstreaming discussion can be informed by actual practice by the 700+ OCaml developers within Jane Street. We can, for example, examine developer adoption rates and performance impact with ease.</li>
<li>Because we can access the entire code base where a feature is deployed, we can correct design mistakes with low cost. For example, if a feature proves too confusing to use in practice, we can change its syntax. Indeed, Jane Street regularly makes broad updates to its code base, and this kind of change fits within our workflow. For main-trunk OCaml, this means that features are more fully tested than they could be otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Upstreaming &#x2013; contributing back to an open-source project and working in a language that reaches beyond our walls
&#x2013; remains a core value for the compilers team. (Indeed, one of my explicit job responsibilities at Jane Street is
to help facilitate this process.) In addition, all our compiler work is fully
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst">open-source</a>.
</p>

<p>
That said, we have a number of features we&rsquo;re excited to share progress on, listed below. Expect to see proper
proposals for these (posted to the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs">RFCs repo</a>) in due course.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/tree/main/jane/doc">Local allocations</a></b>, implemented by Stephen Dolan
and Leo White. This adds support for stack-allocated blocks, enforcing memory safety by requiring that
heap-allocated blocks never point to stack-allocated blocks (and stack-allocated blocks never point to shorter-lived
stack-allocated blocks). Function arguments can be annotated as <code>local_</code> to say that the function does not store
that argument. For example,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ocaml"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">val</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">map</span> : 'a list -&gt; <span style="color: #00824f;">f</span>:local_ ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b list
</pre>
</div>

<p>
says that <code>map</code> does not store the function it is passed anywhere in the output, allowing the function closure to be
stack-allocated. Stack-allocated record, variants, etc., are also possible. See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGRn5ZIbEW8">Stephen Dolan&rsquo;s talk at
ML&rsquo;22</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is a large addition to OCaml&rsquo;s type system, and we&rsquo;re still learning about how to use it best. We are actively
learning from its deployment within Jane Street to influence the final version of this feature for upstreaming.
</p>

<p>
<b><code>include functor</code></b>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/pull/32">implemented</a> by Chris Casinghino. This
syntactic extension allows a module to include the results of applying a functor to the prefix of the module already
written. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ocaml"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">module type</span> <span style="color: #444fcf;">Indexed_collection</span> = <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">sig</span>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #444fcf;">'a t</span>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">val</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">mapi</span> : 'a t -&gt; <span style="color: #00824f;">f</span>:(int -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b t
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">end</span>

  <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">val</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">map</span> : 'a <span style="color: #444fcf;">M.</span>t -&gt; <span style="color: #00824f;">f</span>:('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b <span style="color: #444fcf;">M.</span>t
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">end</span> = <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">struct</span>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">let</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">map</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">t</span> ~<span style="color: #007a9f;">f</span> = <span style="color: #444fcf;">M.</span>mapi t <span style="color: #00824f;">~f</span>:(<span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">fun</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">_</span> -&gt; f)

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Despite being &ldquo;just&rdquo; a syntactic convenience, this has already received wide uptake within Jane Street.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comprehensions</b>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/pull/46">implemented</a> by Antal Spector-Zabusky. This
adds support for both list and array comprehensions, such as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ocaml"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">let</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">pythagorean_triples_up_to</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">n</span> =
  [ a,b,c
    <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">for</span> a = <span style="color: #00824f;">1</span> <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">to</span> n
    <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">for</span> b = a <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">to</span> n
    <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">for</span> c = b <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">to</span> n
    <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">when</span> a * a + b * b = c * c ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The feature works similarly for arrays, with <code>[| ... |]</code> syntax.
</p>

<p>
<b>Immutable arrays</b>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/pull/47">implemented</a> by Antal Spector-Zabusky.
This adds support for immutable arrays. These are just like normal arrays, but immutability ensures that the
contents of the array do not change.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unboxed types</b>, with a very early <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/pull/48">implementation</a> by Chris
Casinghino and <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/34">proposal</a> by me (with the help of my colleagues). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV-4Xddk0Yc">Stephen
Dolan</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vevld4cXSYk">and I</a> have given
talks about the design.
</p>

<p>
Currently, all variables and fields must store values that are stored in a single machine word (e.g. 64 bits);
furthermore, this word must either be a pointer to garbage-collected memory or have its bottom bit tagged to denote
that the garbage collector should skip it. Unboxed types relax this restriction, allowing a single variable or field
to hold structures smaller or larger than a word, or store a word that the garbage collector will know not to scan.
In so doing, unboxed types effectively allow records and variants to be inlined into one another, enabling
programmers to structure their compile-time abstractions differently than their run-time memory layout.
</p>

<p>
The core innovation is the notion of a <i>layout</i>, which classifies a type (much like a type classifies a value). A
layout describes how a value should be stored and whether it can be examined by the garbage collector. By assigning
layouts to abstract types and type variables, we can abstract over non-word layouts. Much more is in the
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/34">proposal</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Polymorphic parameters</b>, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst/pull/14">implemented</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/lpw25/ocaml-jst/blob/poly-param2/jane/doc/polymorphic-parameters.md">documented</a> by Leo White.
This feature allows function parameters to have polymorphic types. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ocaml"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">let</span> <span style="color: #a7601f;">select</span>
  : 'b 'c. <span style="color: #007a9f;">selector</span>:<span style="color: #444fcf;">('a. ('a * 'a) -&gt; 'a) -&gt; ('b * 'b) list -&gt; ('c * 'c) list -&gt; ('b * 'c) list</span>
<span style="color: #444fcf;">  </span>= <span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">fun</span> ~<span style="color: #007a9f;">selector</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">bbs</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">ccs</span> -&gt;
    <span style="color: #444fcf;">List.</span>map2 (<span style="color: #006f00; font-weight: bold;">fun</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">bb</span> <span style="color: #007a9f;">cc</span> -&gt; selector bb, selector cc) bbs ccs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>select</code> function chooses either the first components or the second components of the input lists to comprise
the output list. The <code>selector</code> function must be polymorphic, because the elements in the pairs in the input lists
may have different types. (Note that <code>'b</code> and <code>'c</code> are universally quantified in the type of <code>select</code>, so we know
that the type checker does not unify them.)

<h3 id="org290706f">Anurag Soni announced</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org290706f">
<p>
I&rsquo;d like to announce the initial release of <a href="https://github.com/anuragsoni/http_async">http_async</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Http_async</b>: provides a HTTP/1.1 web server for <a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/async/">async</a>.
</p>

<p>
The library started life as a wrapper around httpaf, but has evolved over time to be a standalone implementation of
an HTTP/1.1 server. It implements its own parser that works on big strings and is reasonably fast. The library
supports the common use-cases of connection pipelining, streaming request and response bodies. Servers can be run on
both IP and Unix domain sockets, and ships with optional <code>Core.Command</code> entry points.
</p>

<p>
The implementation initially started as a testing ground for my I/o library
<a href="https://github.com/anuragsoni/shuttle">shuttle</a>, but I&rsquo;ve been happy enough with the resulting api that I intend to
support this as a standalone library moving forward. As far as performance is concerned, I always recommend doing
your own tests with workloads that are closer to the intended use, but in my tests the performance seems very
reasonable. There is a version of http_async that&rsquo;s part of the http benchmarks run for the multicore project and
the results looked fairly decent when compared to other single threaded runtimes (see
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/retro-httpaf-bench/pull/24">https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/retro-httpaf-bench/pull/24</a> for more details)

<span style="color: #ff4500;">;;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The library doesn&rsquo;t ship with any routers, or a middleware composition API with the intention that those will be
layers that will live as a separate library. It should be easy to plug this into a third party routing library like
<code>ocaml-dispatch</code> or <code>routes</code>. Some examples can be seen at:
<a href="https://github.com/anuragsoni/http_async/tree/main/example">https://github.com/anuragsoni/http_async/tree/main/example</a> and
