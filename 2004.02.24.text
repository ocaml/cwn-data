Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, for the week of 17 to 24 February, 2004.

1) problems with caml-list
2) mod_caml question
3) Embedding OCaml
4) ocamldbi 0.9.0 and mod_caml 1.1.0
5) Request for more String functions
6) GtkSpell binding

========================================================================
1) problems with caml-list
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Xavier Leroy explained:

This is a list administration message:

Due to an incorrect mail filtering rule recently triggered by a
software update on INRIA's mail exchangers, all messages posted to
caml-list@inria.fr the last week or so were not distributed to the
list, and were actually lost.  (For a while, I thought everyone was
just unusually quiet :-)

I hope this problem is now fixed.  Profuse apologies for the
inconvenience.
    
========================================================================
2) mod_caml question
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Ranjan Bagchi asked and Richard Jones explained:

It's simply there to workaround a problem with Dynlink.

In brief when you use Dynlink, it tries to read your current
executable to find the symbol table in the bytecode.  This way it can
find out what symbols are already part of the environment.

Of course there are all sorts of problems with doing this in a Unix
environment: eg. you might, quite legitimately, have unlink(2)ed the
executable, so it no longer exists.  Or you might not have read
permission on your own executable.  Or you might not be able to find
the path to your own executable (think chroot(2), or being passed a
non-standard argv or PATH).  etc.

The problem with mod_caml is that there's no executable at all,
because the module is dynamically linked (using dlopen(3)) into
Apache.  Thus we have to go through some hoops to build a fake
executable and tell Dynlink to use this to find its symbol table.
This is the purpose of the code in mod_caml_c:init().

3) Embedding OCaml
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have a look at this posting:

<http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200308/msg00258.html>

> I use Dynalink pacjage for dynamically loading object .cmo files.

Dynlink is very fussy.  I had lots of problems with it.  You might
like to look at mod_caml for ideas.

Sure, sorry

** Clément Capel also answered:

I have got another solution to possibly resolve this
problem:
I've developed an embedded O'Caml toplevel
which integrates the runtime and the compiler of O'Caml.
Actually, it's a dynamic linked library (in C) builds using
the "ouput-obj" option; i have solved the problem of
the symbole table thanks to a modification of the
compiler and the runtime.

you can download the patch at this url:
<http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~capel/eng/toplevel/toplevel.html>

you will find also an O'Caml plugin for Excel and Netscape in this page.


Just an example to show you how it works (in C):
(you can also use the directives #use and #load)

  toplevel_init(argv);

  toplevel_exec("let rec ack m n =
                 match m,n with 0,n -> n+1
               | m,0 -> ack (m-1) 1
               | m,n -> (ack (m-1) ack m (n-1))");

  val = toplevel_exec("ack 3 2;;");
  res = 1+Long_val(val);

  printf ("1+ack(3,2)=%dn", res);


I hope it will help you.
    
========================================================================
4) ocamldbi 0.9.0 and mod_caml 1.1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Richard Jones announced:

I'm pleased to announce that the DBI (database layer) part of mod_caml
has now been split into a separate library, so you can try it out
independently of mod_caml itself.  You can find both packages in the
mod_caml CVS repository:

<http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/>

Or you can check them out of CVS by following the instructions on this
page, under the heading "Anonymous CVS Access":

<https://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=modcaml>

(I haven't built tarballs at the moment, because it's all somewhat
experimental)
    
========================================================================
5) Request for more String functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Dustin Sallings and Richard Jones asked (for some string functions), and Shawn Wagner announced:

> > val split_chars : string -> char list -> int -> string list
> > val strstr : string -> string -> int -> int
> > val ends_with : string -> string -> bool

<Plug> Many of these (And everything the OP asked for, though I had to add
some of them just now) are in my extlib library
(<http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/extlib/>), though under different names.
It's a collection of things that would be useful in the standard libraries
that come with ocaml, but aren't there. I keep adding to it all the time
(Also just added the getpgid/setpgid functions also just requested on the
list).

This one's in it too.

========================================================================
6) GtkSpell binding
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Shawn Wagner announced:


GtkSpell (<http://gtkspell.sf.net>) is a library for doing on-the-fly spell
checking in gtk text widgets. I've whipped up bindings to use it with
lablgtk2.

See <http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/lablgtkspell/> for source, docs, etc.

It was interesting, because I've never looked at how lablgtk2 works under
the hood (Just using the high-level objects), and now had to get at the
actual C pointers of things. Happily, it turned out to be easy to figure
out from the source. :)
    
========================================================================
Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'<1':1
zM
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

========================================================================
Old cwn
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to miss a CWN, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@polytechnique.org) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/>) or the RSS feed of the
archives (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/cwn.rss>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, you may subscribe online at
