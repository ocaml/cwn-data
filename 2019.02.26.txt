Thierry Martinez announced
──────────────────────────

  We are happy to announce the first public beta of the new clangml
  library. Clangml provides bindings for all versions of Clang, from 3.4
  to 8.0.0.

  In particular, Clangml allows OCaml program to use the Clang parser to
  parse C/C++ code and get an abstract syntax tree annotated with type
  information.

  clangml can be installed via opam. Since the library relies on
  external dependencies, we suggest to use the depext plugin to install
  it together with the packages needed for your system:

  ┌────
  │ opam depext -i clangml
  └────

  This library is a complete rewritting of the previous clangml (clangml
  versions <4.0.0): the bindings now rely on automatically generated C
  stubs to libclang, with some extensions when libclang is incomplete.

  Contrary to old clangml versions, the versions of clangml from 4.0.0
  are independent from the version of the Clang library: any version of
  clangml from 4.0.0 can be built with any version of the Clang library
  in the supported interval.  Currently, all versions of Clang, from 3.4
  to 8.0.0, are supported.
