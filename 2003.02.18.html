Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, week 11 to 18 February, 2003.

1) <a href="#1">CamlAgent 0.1</a>
2) <a href="#2">Optimizing false polymorphic local functions</a>
3) <a href="#3">Any idea about Ocaml 3.07 release date?</a>

1) CamlAgent 0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SooHyoung Oh announced:

CamlAgent version 0.1
 - Ocaml applications for Microsoft Agent: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msagent">http://www.microsoft.com/msagent</a>
 - You can see parallel and sequential agent play.
 - Home: <a href="http://www.taglib.co.kr/ocaml/camlAgent.html">http://www.taglib.co.kr/ocaml/camlAgent.html</a>

Requirements:
 * MS agent characters
    - In download page, you can find
       = MS Agent core components
       = MS Agent character files: Genie, Merlin, Peedy, Robby
 * MS Visual C++ Compiler / MS Visual Studio
    - I tested on MS Visual Studio .Net.
 * Ocaml 3.06
 * Lablgtk 1.2.5 - you can source and binary in
  <a href="http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html">http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html</a>
 * camlidl 1.04
 * camlidl 1.04 patch - I made some patches for MS agent ONLY.

Demos:
 - move: moveSquare, moveCircle
 - hello: parallel, sequential play

2) Optimizing false polymorphic local functions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pascal Zimmer asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; The other day, I ran into a significant speedup improvement.
&gt; Here is a simpler (and artificial) version:
&gt; 
&gt; let min_list l =
&gt;  let rec loop mini = function
&gt;     [] -&gt; mini
&gt;   | (x::r) -&gt; loop (if x &lt;= mini then x else mini) r
&gt;  in loop max_int l;;
&gt; 
&gt; This function computes the minimal element of an int list. Note however
&gt; that the inner local function "loop" is polymorphic.
&gt; 
&gt; Now consider the slightly different version where "loop" is forced into
&gt; a monomorphic function:
&gt; 
&gt; let min_list l =
&gt;  let rec loop (mini:int) = function
&gt;     [] -&gt; mini
&gt;   | (x::r) -&gt; loop (if x &lt;= mini then x else mini) r
&gt;  in loop max_int l;;
&gt; 
&gt; On my computer in native code, the speedup is really significant: more
&gt; than 6 times faster (OK this example was built on purpose...). The
&gt; reason is that in the first case, the operator &lt;= is replaced by a call
&gt; to the internal polymorphic compare_val function, whereas is the second
&gt; case a direct comparison between integers is performed.
&gt; Note also that if you replace the "if" statement by "min x mini", you
&gt; don't get any speedup because the polymorphic function "min" is called
&gt; in any case.
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect there are other cases in which the compiler can produce a
&gt; better code when it knows more precisely the types involved. 

Yes: besides comparisons, array and bigarray accesses can be compiled
more efficiently if the exact types of the data are known statically.

&gt; So my question is: would it be possible to help him in this way by
&gt; enforcing the type checker to infer a monomorphic type in such  
&gt; situations ? By "such situations", I mean: local polymorphic
&gt; functions that are used in exactly one monomorphic setting
&gt; afterwards. Of course, this is not desirable for global functions,
&gt; since it may break the calculus; but for local functions, it should 
&gt; be of no harm since we know all the places where they are used, and
&gt; it would not change the type of the wrapper, thus being transparent
&gt; for the user...
&gt; Any comment ?

The following paper formalizes exactly this idea, and gives a type
inference algorithm that avoids unecessary polymorphism like you suggest:

3) Any idea about Ocaml 3.07 release date?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alessandro Baretta wondered and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; I am wondering whether the Ocaml team has any idea about the 
&gt; next release date. Any ideas?

Certainly not before late April, and hopefully no later than early July.
I can't be any more precise than this at the moment.

If you happen to miss a cwn, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@inria.fr) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/</a>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
