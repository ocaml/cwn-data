      <cwn_title>new versions of VS Code extensions Alcotest and Expect and Inline tests, now on Open VSX too</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-versions-of-vs-code-extensions-alcotest-and-expect-inline-tests-now-on-open-vsx-too/11700/2</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Roland Csaszar announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
New versions for both extensions that fix a critical bug: until now if there had been more than one test runner the
tests from all other runners had been deleted during test discovery.

Important feature added to the Expect and Inline extension: on startup and ~Refresh Tests~ now the tests are not
run, but only a list of tests is generated. This speeds up test discovery significantly (and now both extensions
work the same).

*** Alcotest Test Explorer Version 0.6.0

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)

**** Changelog

- Make the path to the Dune executable configurable. Can now be either an absolute path, a path relative to the project root or just ~dune~, which is looked up in the local Opam environment or the ~PATH~.
- Add a message window to ask for a reload if a configuration value has changed.
- Update documentation

**** Bugfixes

- Do not delete the test groups of all other test runners if there exists more than one test runner.

*** Expect and Inline Tests Version 0.5.0

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)

**** Changelog

- No need to run all tests at startup or refresh. Use the ~-list-test-names~ argument of the inline test runners.
- New configuration values:
  * ~expectppx.discoverInSources~ - Whether to parse source files on open and save for tests and update the Test Explorer tree. Should be set to ~true~ if ~expectppx.discoverOnStartup~ is ~false~.
  * ~expectppx.dunePath~ - Set an absolute path or a path relative to the project root of the Dune executable. Default: ~dune~ - use the one in the local Opam environment or in ~PATH~. See [Issue #3](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline/issues/3).
  * ~expectppx.excludeRunners~ - A list of inline test runner names to be excluded from test discovery an startup or refresh, e.g. because they take too long to finish.
- Add a message window to ask for a reload if a configuration value has changed.
- Disable ANSI color escape sequences in output of test failures.
- Update the documentation.

**** Bugfixes

- Fix bug when tests from other test runners are deleted on startup or refresh having more than one inline test runner. See [Issue #3](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline/issues/3).

**** Internal Changes

- Remove ANSI escape sequences from test fixtures.
- Add yarn target for the Open VSX Registry.

      <cwn_who>Roland Csaszar later announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I've just released a new version of the Expect testing extension. The Expect test result of a failed test now uses
VS Code's diff view. The actual result output of the test can be displayed by hovering the stanza
~let%expect_test~.

*** Expect and Inline Tests Version 0.6.0

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline)

**** Changelog

- Show the expected and actual values of Expect tests in VS Codes' diff view. See [Issue #6](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline/issues/6).
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Roland Csaszar finally announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
These releases of both extensions provide better handling of Dune locks.

The new versions fix a bug where a dune process waiting to acquire the lock couldn't be cancelled.
And after 30s of not acquiring the Dune lock an error message is displayed.

*** Alcotest Test Explorer Version 0.7.0

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=release-candidate.vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-alcotest-test-adapter)

**** Changelog

- If the dune lock can't be acquired for 30s, raise an error window and ask the user what to do.
- Update the documentation.

**** Bugfixes

- Make ~Cancel Test Run~ stop Dune processes waiting for the lock too. See [Issue #9](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-ocaml-expect-inline/issues/9).

**** Internal Changes

- Add yarn target for the Open VSX Registry.

      <cwn_title>Camomile 2.0.0 is out!</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-camomile-2-0-0-is-out/11751/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Romain Beauxis announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Camomile ~2.0.0~ is out and should be available in the ~opam~ repository.  üéâ

This releases brings compatibility with ~OCaml~ 5 to ~camomile~ and all projects using it as well as a cleanup of
the API and build system.

We have used ~camomile~ for years with ~liquidsoap~ and, after ~OCaml~ 5 came out, the library was not building
with it and appeared unmaintained. However, after looking for alternatives, it appeared that there were ‚ö†Ô∏è **no
alternatives to convert from ~UTF-8~ to outdated string encodings such as ~ISO-8859-1~** ‚ö†Ô∏è

While there are modules that allow to do the opposite, we believe that, in order to be successful and widespread,
the OCaml ecosystem needs to be able to accommodate to legacy computer systems and protocols and, in particular, be
able to output strings to legacy string encodings so we decided to see about bringing ~camomile~ up-to speed with
the latest ~OCaml~ compiler and tooling.

The fork is currently located at https://github.com/savonet/Camomile and was approved by the original author
[yoriyuki](https://discuss.ocaml.org/u/yoriyuki). We are immensely grateful for his work up-to this point.

Make no mistake, though: the module is still in dire need of maintainers. Ideally, we would like to move the module
to [ocaml-community](https://github.com/ocaml-community/meta/issues/39) and bring more people onboard to help with
it.

To reflect back to the last [actual release](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-camomile-1-0-0-is-released/1825/1),
things that should be worked on next are are least:
- split the module into several libraries, so that a user do not need to install the entire (several megabytes) libraries
- support latest Unicode standard (it is **very** outdated)

If you are interested in helping with it, please feel free to contact us or send some PRs our way!

      <cwn_title>cid 0.1.0 - Content Identifiers in OCaml</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-cid-0-1-0-content-identifiers-in-ocaml/11761/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Patrick Ferris announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm happy to announce the initial release of [cid](https://github.com/patricoferris/ocaml-cid), an OCaml library
for working with [Content Identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/). These are like your
usual hash-based identifiers used in content-addressable stores, but are built on
[multiformat](https://multiformats.io) libraries. See
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-multicodec-multibase-multihash-and-multihash-digestif/10686 for the initial release
of the OCaml versions of these libraries.

The main takeaway is that the identifiers are self-describing helping build more permanent and interoperable
content-addressed systems (e.g. they are used in the IPFS protocol).

#+begin_src ocaml
let () =
  let s = "foo" in
  let hash =
    Multihash_digestif.of_cstruct `Sha3_256 (Cstruct.of_string s)
    |> Result.get_ok
  in
  let cid = Cid.v ~version:`Cidv1 ~codec:`Raw ~base:`Base32 ~hash in
  Format.printf "Base encoded: %s\nHuman: %a"
    (Cid.to_string cid) Cid.pp_human cid

Base encoded: bafkrmidw2o6edspvrd37zugvx5drr6hyjmoedmqiqjydcafz5okbhad4ae
Human: cidv1 - base32 - raw - ident(sha3-256) length(32) digest(
76 d3 bc 41 c9 f5 88 f7  fc d0 d5 bf 47 18 f8 f8
4b 1c 41 b2 08 82 70 31  00 b9 eb 94 13 80 7c 01
)
#+end_src

There's also a small example the repository of [replacing Irmin's default hash implementation to use
cid](https://github.com/patricoferris/ocaml-cid/blob/main/test/irmin_cid.ml).

Happy Hacking :camel:

I am pleased to announce the first release of Stk, a SDL-based graphical user interface toolkit. Its interface is
inspired by Gtk and should look familiar to developers using Lablgtk.
The project page: https://zoggy.frama.io/ocaml-stk/

Chamo, a development-oriented text editor, is now based on Stk rather than Lablgtk since release 4.0.

      <cwn_title>Zanuda -- OCaml linter experiment</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-zanuda-ocaml-linter-experiment/11784/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Kakadu announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I developed [a linter](https://github.com/Kakadu/zanuda) for my FP course in my local university. It analyzed
(mostly) typed tree and performs various checks (a.k.a. lints). The list of available lints could be found
[here](https://kakadu.github.io/zanuda/lints/index.html).

The discussion about a absence of litner arise from time to time  [How possible is a clippy-like linter for
OCaml?](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/how-possible-is-a-clippy-like-linter-for-ocaml) and somewhere in [What are the
biggest reasons newcomers give up on
OCaml?](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/what-are-the-biggest-reasons-newcomers-give-up-on-ocaml/10958/299) I'm not sure
that usage of OCaml linter for non-teaching purposes is wise, but if my work will gain some traction, nobody will
be able to accuse OCaml that it doesn't have a linter.

Questions, user reports and PRs will be appreciated.
