      <cwn_title>http-multipart-formdata v3.0.1 released</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-http-multipart-formdata-v3-0-1-released/8261/2</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Continuing the thread from last week, Hannes Mehnert asked</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Thanks for your work on that. I'm curious about the different "multipart" libraries now
available for OCaml -- anyone has a brief comparison of them?

- [http-multipart-formdata](https://github.com/lemaetech/http-multipart-formdata) as announced above
- [multipart_form](https://github.com/dinosaure/multipart_form/) by @dinosaure
- [multipart-form-data](https://github.com/cryptosense/multipart-form-data) by cryptosense

Are there functional differences? Correctness? Performance? Or just a matter of style and
co-development?

      <cwn_who>Bikal Lem replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
One obvious difference among the three is ~http-multipart-formdata~ doesn't depend on any
IO/Promise libraries, such as lwt or async. so you may find it easier to integrate in your
project.

~mulitpart-form-data~ exposes a callback based streaming api, whereas http-multipart-formdata
exposes a non-callback, non-blocking based API streaming api.

The API surface of ~http-multipart-formdata~ is kept as low as possible, primarily 3 API
calls - ~boundary, reader~ and ~read~ call.

The dependency list of ~http-multipart-formdata~ is the thinnest. This may or may not be an
issue depending on your aesthetics. However, relatively/comparatively the less your
dependencies, the easier it is to integrate the lib with other OCaml libs and environments
such as various OSes.

      <cwn_who>Bikal Lem added</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I should also add ~http-multipart-formdata~ has been implemented with zero-copy streaming and
minimal allocation in mind.

We are happy to announce that the ML Family Workshop is back for its
2021 edition, which we will be held online on Thursday August 26th, in
conjunction with ICFP 2021. We invite you to subscribe to, and attend
the workshop, in addition to the main ICFP conference.

We are thrilled to announce that Don Syme will give this year's keynote:
"Narratives and Lessons from The Early History of F#". Please join us!

The program features 14 exciting submissions, including 4 short talks.
The workshop will be held online in the 6pm-3am time band (Seoul Time).
Talks will be pre-recorded and uploaded online for those who cannot attend.

      <cwn_title>Coq-of-ocaml to translate OCaml to Coq</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/coq-of-ocaml-to-translate-ocaml-to-coq/8288/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Guillaume Claret announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am pleased to present the [coq-of-ocaml](https://clarus.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/) project,
to translate a subset of OCaml to the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant. The aim
is to do formal verification on OCaml programs. The idea is to generate a Coq translation as
close as possible to the original code in terms of intent but using the Coq syntax. As a
short example, if we take the following OCaml code and run ~coq-of-ocaml~:
#+begin_src ocaml
type 'a tree =
| Leaf of 'a
| Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec sum tree =
  match tree with
  | Leaf n -> n
  | Node (tree1, tree2) -> sum tree1 + sum tree2
#+end_src
we get the following Coq file:
#+begin_src coq
Require Import CoqOfOCaml.CoqOfOCaml.
Require Import CoqOfOCaml.Settings.

Inductive tree (a : Set) : Set :=
| Leaf : a -> tree a
| Node : tree a -> tree a -> tree a.

Arguments Leaf {_}.
Arguments Node {_}.

Fixpoint sum (tree : tree int) : int :=
  match tree with
  | Leaf n => n
  | Node tree1 tree2 => Z.add (sum tree1) (sum tree2)
  end.
#+end_src

We support the following OCaml features:
- the core of OCaml (functions, let bindings, pattern-matching,...)
- type definitions (records, inductive types, synonyms, mutual types)
- monadic programs
- modules as namespaces
- modules as polymorphic records (signatures, functors, first-class modules)
- multiple-file projects (thanks to Merlin)
- both ~.ml~ and ~.mli~ files
- existential types (we use impredicative sets option in Coq)

We also have some support for the GADTs, the polymorphic variants, and the extensible types.
We are in particular working on having an axiom-free translation of the GADTs to Coq. We do
not support:
- side-effects outside of a monad (references, exceptions, ...);
- object-oriented programming;
- various combinations of OCaml features for which ~coq-of-ocaml~ should generate a warning.

Our main example and use case is the
[coq-tezos-of-ocaml](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/) project. This
contains a translation of most of the [economic
protocol](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/tree/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol) of the
[Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain (around 30.000 lines of OCaml translated to 40.000
lines of Coq). For example, we verify the comparison functions defined in
[src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/script_comparable.ml](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/script_comparable.ml)
with
[src/Proto_alpha/Proofs/Script_comparable.v](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/proofs/script_comparable).

We are looking for the application to other projects too.

We think the best way to use ~coq-of-ocaml~ is to continue developing in OCaml and run
~coq-of-ocaml~ to keep a synchronized translation in Coq. Having a working Coq translation
(as compiling in Coq) forces us to avoid some OCaml constructs. We believe these constructs
would probably be hard to verify anyway. Then, on the Coq side, we can verify some important
or easy to catch properties. If there is a regression in the OCaml code, re-running
~coq-of-ocaml~ should make the proofs break.
