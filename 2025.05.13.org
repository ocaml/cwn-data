* FlexDLL 0.44 released
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/flexdll-0-44-released/16614/1

** David Allsopp announced


I'm pleased to announce the release of [[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/releases/tag/0.44][FlexDLL 0.44]] which has just been [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/27855][merged to opam-repository]].

FlexDLL is primarily used by the mingw-w64 and MSVC versions of Windows OCaml to implement ~Dynlink~.

The release contains several bug-fixes to do with the handling of objects ([[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/issues/29][ocaml/flexdll#29]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/issues/126][ocaml/flexdll#126]] and [[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/pull/150][ocaml/flexdll#150]]),   several improvements to command line handling ([[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/pull/148][ocaml/flexdll#148]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/pull/151][ocaml/flexdll#151]] and [[https://github.com/ocaml/flexdll/pull/152][ocaml/flexdll#152]]), as well as various hardenings and improvements for cross-compiling and for use of alternate compiler toolchains.

Since FlexDLL is used by the compiler itself, the upgrade is similar in impact to a new compiler release, in that opam switches will be fully recompiled.

** Richard Degenne announced


I have a couple of ongoing side-projects that I use to practice my OCaml every now and then, whenever I have some free time. The other day, I wanted to use fixtures for a test and it took me a while to get it to work properly with Dune, so I thought it was worth a write-up!

I'm sharing it here because I would be especially interested in having some feedback from other OCaml developers, seasoned or not. <3

* OCaml support in Zed editor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-support-in-zed-editor/16623/1

** Louis Roché announced


The [[https://zed.dev/][zed editor]] is a modern and very snappy editor developped in rust. It's a bit behind more mature emacs/vim/vscode in term of features, though it's already pretty usable. There is an [[https://github.com/zed-extensions/ocaml][ocaml extension]] which I contributed to a little bit.

I'd be curious to know if other people have tried this editor and would be willing to put a little bit of work into the extension. For now I do it mostly for myself. And would probably have more motivation if I knew it's actually being used by other people too.
      



* Typesafe complicated combinations

** Continuing this thread, rand announced


To those of you interested, I updated the text with [[https://r7p5.earth/blog/2025-4-25/Typesafe%20complicated%20combinations#h-illegal-states][further discussion]] of the design-pattern - specifically about the fact that it reverses the dependency-relation between combined data, vs what one would have done by aggregating data within data. 

This is also loosely related to OO in an interesting way - in that objects in OO have identities, and *contain* data and procedures - where here it's individual data-sources (`Socket.Endpoint`s) that have identities, which are carried across different data, and finally used to combine in a typesafe way.

I would be interested to hear if anyone also has experience with related patterns, and for what? Tyxml is one example.

*** *Dune*

*Roadmap:* [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap#w4-build-a-project][Develop / (W4) Build a Project]]

Dune 3.18 brings various quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and new features. It introduces support for the new ~x-maintenance-intent~ field in opam packages, allowing maintainers to better communicate project status. The release also includes the new ~(format-dune-file ...)~ stanza, formalizing the dune format-dune-file command as an inside rule, and adds support for the ~not~ operator in package dependencies constraints. Several improvements to cache handling of file permissions have been implemented, and users can now utilize the ~--prefix~ flag when configuring dune with ~ocaml configure.ml~, providing greater installation flexibility.

From 3.18.0, Dune now uses shorter paths for inline-test artifacts, allows dash characters in project names created with ~dune init~, and displays negative error codes on Windows in hexadecimal format — the customary way to display ~NTSTATUS~ codes. The release also enhances stability with improved retry mechanisms for file delete operations on Windows under heavy load and provides better warning behavior when failing to discover the project root due to read failures, replacing the previous abort behavior.

Shortly after, Dune 3.18.1 was released with a hotfix that corrects an issue where ~pkg-config~ would fail to find certain libraries in specific contexts, while Dune 3.18.2 provides support for the upcoming OCaml 5.4 release.

**** *Dune Package Management*

As of May 9, a large part of Dune-based packages on ~opam-repository~ now build successfully with Dune package management. At [[https://dune.check.ci.dev][dune.check.ci.dev]], we provide continuous monitoring of build success across the ecosystem, giving visibility into compatibility before migration.

The effort of making Dune package management compatible with the wider OCaml ecosystem is ongoing and aims to assess when Dune package management is ready for adoption in production settings. We are committed to maintain compatibility with both opam and Dune workflows, ensuring teams can transition at their own pace with minimal disruption to existing projects

Technical barriers have been and are being systematically addressed, e.g. improved handling of ZIP archives, better dependency conflict resolution, and enhanced support for pinned packages that don't use Dune's build system.

**** *Dune Developer Preview*

[[https://preview.dune.build/][Dune Developer Preview]] is an experimental channel that introduces cutting-edge features to streamline OCaml development workflows. Building upon Dune's foundation as OCaml's official build system, this initiative allows us to iterate quickly on ideas and experiment with improving the developer experience and with experimental features. For example, one feature that came out of Dune Developer Preview and made it into the upstream codebase is package management: by enabling Dune to deal with project dependencies, we eliminate the need to juggle multiple tools.

The tooling includes built-in LSP support, formatting capabilities, and a shared cache that dramatically improves build performance. Early adopters are encouraged to [[https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/d/e/1FAIpQLSda-mOTHIdATTt_e9dFmNgUCy-fD55Qzr3bGGsxpfY_Ecfyxw/viewform?usp=send_form][provide feedback]] as these experimental features mature toward stable releases.

We are in the process of adopting Dune Developer Preview for the OCaml Platform Tools and other projects. This is to ensure that (1) Dune Developer Preview keeps providing a good developer experience on production codebases and (2) to catch bugs and issues as early as we can. At the moment, we are making a concerted effort to fix issues and add necessary features that block adoption of Dune Developer Preview on the OCaml Platform Tools projects.

We're always interested in and addressing community feedback and bug reports, as well. In March, we conducted a [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-developer-preview-updates/15160/57][public survey to better understand the reach, adoption, and experience of/with Dune Developer Preview]] in the OCaml community.

To better understand how the OCaml community uses the different editor plugins available for OCaml, and to get an idea which features are most anticipated, we ran a [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-editors-plugins-survey/16216][survey on the OCaml Editors Plugins]].

*Merlin maintained by:* Ulysse Gérard (@voodoos, Tarides), Xavier Van de Woestyne (@xvw, Tarides)

**** Merlin and OCaml LSP Server

Project-wide occurrences are available in both Merlin and OCaml-LSP, allowing developers to find all instances of a symbol across their codebase by running ~dune build @build-index -w~. The feature has basic editor support via ~merlin-project-occurrences~ in Emacs and ~:MerlinOccurrencesProjectWide~ in Vim. Additionally, users of OCaml 5.3 and LSP-based plugins can experiment with the first iteration on project-wide *renaming*.

**** Visual Studio Code plugin

Behind the scenes, some work is happening on improving the developer experience for the OCaml VSCode editor plugin: When ~ocaml-lsp-server~ is not found in the opam switch, the plugin will prompt the user to offer installing it, and we are working on making the editor plugin work seamlessly with the recent dune package management features.

- WIP on Dune: Automatically configuring dune package management: https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform/pull/1791

**** Emacs support

On January 17, [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-eglot-1-0-0/15978/14][OCaml-eglot version 1.0.0 was released]], providing a new minor emacs mode to enable the editor features provided by *ocaml-lsp-server*. This replaces the venerable “merlin-mode”, after many years of loyal service.

Subsequent releases [[https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot/releases/tag/1.1.0][~1.1.0~]] and [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-eglot-1-2-0/16515][~1.2.0~]] enable support for ~flycheck~ as a configurable alternative to ~flymake~ (~1.0.0~ release), Emacs ~30.1~ support, better user experience and error handling, as well as support for new features.

All these features have enabled OCaml-eglot to support client commands, making it possible to extend OCaml-eglot more easily and to integrate features much more rapidly. Since version ~1.2.0~, OCaml-eglot has all the functions of Merlin mode (and more)!

We encourage you to try ~ocaml-eglot~ (refer to the updated [[https://ocaml.org/docs/set-up-editor#emacs][documentation on editor setup on OCaml.org]]) and to [[https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot/issues][give feedback / report bugs by raising an issue on the ocaml-eglot repository]]!

Besides this, we have updated the documentation on Editor Setup on OCaml.org to reflect the new situation for Emacs!

*** *Documentation Tools*

*Roadmap:* [[https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap#w25-generate-documentation][Share / (W25) Generate Documentation]]

**** Odoc

Odoc 3.0 has arrived after more than a year of development since the previous 2.4 release, bringing significant enhancements to OCaml's documentation tooling. The update introduces powerful new features including type-based search functionality through [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/tree/master/sherlodoc][Sherlodoc]], a global sidebar for improved navigation across documentation pages, and integrated source code display that allows developers to jump directly from documentation to rendered source regardless of module system complexity. Additional highlights include support for multimedia content (images, video, and audio), hierarchical documentation pages for better structure, and cross-package linking capabilities that create truly connected documentation, as well as support for incremental documentation builds.

It's worth noting that Dune does not yet support Odoc 3 as its rules need rewriting to accommodate the new CLI and incremental build capabilities. In the interim, developers can use the standalone ~odoc_driver~ command to generate documentation for their packages as shown in the [[https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc-driver/index.html#remapping-dependencies]["Remapping dependencies" documentation]].

The Odoc team encourages all OCaml developers to test their documentation with the new release before publishing packages, which can help avoid post-release fixes like [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1333][this example]]. For a practical introduction to the new features, developers can install the package via ~opam install odoc-driver~ and explore the comprehensive documentation available for the [[https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/][Odoc toolchain]].

*** *Package Management*

**** Opam

The [[https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-4-0-alpha1/][first alpha of opam 2.4.0 has been released]], bringing significant improvements.

The removal of GNU ~patch~ and ~diff~ as runtime dependencies reduces cross-platform inconsistencies, as the manager now uses the native OCaml ~patch~ library instead. Nix users will appreciate Nix support for external dependencies, facilitating more consistent environments across development and production systems.

Notable for daily development work: pinned VCS repositories now display their current revision for better traceability, and several UI improvements provide clearer visibility into deprecated packages. The enhanced command set includes version comparison tools and better lock file management with ~opam lock --keep-local~, particularly useful for maintaining consistent dependency states across team environments.

Teams running NixOS will benefit from fixed sandboxing support, while the new ~OPAMSOLVERTOLERANCE~ environment variable helps resolve persistent solver timeouts that previously was unsolvable by MCCS.

Early testing and feedback from development teams is encouraged to ensure a stable final release. Please [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues][report any issues to the bug-tracker]].

*Notable Activity*

**** Dune-release

*Roadmap:* [[https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap#w26-package-publication][Share / (W26) Package Publication]]

Dune-release 2.1.0, has been released, providing a new command ~dune-release delegate-info version~, which makes it easier to identify the current version of a package as inferred by the tool. Additionally, the release introduces more flexibility with the ~--dev-repo~ flag for ~dune-release~ and ~dune-release publish~ commands, allowing users to override the ~dev-repo~ field specified in the ~.opam~ file during the release process.

Dune-release no longer publishes documentation to GitHub Pages by default. This decision reflects the OCaml ecosystem's consolidation around centralized documentation, as package documentation is now automatically built and served by [[https://ocaml.org/packages][ocaml.org/packages]] following publication to the opam repository.

The update also improves compatibility and resolves several issues, including a fix for decoding GitHub URLs and ensuring dune-release works with the experimental package management feature from Dune. The tool now handles the presence of ~~/.dune/bin/dune~ without failing, making it more robust for developers exploring Dune's newer features.

*** Ppxlib

The ppxlib team has released versions 0.35.0 and 0.36.0!

Ppxlib 0.35.0, released in February 2025, brings significant improvements for OCaml 5.3 compatibility by allowing ppx rewriters to operate on files containing the new effect syntax. While ppx extensions and effect syntax can coexist, developers should note that rewriters might encounter errors when processing effect syntax nodes in extension payloads or generated code. The release introduces a new ~--use-compiler-pp~ driver flag, useful for preserving effect syntax when outputting source code instead of marshalled AST. This update also removes support for compilers older than 4.08.

The latest ppxlib 0.36.0, released in March 2025, updates the internal AST to target OCaml 5.2, enabling ppx authors to leverage features from this version while maintaining compatibility with OCaml 4.08.0 and newer. This release includes notable changes to the representation of functions. Thus, package authors are strongly encouraged to consult [[https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/wiki/Upgrading-to-ppxlib-0.36.0][the upgrade guide]] as many ppxes may break.

Other improvements include fixing a bug in ~loc_of_attribute~, adding support for the ~[@@@expand_inline]~ transformation and floating attribute context-free transformations, and introducing a ~-raise-embedded-errors~ flag to the driver.

*** OCaml Infrastructure

The OCaml infrastructure team has upgraded their OBuilder workers for FreeBSD from version 14.1 to 14.2, which directly impacts two key continuous integration services:

1. *OCaml-CI* ([[https://ocaml.ci.dev][ocaml.ci.dev]]) - This service automatically tests OCaml projects hosted on GitHub, and will now test against FreeBSD 14.2 instead of 14.1. Projects using this CI service will automatically be tested against the newer FreeBSD version.
2. *opam-repo-CI* ([[https://opam.ci.ocaml.org][opam.ci.ocaml.org]]) - This service tests pull requests to the opam package repository, and will also now test against FreeBSD 14.2 rather than 14.1.

With the release of ~ocaml-version~ 4.0.0, the OCaml version considered "recent" has been raised from 4.02 to 4.08. This change affects multiple services that use this definition to determine which OCaml versions to test against:

1. *OCaml-CI* - Will adjust which OCaml compiler versions are tested by default for projects
2. *opam-repo-CI* - Will modify its testing matrix for packages in the opam repository
3. *Docker base image builder* - Will only build images for OCaml 4.08 and newer

As these services update, testing on older OCaml releases (versions 4.02 through 4.07) will be gradually removed. Package maintainers should consider upgrading projects still using pre-4.08 OCaml versions to OCaml 4.08 or higher.

Apart from this, at the end of April 2025, registry.ci.dev, opam-repo-ci, OCaml-CI and get.dune.build were moved from Equinix Hosting to hosting at the Cambridge University Computer Lab, because of the [[https://deploy.equinix.com/blog/sunsetting-equinix-metal/][sunset of the Equinix Metal platform]].

**** WIP: Odoc 3 on OCaml-Docs-CI

The OCaml documentation pages provided through the [[https://ocaml.org/packages][OCaml.org package area]] are scheduled to receive significant updates with the release of odoc 3. To enable odoc 3 and all of its new features on OCaml.org, we are overhauling the docs-ci pipeline that powers documentation on ocaml.org. The improved pipeline addresses dependency complexities by using a new tool (https://github.com/jonludlam/opamh) that archives and restores opam packages, eliminating redundant builds of packages like dune that previously occurred thousands of times. The underlying infrastructure is also being upgraded, with plans to migrate docs-ci to a new blade server.
