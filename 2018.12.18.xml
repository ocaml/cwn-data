      <cwn_who>Laurent Mazare announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We are very pleased to announce the first release of our PyTorch bindings for ocaml. These bindings provide a NumPy like tensor library with GPU acceleration and support for automatic differentiation.

The ~torch~ package can be installed via opam. More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch), including a [tutorial](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch/tree/master/examples/mnist) training some neural networks on the MNIST dataset, various deep-learning examples: Generative Adverserial Networks, Neural Style Transfer, state of the art computer vision models on CIFAR-10, etc. Pre-trained weights for some recent computer vision models are also provided.

Any feedback is very welcome. Hopefully we will write a couple new tutorials to describe the current examples and add more examples in the next few weeks.

(note that the ~tensorflow~ package providing TensorFlow bindings also has been updated this week and is now up to speed with the github repo)

      <cwn_title>~travesty~, monadic traversals, state monads, and suchlike on top of Core's monads</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-travesty-monadic-traversals-state-monads-and-suchlike-on-top-of-cores-monads/3047/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Matt Windsor announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
My first OPAM package, ~travesty~, is now [in the repository](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/travesty/travesty.0.1.2/) :tada:

*** What is it?

Travesty is (yet another :upside_down_face:) implementation of monadic traversals (similar to Haskell's ~Traversable~ typeclass), state monads and transformers, and several other container and monad extensions.  Though it's nowhere near as comprehensive as, say, BAP's [monads library](http://binaryanalysisplatform.github.io/bap/api/v1.3.0/Monads.Std.html), it sits on top of ~Core_kernel~'s existing ~Monad~ and ~Container~ infrastructure and tries to use similar conventions where possible.

Travesty specifically includes:

- a ~Mappable~ signature set that captures ~map~ping over arity-0 and arity-1 types (what Haskell would call a functor);
- a ~Traversable~ signature set that describes ~map_m~, a generalisation of ~map~ to Core-style monads similar to Haskell's _traverse_;
- an implementation of state transformers over Core monads, and standalone state monads;
- some functors for deriving Core-style ~Container~s from types with monadic traversals (since ~map_m~ over a state monad can derive ~fold~);
- various helper functions for building ~map_m~ over Fieldslib and Variantslib derived operations;
- a ~Singleton~ container, which lifts a single value into a traversable container;
- miscellaneous extensions for Core containers, and specific extensions for ~list~ and ~option~.

Travesty is [MIT licenced](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/travesty/blob/master/LICENSE).

*Caveat emptor:* Travesty is still in pre-release (~v0.1.2~ at time of writing).  This is because I very much expect to make breaking changes to the API.  Now that it's on ~OPAM~, I'll try to keep any pre-~v1~ breaking changes to minor version increments, but nonetheless here be dragons.

*** Why does this exist?

Travesty is a spin-off from [some other work I've been doing](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/act), where the same monadic concepts kept recurring over and over again, and eventually accumulated in a ~utils~ module.  I figured that it might be useful for other ~Core~-style projects, so I spun it out.

(To be honest, I didn't notice BAP's monads library until _after_ I'd done so :scream: , though I feel like Travesty has a niche for being a more '~Core~-ish' library.)

*** Is there documentation?

Autogenerated API documentation is [here](https://mattwindsor91.github.io/travesty/) --- for now, I've tried to make it comprehensive in terms of describing signatures, but it's missing examples and usage information.  I'm also new to ~odoc~, so I'm learning how to document as I go along :slightly_smiling_face:

*** What about contributions?

I'm very much open to contributions, be they extensions, documentation improvements, cleanups, and so on---either through issues or direct pull requests.  I'm fairly new to all of this (having come from a more Haskell-y world, ~travesty~ is mostly the end result of trying to program OCaml like Haskell!), so I greatly appreciate any engagement available.

      <cwn_what>
FYI, The Monads library is also pretty Core stylish, as not only it implements the Core monad interface (that keeps changing from version to version of the Core library), but it also provides [the container interface][1]. Basically, the traversal.

      <cwn_title>Some feedback on teaching with jbuilder as a build tool</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/some-feedback-on-teaching-with-jbuilder-as-a-build-tool/3050/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>David Chemouil announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I've been TA-ing a course on functional programming in OCaml at [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/), Toulouse, since September and it's just over now. Students, 4th year students after the "baccalauréat" (how do you call them? graduates? postgraduates?), had to follow several lectures as well as roughly 10 seminars and 10 lab sessions. The whole course was completely revamped this year, so we also decided to use Jbuilder (not Dune, as we had to set up an infrastructure long before Dune 1.0) for our lab sessions.

Overall, the experience has been very nice, so kudos to Dune developers!

However, we also had a few issues that I would like to report for the record (Cc: @diml  @rgrinberg ), and perhaps to foster a few evolutions of Dune (or to be shown how to solve them easily : we may have missed some information in the documentation).

1) ~jbuilder runtest~ sometimes just hangs while running, I'll try to devise an MWE later but I'm still reporting this in case this is already a known issue.

2) Sometimes we wanted to have a program open a file whose path would be relative to the source code itself and harcoded in the ML file. For instance, the OCaml file contained something like ~open_in "./foo"~. Unfortunately, it seems Jbuilder doesn't run ~runtest~ and ~utop~ from the same working directory, hence depending on the path written in the ML file, one of these commands failed. Is there an easy way to solve this? (We know we could use an absolute path to some location, but we have dozens of PCs running on a university network, so the configuration is not as flexible as one could expect. We'd also like to avoid passing the path on the commandline.)

3) I already spoke about this in another post (https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/dune-link-against-cmo-cmi-without-source/2488/8) but I'm writing this here too: we sometimes like to provide students with a .cmi/.cmo file pair but no source code. AFAIK there's no simple, straightforward way to do this with Dune alone...

Well that's about it. We met a couple of other problems but they could be solved in a reasonably easy way. The only trouble now is that, sometimes, students would like to create their own ~jbuild~ file or update one we have provided, and it's a bit hard for them to know how to proceed (and the Dune documentation is good but perhaps more aimed at regular developers than students). I expect future versions of Dune or some Dune plugins, or even other tools, to ease setting up basic projects without writing the dune file yourself (e.g. something like ~dune new-lib mylib~ or ~dune add-dep mylib core_kernel~).

I agree that the Dune docs by themselves are not the best starting point.  Maybe some of the links here would be helpful:

      <cwn_title>Ppxlib 0.4.0</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppxlib-0-4-0/3063/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Jérémie Dimino announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The ppxlib team is pleased to announce the release of [ppxlib](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib) 0.4.0. This release adds better support for defining compile-time interpretation of dotted operators such as ~+.+~ and also improves integration with other tools such as reason or metaocaml by no longer complaining about attributes generated by these tools. In particular, ppxlib now treats all attributes whose name start with an ~_~ as machine generated attributes and doesn't complain if it can't decide whether they have been correctly interpreted or not. FTR, ppxlib tries to detect attributes and extension points that are dead-code, in order to catch typing mistakes or misplacement.

Here is the full changelog for this release:

- Do not report errors about dropped or uninterpreted attributes
  starting with ~_~ (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#46, fix ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#40, @diml)

- Fix he ~special_function~ rule for dotted operators and allow
  ~Longident.parse~ to parse dotted operators (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#44, @Octachron)

- Port to ~dune~ and remove use of bash (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#45, @rgrinberg)

- Ignore all attribites starting with ~_~ (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#46, @diml)

- Reserve the ~reason~ and ~refmt~ namespaces (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#46, @diml)

- Reserve the ~metaocaml~ namespace (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#50, @rgrinberg)

- Fix attribute extraction for Otag/Rtag (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#51, @xclerc)

- Do not relocate files unless ~-loc-filename~ is passed (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#55, @hhugo)

- Perserve the filename in the output (ocaml-ppx/ppxlib#56, @hhugo)
