      <cwn_what>
Hello everyone :wave:

Very good news: The OCaml community is signed up for the next Outreachy round with four slots again!

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a non-profit providing an over-arching structure for open-source
communities to offer three months long remote internships to folks from underrepresented backgrounds in
open-source. Participating in Outreachy is a great opportunity for any open-source community to work with new
people, to increase its outreach, and to open a first door to more diversity in the community.

The [OCaml community has a long history](https://ocaml.org/outreachy) of participating in that wonderful
initiative. There have been all kinds of OCaml projects that interns have worked on, shaped, and given input to
every year since 2014 (with the exception of 2017/18). And also this (Northern hemisphere) winter, [we're having
three amazing interns with us](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/welcoming-our-new-outrechy-interns/13652).

So, as a first point, I want to say: Thank you, everyone! :heart: I myself have started being involved in the OCaml
Outreachy organization only recently, while the whole community has been driving this for a long time now. And
that's one of the many things that's really really nice about OCaml: There are nice industrial users, in this case
[Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and [Tarides](https://tarides.com/), who're willing to fund these kinds
of efforts, and there's a whole lot of community members who're willing to (and enjoy!) getting involved, come up
with projects, and mentor.

And that brings me to my second point: Do reach out to us if you also want to form part of this. It's up to you
whether you want to write in this thread or to DM @patricoferris and/or me (@pitag). Just like in the last couple
of rounds, I already have a few concrete people in mind to reach out to for the upcoming round. However, I don't
know and can't know everyone in the community in person. So me reaching out to people is working well so far, but
people reaching out to us would be much easier and a lot less restrictive.

PD: I'll post here with the relevant dates for the next round once they become more relevant. To already give one
date: The deadline for OCaml community members to submit internship projects is **Feb. 23, 2024**.

      <cwn_what>
Welcome to the November and December 2023 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This update has been compiled by the
OCaml.org team. You can find [previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/ocamlorg-newsletter) on Discuss.

Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants to get started and be productive in OCaml. The
OCaml.org newsletter provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview of the changes we are
working on.

We couldn't do it without all the amazing OCaml community members who help us review, revise, and create better
OCaml documentation. Your feedback enables us to better prioritise our work and make progress towards our goal.
Thank you!

This newsletter covers:
- *Learn Area:* We made substantial changes to the Learn Area UI, introducing a new landing page and improving various elements on the Learn Area's subpages. Work on a documentation search feature is in progress, and new documentation has been added or substantially improved!
- *Upcoming Dark Mode*: We completed the UI designs for the upcoming dark mode and our Outreachy intern has
started to implement the changes.
- *Announcing the Outreachy Interns*: We're happy to welcome two interns to work on OCaml projects!
- *General Improvements:* As usual, we also worked on general maintenance and improvements based on user feedback, so we're highlighting some of our work below.

*** Open Issues for Contributors

We created many issues for external contributors. The majority of them are suitable for OCaml beginners, and we're
happy to review and provide feedback on your pull requests!

You can find [open issues for contributors
here](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee)!

*** Learn Area

**** 1. Redesign of the Learn Area

OCaml.org is undergoing an exciting transformation, and we're thrilled to share some key updates with you. Our main
focus has been the finalisation and approval of a new user interface (UI) design, aimed at enhancing your
experience. This update isn't just about looks; we're ensuring the website is fully optimised for mobile and tablet
devices.

The collaboration between our team and users like you has been instrumental in shaping the project. Your input and
support have been invaluable, and we're grateful for the community's involvement in making this website the best it
can be.

Our design system has seen several updates, including new components like a variable landing page button, diverse
icons (including social media and OCaml icons like Dune and opam), enhanced text styles, updated color variables,
and more.

We've completed the designs for all pages of the Learn area. Each page has been designed with attention to detail,
ensuring consistency and coherence across all versions.

If you’re curious and want to take a closer look at the designs, you can access our [Figma Design
Files](https://www.figma.com/file/6BSOEqSsyQeulwLo2pjs9r/Untitled?type=design&amp;node-id=0%3A1&amp;mode=design&amp;t=GwVxvrXItX7k8pP9-1).
Please be aware that the content shown on the pages is not always accurate. We aim to provide our designer with
better content for the mockups and UI going forward.

The work on implementing the new designs for the light mode of the Learn area have been completed in December!

**** 2. OCaml Documentation

In November, we focussed on addressing and incorporating community feedback on the "Getting Started" documents. The
comments and discussion on Discuss were so helpful. We encourage more of that!

We also worked on polishing "Basic Data Types" and "Values and Functions." Plus the team has been working on new
"Modules," "Functors," and "Libraries With Dune" documents, hoping to have it, and the ones in community review
(below), published before the end of the year.

truly great with your help!

*** Upcoming Dark Mode

In December, [oyenuga17](https://github.com/oyenuga17) started to implement the new dark mode on OCaml.org. Plans
are to complete and activate the dark mode based on browser / operating system preferences by early March.

We continuously merge small patches into ocaml.org, and you can take a look at completed dark mode pages on
https://staging.ocaml.org. We placed a button at the bottom of the page to toggle the dark mode on staging (this is
not going to be released, it is only a means for us to review the dark mode pages).

*Relevant Activities and PRs:*
- Implement dark mode on learn area landing page - [ocaml/ocaml.org#1836](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/1836)
- UI design for dark mode on all OCaml.org pages, and resulting Design System changes

*** Announcing the Outreachy Interns

In November, we reviewed and rated the Outreachy contributions for the dark mode project and the GUI project and
selected the two interns. [@oyenuga17](https://github.com/oyenuga17) is working with the OCaml.org team on
implementing the dark mode, while [@IdaraNabuk](https://github.com/IdaraNabuk) has been selected for the GUI
project. Congratulations [@IdaraNabuk](https://github.com/IdaraNabuk) and
[@oyenuga17](https://github.com/oyenuga17)!

Since the Outreachy application period ended in October, we list all the remaining pull requests done on Outreachy
Issues in the "General Improvements" section below.

*** General Improvements

*Most Important Changes TLDR*:
- There's now a self-hosted Plausible.io instance for OCaml.org, accessible at https://plausible.ci.dev/ocaml.org!
- You can see the different OCaml teams (Compiler, Platform, Packaging, Infrastructure, OCaml.org) and the maintainers of relevant repositories at the new governance page at https://ocaml.org/governance!
- The OCaml Logo now has a dedicated page at https://ocaml.org/logo!
- We’re now displaying a package's README on the package overview page.
- You can now [list upcoming events](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#content-upcoming_event) with date and time on https://ocaml.org/community.
- OCaml.org now has social media images, so that sharing OCaml.org links looks nicer.

Many thanks go out to the many contributors who helped improve OCaml.org in November and December. Find them listed
below!

The [default opam repository](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/) has been getting larger and larger with an
ever increasing number of packages. This is somewhat of a good sign for the active community of OCaml developers.
But it is also a challenge for its use, for its maintenance, and for the execution of its CI.

A discussion on the future of the opam repository is happening and we (the opam repository maintainers) would like
to invite OCaml developers at large to participate.

You can read the dedicated github issue [Requests for comments: how does opam-repository
scale?](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/23789) and share opinions there.

You can also join the public meeting held Wednesday 2024-01-24 at 14:00 GMT on
https://meet.jit.si/opam-repo-meeting.

Please do prefer the issue (rather than this thread) to discuss the issue (to keep the discussion in a central
location).

      <cwn_title>dune 3.13</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-13/13911/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Etienne Millon announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We're happy to announce that Dune 3.13.0 is now available.
This feature is packed with fixes and new features that you can find in the changelog.

There are a few new features that we would like to specially highlight.

*** Generate Conflicts File for Menhir Grammars ([#9512](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/9512), [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb))

When ~menhir~ is used to generate code from ~.mly~ files, there are sometimes issues with the grammar itself, such
as shift-reduce conflicts.

Menhir has an option to generate a "conflicts" file using its ~--explain~ flag, but until now this was not exposed
by Dune. Starting from this version, this file will be generated automatically to help developers debug their
grammars.

*** Cached Directory Targets ([#9535](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/9535), [@rleshchinskiy](https://github.com/rleshchinskiy))

Dune's global cache is a way to save the result of intermediate build results, even across projects. Previously, it
would only work with file targets. With this change, it now supports Dune's experimental directory targets.

*** Dynamic Module List ([#9578](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/9578), [@nojb](https://github.com/nojb))

In several places in the Dune language, it is possible to pass a list of modules. For example in a ~(library)~
stanza, if for some reason the default of picking all the source files in the current directory is not the right
thing to do, it is possible to pass ~(module A B C)~ to only attach these modules to the library.

An important limitation has been that the list of modules needed to be static: written as is in the ~dune~ file.
This limitation has now been lifted and it is possible to use ~(:include)~ or ~%{read-lines:file}~ in this field
and similar ones.

LexiFi's use case is a system of static plug-ins: a program is extended by selecting which modules are linked to
the application core. This list of modules can now be emitted by a generator that reads a configuration file.

Previously, this required using OCaml syntax for the ~dune~ file, which has several issues, including
incompatibility with features like ~(include_subdirs)~ and poor performance because Dune does not know the
dependencies of the generator and needs to re-run the build more times than necessary.

Here is the full changelog:

*** Added
- Add command ~dune cache clear~ to completely delete all traces of the Dune
  cache. (#8975, @nojb)
- Allow to disable Coq 0.8 deprecation warning (#9439, @ejgallego)
- Allow ~OCAMLFIND_TOOLCHAIN~ to be set per context in the workspace file
  through the ~env~ stanza. (#9449, @rgrinberg)
- Menhir: generate ~.conflicts~ file by default. Add new field to the
  ~(menhir)~ stanza to control the generation of this file: ~(explain &lt;blang
  expression&gt;)~. Introduce ~(menhir (flags ...) (explain ...))~ field in the
  ~(env)~ stanza, delete ~(menhir_flags)~ field. All changes are guarded under
  a new version of the Menhir extension, 3.0. (#9512, @nojb)
- Directory targets can now be cached. (#9535, @rleshchinskiy)
- It is now possible to use special forms such as ~(:include)~ and variables
  ~%{read-lines:}~ in ~(modules)~ and similar fields. Note that the
  dependencies introduced in this way (ie the files being read) must live in a
  different directory than the stanza making use of them. (#9578, @nojb)
- Remove warning 30 from default set for projects where dune lang is at least
  3.13 (#9568, @gasche)
- Add ~coqdoc_flags~ field to ~coq~ field of ~env~ stanza allowing the setting
  of workspace-wide defaults for ~coqdoc_flags~. (#9280, fixes #9139, @Alizter)
- ctypes: fix an error where ~(ctypes)~ with no ~(function_description)~ would
  cause an error trying refer to a nonexistent ~_stubs.a~ dependency (#9302,
  fix #9300, @emillon)

*** Changed
- Check that package names in ~(depends)~ and related fields in ~dune-project~
  are well-formed. (#9472, fixes #9270, @ElectreAAS)

*** Fixed
- Do not ignore ~(formatting ..)~ settings in context or workspace files
  (#8447, @rgrinberg)
- Fixed a bug where Dune was incorrectly parsing the output of coqdep when it
  was escaped, as is the case on Windows. (#9231, fixes #9218, @Alizter)
- Copying mode for sandboxes will now follow symbolic links (#9282, @rgrinberg)
- Forbid the empty ~(binaries ..)~ field in the ~env~ stanza in the workspace
  file unless language version is at least 3.2. (#9309, @rgrinberg)
- [coq] Fix bug in computation of flags when composed with boot theories.
  (#9347, fixes #7909, @ejgallego)
- Fixed a bug where the ~(select)~ field of the ~(libraries)~ field of the
  ~(test)~ stanza wasn't working properly. (#9387, fixes #9365, @Alizter)
- Fix handling of the ~PATH~ argument to ~dune init proj NAME PATH~. An
  intermediate directory called ~NAME~ is no longer created if ~PATH~ is
  supplied, so ~dune init proj my_project .~ will now initialize a project in
  the current working directory. (#9447, fixes #9209, @shonfeder)
- Experimental doc rules: Correctly handle the case when a package depends upon
  its own sublibraries (#9461, fixes #9456, @jonludlam)
- Resolve various public binaries to their build location, rather than to where
  they're copied in the ~_build/install~ directory (#9496, fixes #7908,
  @rgrinberg).
- Correctly ignore warning flags in vendored projects (#9515, @rgrinberg)
- Use watch exclusions in watch mode on MacOS (#9643, fixes #9517,
  @PoorlyDefinedBehaviour)
- Fix merlin configuration for ~(include_subdirs qualified)~ modules (#9659,
  fixes #8297, @rgrinberg)
- Fix handling of ~enabled_if~ in binary install stanzas. Previously, we'd
  ignore the result of ~enabled_if~ when evaluating ~%{bin:..}~ (#9707,
  @rgrinberg)

      <cwn_who>Kate announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
On behalf of the opam dev team, I’m happy to announce the first beta release of opam 2.2.0.

*** What’s new in this beta?

- ~opam init~ on Windows now requires you to choose which Git to use. Git for Windows is now recommended by default, though Cygwin's Git can of course still be used. See the blog post linked below for more info on why choose one over the other.
- when compiling opam on Windows with MinGW, the resulting opam binary now contains ~libstdc++~ instead of requiring the DLL to be distributed alongside it or to be present in the environment during compilation
- fix ~opam env~ containing carriage return on Cygwin - ~eval $(opam env)~ now works from a Cygwin bash terminal
- as well as a bunch of bug fixes and improvements

You’ll find these features presented in the [blog post](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-2-0-beta1/), and for
some extra details you can take a look at the [release
note](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.2.0-beta1) or the
[changelog](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/2.2.0-beta1/CHANGES).

We encourage you to try out this beta release, instructions are detailed in the [blog
post](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-2-0-beta1), in particular [if you're using
Windows](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-2-0-beta1/#How-to-Test-opam-on-Windows) for which we provide a – /still
experimental/ – pre-built binary.

On Unix-like systems though, to upgrade, simply run:
#+begin_example
bash -c "sh &lt;(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version
2.2.0~beta1"
#+end_example

Happy hacking,
*&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; The opam team &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;* :camel:

      <cwn_title>Zipc 0.1.0</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-zipc-0-1-0/13388/2</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Daniel Bünzli announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Zipc 0.2.0 has been [released](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25105) to the opam-repository.

It provides a few encoding bug fixes courtesy of Valentin Gatien-Baron's investigations on round tripping ~docx~
files with ~zipc~.

He also suggested not to ignore ~zip~'s declared metadata about decompression size to allow clients to easily cap
memory consumption for decoding untrusted zip files (breaking change).

The details are in the [release
notes](https://github.com/dbuenzli/zipc/blob/fa4bbfe4e70119665f39769bec9cfac9e0729304/CHANGES.md#v020-2024-01-22-la-forclaz-vs)
and many thanks to him.
