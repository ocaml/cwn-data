Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, for the week of April 18 to 25, 2006.

I finally found a connection this week, but next week might be more problematic.

1) Performance of threaded interpreter on hyper-threaded CPU
2) Any roadmap for OCaml compiler?
3) OCaml on Sparc

In order to get an idea of the speedup provided by a threaded code
interpreter, I've been comparing the performance of the switch-based
OCaml interpreter with the one which uses threaded code.

On some architectures, threaded code provides a speedup which matches
my expectations (around 20%), but on a hyper-threaded Pentium IV, I
actually get a massive slowdown: the threaded code interpreter is more
than two times slower than the switch-based one! I just wanted to
present my results here, since it seems that threaded code might not
always be the fastest option. I'd also be interested in knowing why
threaded code is so much slower in some cases, provided of course that
my results are not flawed.

My testing methodology and result are described below.

To get the two versions of the OCaml interpreter, I uncompress
ocaml-3.09.1 in two separate directories, and in one of them I simply
delete the line which defines THREADED_CODE in byterun/config.h. I
also add the following lines at the very beginning of ocaml_interprete
in byterun/interp.c (in both directories):

#ifdef THREADED_CODE
  fprintf(stderr, "threaded code\n");
#else
  fprintf(stderr, "switch-based\n");
#endif

They enable me to be sure that the version which is running is the one
I expect.

Once this is done, I compile the two versions by first launching
configure with a different prefix for both directories, and then
letting "make world install" do its job. When this is complete, I have
two versions of the interpreter, one using threaded code, the other
using a big switch, and my measurements can start.

To perform my measures, I use a small program which computes the
factorial of 5000 using a naive implementation of big integers
(represented as lists of "digits" in base 10000). I compile this
program once then run it with the switch-based interpreter, and then
with the threaded code one. I run the benchmark five times in a row,
and select the lowest time, as given by the "time" command. The
results are summarised in the following table. When the ratio given in
the last column is greater than 1, then threaded code is faster than
the switch-based solution. As you can see, this is only true in my
case for non-hyper-threaded architectures. Concerning the OS, the
first machine runs OS X 10.4.6, while the other ones run various
versions of Linux.

| architecture                      | switch | threaded |   ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------|
| 1.25 GHzPower PC G4               |   9.04 |     7.24 |  1.2486 |
| 1.70 GHz Pentium 4                |   6.36 |     4.81 |  1.3222 |
| 3.0 GHz Pentium 4, hyper-threaded |   2.51 |     6.13 | 0.40946 |
| dual 3.0 GHz Xeon, hyper-threaded |   3.32 |     3.59 | 0.92479 |

I also measured the time taken by "make world" on the third machine,
and the results confirm that the threaded code interpreter is slower
than the switch-based one. Here are the timings:

  switch-based : 89.53s user, 12.73s system
  threaded code: 114.77s user, 13.03 system
  ratio (sw/th): 0.78

I will gladly provide more information about the various systems used
for testing if anyone is interested.

The small benchmark program I'm using is available there:

Which version(s) of gcc do you use for compiling the bytecode
interpreter?  Is it the same version on all machines?

The reason I'm asking is that some versions of gcc are known to
generate poor code for threaded interpreters, e.g. gcc 3.2 generates
inferior code compared to gcc 2.95.  For more info, google for
"Anton Ertl gcc".

No, unfortunately not. Here are the various versions used (I realise
this variety is annoying, but I have no control over what software
runs on these machines):

1.25 GHz PPC G4
  powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1
   (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5247)
1.70 GHz P4
  gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)
3.0 GHz hyper-threaded P4
  gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat 3.4.4-2)
dual 3.0 GHz hyper-threaded Xeon
  gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat 3.4.4-2)

I'm aware of the problem due to gcc's cross-jumping "optimisation"
(described as you mention by Ertl in [1]). For the record, I tried
disabling it with -fno-crossjumping, but as Ertl mention, this didn't
change anything. However, judging by the versions of gcc I'm using,
cross-jumping should also be performed on the second machine, for
which threaded code provides a noticable gain...

However, your remark motivated me to measure the performance of a
single ocamlrun executable running on the various Pentium 4 I have at
hand, and the results are interesting...

Using the executable produced by gcc 3.2.2, I obtain the following
timings:

| architecture                      | switch | threaded |   ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------|
| 1.70 GHz Pentium 4                |   6.34 |     4.82 |  1.3154 |
| 3.0 GHz Pentium 4, hyper-threaded |   2.62 |     3.46 | 0.75723 |
| dual 3.0 GHz Xeon, hyper-threaded |   3.36 |     2.59 |  1.2973 |

while using the executable produced by gcc 3.4.4, I obtain the
following timings:

| architecture                      | switch | threaded |   ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------|
| 1.70 GHz Pentium 4                |   6.26 |     6.70 | 0.93433 |
| 3.0 GHz Pentium 4, hyper-threaded |   2.51 |     6.15 | 0.40813 |
| dual 3.0 GHz Xeon, hyper-threaded |   3.32 |     3.58 | 0.92737 |

Finally, I noticed that gcc 4.0.0 was also available on the second
machine, so I gave it a try, and obtained the following timings:

| architecture                      | switch | threaded |   ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------|
| 1.70 GHz Pentium 4                |   7.27 |     6.62 |  1.0982 |
| 3.0 GHz Pentium 4, hyper-threaded |   2.37 |     4.75 | 0.49895 |
| dual 3.0 GHz Xeon, hyper-threaded |   3.91 |     3.56 |  1.0983 |

So the threaded code version of the OCaml VM is always slower on the
hyper-threaded P4, albeit not always by the same amount.

To clarify things: I'm not talking about a multi-threaded program.

"Threaded code" is a technique which is commonly used to speed up
dispatching in interpreters. It is relatively well described on the
following page:

<http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/threaded-code.html>

The OCaml VM is written in such a way that it uses that technique if
possible (basically if it is compiled using a recent gcc, which offers
the extensions needed to implement threaded code), and falls back to a
"standard" switch-based dispatching technique otherwise.

My observation is that in some circumstances, threaded code seems to
slow down the VM instead of speeding it up as it should. (The biggest
slowdown being observed on a hyper-threaded architecture, but I have
no idea why).

Random thoughts:

The performance variations between the gcc versions confirm my
impression that gcc is getting "too clever for its own good" --
carefully hand-optimized code like the OCaml bytecode interpreter
is best served by a compiler that compiles code nearly as written.
(Think gcc 2.95.)

The P4 microarchitecture is known for its weird performance model:
some code runs very fast, some similar code very slow.
In my experience, AMD processors as well as the Pentium-M are
much more consistent performance-wise.

If you really want to understand what's going on, you need a good
performance analysis tool.  Timing runs will tell you nothing.
Intel's VTUNE is king of the hill here, but the Windows version is
costly and I could never install the free Linux version.

2) Any roadmap for OCaml compiler?

I went through the java.sun.com website and the latest roadmap I could
find was dated 2003.  Is it still an ongoing project?
</joke>
(Apologies, couldn't resist when I saw your e-mail address :)

More seriously: yes, OCaml is actively developed and meticulously
maintained.  There is one ".0" release with new features approximately
every year, and bug-fix releases every 3 months or so.  There's also a
solid user community that contributes quite a lot of OCaml software,
libraries and tools, see the "Caml Hump" on the Web site.

> If someone still working on it and fixing bugs for it?

Yes, the core Caml development team, approximately 5 persons at INRIA
and U.Nagoya.  We're all tenured academics, so we have no problems
with long-term projects.

> What's the plan for it for its future?

First, maintain and evolve it to support the needs of the many serious
users we have.  The rest depends mostly on the results of our research
on programming languages, as as usual with research, I won't tell you
what we're going to find before we've found it.

My research group and other groups in the vicinity stopped buying Sun
workstations circa 1994, as much better alternatives have been
available since then.  SPARCstations remained popular for a while with
our network administrators, as small servers, but I don't think I
could dumpster-dive and get any SPARCstation built in the 21st century.

Besides, resurrecting old hardware is time-consuming and generally
disappointing.  ("Oh my God, look at the dust cloud it coughed!  Hmmm,
that runs really slow...  The OS is five major versions behind!  Where
is my favorite open source software?  Ah, there's no CDROM in this
beast.  Where did I put my vintage external SCSI 1x CDROM?  (One
hour later.)  Damn, the internal disk is too small."  etc.)

Good idea.  It would look good in the machine room :)
