1) Mlglade prerelease announce
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin Monate announced:

Dear ocamlers,

I am happy to announce the first prerelease of mlglade : a glade to ocaml
compiler.

Glade is a freely available graphical interface builder for Gtk.
It is very powerful and enables one to quickly visually design very
complex graphical interfaces.
It can export source code for various languages like C, C++, Perl, Eiffel.
Mlglade adds support for the OCaml language.
It helps you to easily build ocaml applications with a gtk interface.
It is fully compatible with all OCaml versions from 3.01 to 3.03-alpha.

You can find the source and an online tutorial at
<a href="http://www.lri.fr/~monate/mlglade">http://www.lri.fr/~monate/mlglade</a>

This version is not complete yet but supports a large subset of gtk.


Do not hesitate to contact me for any comments, suggestions and/or bug
reports.

2) To glade or not to glade
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Florian Hars asked:

OK, now we have mlglade
&gt; <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~monate/mlglade">http://www.lri.fr/~monate/mlglade</a>
which uses Glade output, but is independent from libglade

the libglade support in LablGTK
<a href="http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html">http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html</a>
which, obviously, is different from mlglade in that it requires
libglade

and zoggy
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~guesdon/Tools/zoggy/zoggy.html">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~guesdon/Tools/zoggy/zoggy.html</a>
which is an independent reimplementation of the glade functionality.

Which should I use?

3) Looking for internships including O'Caml programming
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Philippe NARBEL asked:

J'enseigne ML (O'Caml) dans le cadre du Dess Genie Logiciel de
l'Universite Bordeaux I et comme chaque annee, certains etudiants
seraient interesses par des stages en entreprise comprenant une part
de programmation O'Caml.  Auriez-vous des propositions dans ce sens ?
Ce stage est prevu d'avril a juillet/septembre 2002.

I teach ML (O'Caml) as part of the Master of Science program in
Software Engineering at the University of Bordeaux.  Some of my
students are interested in considering an internship in a company
which would include ML programming. This internship takes place in a
national or international professional setting under the guidance of
an engineer and a teacher (expected amongst other things to conduct a
visit to the company). The internship begins at the start of April
2002 and lasts from 4 to 6 months. An internship agreement is
drawn up by the company and the university.

4) License Conditions for OCaml
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A few weeks ago, Patrick M Doane asked:

Earlier this year there was a discussion about the problems of using LGPL
for the OCaml run-time system and associated libraries.

It was suggested that some of the constraints in the LGPL were not
intended. To quote a page from the Caml website:

  "The LGPL puts no restrictions at all on programs linked with LGPL-ed
libraries. Thus, users are free to distribute (or not) OCaml-generated
binaries under whatever conditions they like."

&gt;From my reading of the LGPL, which seems to correspond with the opinions
of others on the list, this just isn't true.  If I develop an application
with OCaml, I must distribute that application with source code.  This
isn't acceptable for commercial development and I'd really hope that the
intention is for OCaml to be used outside of academia.

Will this problem be fixed for the 3.03 release?

(there has been many followups to this thread recently, the start of the
thread is at <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200111/msg00121.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200111/msg00121.html</a>)
