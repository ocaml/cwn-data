&gt; It just occurred to me that the ability to run an interactive top-level to 
&gt; write and test OpenGL programs would be quite alluring. In particular, this 
&gt; would be a great way to introduce students to ocaml and graphics.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I'd like to use lablglut, which requires execution to be handed over 
&gt; to glut via a final call to glut.mainLoop. So, what would be the best way to 
&gt; get glut and the ocaml top-level to interoperate?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess you could write a glut idle function which provokes the top-level into 
&gt; asking for more input, but the display wouldn't be updated in the mean time.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

Threads are the natural way to do this.
This is already possible with GlGtk, using lablgtk -thread.
If you want to do this with glut, I see two possible approaches:
* Run the glut main loop in a different thread, and have it exit every
  100ms so you can yield and run the toplevel thread during this time
  (this is basically the way this is done in lablgtk)
  This is safe, but supposes there is an easy way to exit and reenter
  the main loop frequently.
* Release the ocaml mutex with caml_enter_blocking_section when
  entering the main loop. This of course means you must call
  caml_leave_blocking_section before calling any callback. Fortunately
  there are not too many ways to enter callbacks in glut. However,
  there is a further difficulty: you must avoid race conditions when
  making calls to openGL from the toplevel. The simplest way to do
  that is not doing calls directly, but putting them in a queue, and
  executing them in an idle callback from glut. Such an infrastructure
  is defined in gtkThread.ml (for windows users)
The first way is simpler on Unix (no races for free), but the Windows
GDI is such that you cannot call graphical functions from another
thread anyway, so you end up needing the queue. The second approach
feels cleaner, but is harder to program in.
    </pre><i>Daniel Bünzli added:</i><br /><pre>
Just in case you are not aware your problem is easy to solve if you use 
sdl [1] instead of glut to setup your gl context and handle input. Sdl 
doesn't own your main loop, you can poll or wait for events and then 
continue with your own code.

This simplifies a lot the interaction with the toplevel. For example, 
you can enter a function from the toplevel which will handle user input 
until the user presses escape to return to the toplevel and reenter the 
function later again. Or you can just initialize the context and then 
paint your window from the toplevel without handling the input in the 
window.

The features you loose with respect to glut is menus and multiple 
windows. But with sdl you don't need threads to solve your problem, you 
control the loop and this may be simpler for students (unless you want 
to introduce them to concurrency at the same time...).


A more brittle path to follow (with glut or whatever) which I did not 
investigate deeply is to use the (hidden) Toploop module and to try to 
render and control the toplevel in one of your glut window. However I 
don't know enough about Toploop to be sure you can get to the expected 
result.

&gt; What I think would be useful is an OCaml wrapper around Gtk, Win32 and
&gt; Aqua/COCOA.  The idea would be for the OCaml wrapper to abstract away
&gt; the differences, allowing cross-platform programming with native
&gt; widgets.  WxWidgets fits the bill here, but the actual API is clunky.
&gt; I have a feeling that something could be done better with a functional
&gt; programming approach.

This has been proposed, discussed and forgotten more than one time on the
haskell-gui mailing list (of course, s/ocaml/haskell/). The most promising
projects for haskell in this area are htoolkit and wxhaskell:

<a href="http://htoolkit.sourceforge.net/">http://htoolkit.sourceforge.net/</a>
<a href="http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/">http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/</a>

I think that to do a serious effort in this direction involves both
designing the abstracted interface, which is nontrivial and perhaps can't
be done much better than wxwidgets, and implementing it - in a way, IMHO,
that can be used by more than one language. 

Wx fails in that direction, since it's written in C++ - there are wxcaml and
wxhaskell of course, but they seem to require lots of manual tuning to
complete the bindings (don't take this too seriously, I might be plain
wrong). Since XML user interfaces are in vogue these days, maybe the best
thing to do is to implement one of these, fulfilling the required
properties, and then binding for any language will be easy. Of course, it
won't be too efficient but when I see web pages that render faster and look
smarter than my "efficient" desktop I think that this is a non-issue.
    </pre><i>Gregory Guyomarc'h also answered Richard Jones:</i><br /><pre>
I think it has not yet been mentioned in this thread, but as far as I
understand it, the java Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) do just that. It
acts as a thin layer above the native toolkits (in fact it seems above
the simpler widgets like buttons, labels, etc, others like menu bars are
re-implemented in java). It already supports an impressive set of
backends: gtk, windows, carbon, photon, and motif. I don't know how well
the API compares to wxWidgets', I have never used any of them, but it
seems quite popular.

&gt; I'd suggest sticking to lablglut and writing your own GUI entirely using
&gt; OpenGL though, as I have found this to be much more stable. I don't really
&gt; think users will be too bothered by a slightly-different-looking GUI though
&gt; especially if it looks better. :-)

I've been down this road myself. I posted an OCaml version of Conway's
Game of Life on my webpage [1] a while back that uses "Kog", an OCaml
OpenGL based GUI I've been working on. The Life application only uses
the label, checkbox and button controls, but Kog also supports
spinners and drop-down listboxes.

My experiences building Kog were overall positive. However, writing a
full-featured GUI from scratch is a lot of work, so Kog is likely to
remain a toy implementation for the foreseeable future. If there's
much interest in the OCaml community for this sort of thing though,
I'd love to work with a group on a project getting a full-featured
lightweight GUI up and running with OCaml, whether it be on OpenGL
directly, or one of the higher level vector libraries.

Speaking of GUI libraries, I'm looking into writing a higher-level
wrapper around the GUI parts of Harry Chomsky's OCaml-Win32
library[2]. If anyone has already done this (and made it available
under a LGPL or BSD like license) and I've somehow missed it, please
let me know and I'll contribute to your project rather than
reinventing the wheel.

I have implemented a simple but efficient compiler from a tiny ML
subset to the SPARC assembly language.

  <a href="http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/min-caml.tar.gz">http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/min-caml.tar.gz</a>

The primary purpose is advanced education: the compiler is well
documented (only in Japanese for now, unfortunately)

  <a href="http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/">http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/</a>

and has been used in a class at Tokyo for years.

The compiler consists of only 2000 lines of OCaml.  Yet, it produces
as efficient SPARC code as OCaml and GCC does (for the tiny ML subset
and equivalent C programs).

  A typical functional program (Ackermann):

    GCC 6.8s
    OCaml 0.9s
    MinCaml 0.9s

  A typical imperative program (raytracing):

    GCC 14.7s
    OCaml 36.7s (could perhaps be improved by using BigArray)
    MinCaml 17.0s

So, please take a look if you are interested.  Even if you don't
understand Japanese, you may be able to understand OCaml!:-)
    </pre><i>Jon Harrop asked and Eijiro Sumii answered:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Did you choose SPARC because of availability or for technical reasons?

Both - Sun is still strong in universities around me and IA-32 is a
mess (for me, at least) compared to RISC...

&gt; What features of ML are implemented?

Only a _very_ tiny subset: for now, it does not have polymorphism,
data types, modules, nor garbage collection (so I shouldn't even call
it ML, except that the syntax is a subset of OCaml).  However, it
_does_ have type inference, higher-order functions, floating-point
numbers, tuples, and arrays with destructive update - which are
sufficient for minimal examples (such as gcd, ack, matrix, etc.)  and
one application (raytracing).  Also, it does implement optimizations
such as known-function calls, tail calls, inlining, constant folding,
etc.  It can call external functions if you provide the stubs in
assembly.

The subset is so tiny because MinCaml was developed for an
undergraduate course, where I put most energy to the ease of
understanding and couldn't include many features.  However, adding
them would be a nice project for more advanced students.

By the way, for the majority of people who do not speak Japanese:-), I
am preparing an Enlish documentation.

compiler development (unlike Xavier and other real experts here).

&gt; I have been using the camljava library for a certain time, in order to
&gt; establish communications between java and caml.
&gt; The initial use of the library (maintained by Mr Leroy) supposed explicitly
&gt; that it is ocaml that initiates the call to java (it is ocaml that creates a
&gt; jvm instance).
&gt; 
&gt; I was confronted to the situation where java is the instancianting process
&gt; that should initialize the ocaml runtime. This was done by a little effort,
&gt; by making the following :
&gt; *     Java makes call through native methods
&gt; *     At each call, the JNIEnv variable used in the c code in jnistubs.c
&gt; is set to the actual JNIEnv passed in the native call.
&gt; *     The instanciation and deltetion of the jvm (used when ocaml was the
&gt; instanciating process) is not realised, since a valid JNIEnv is passed at
&gt; each native call.

This looks fine, I would have done it in the same manner.

&gt; This solution seems satisfactory, but should be used (due to use of global
&gt; variable JNIEnv) in a context where each call to a native method is atomic.
&gt; This reflects in the java world that the call to native methods should be
&gt; made synchronised.
&gt; 
&gt; I am now facing a context where i need to make the library coherent with a
&gt; java multi threaded context.
&gt; The JNI manual states that each java thread will have it's own JNIEnv inside
&gt; the jvm. Therefore, two threads calling the same native method will pass two
&gt; different JNIEnv values. 

Yes, but with correct locking, these two calls will execute in
sequence, not in parallel, so it is still OK to store the JNIEnv in
the global variable from jnistubs.c.

The locking can be achieved either at the Java level (by using
synchronized methods on a unique, global object, or equivalently by
using the "synchronized" statement over such an object), or at the C
level using Pthread mutexes or Win32 critical sections.  I'd recommend
doing the locking at the Java level to ensure maximal compatibility
with the Java threading model.

&gt; The camljava API used to achieve communications between java and caml should
&gt; be made reentrant. In order to achieve this, i made a deeper change in the
&gt; camljava library by making all function calls reentrant, handling the JNIEnv
&gt; as a method parameter.

This is not necessary with proper locking as described above.

&gt; The idea that i would like to investigate more thoroughly is the possibility
&gt; to transpose the java threads into caml threads. If this is feasible, will
&gt; the execution be thread safe inside the GC ??

Probably not.  Moreover, as you mention, Java, Caml and the C layer
between the two can have different notions of threads, so a direct
mapping is generally not possible.

&gt; My questions are the following :
&gt; *     Will i be able to prolonge a java thread into a caml thread

No.

&gt; *     Will this make the execution GC safe

I don't think so.

&gt; *     If java threads are not native threads, can there still be a work
&gt; around ?

Locking at the Java level will ensure sequential (not concurrent)
execution of the Caml code and Caml runtime system functions, which is
what you need to enforce.
    </pre><i>El Chaar Rabih asked and Markus Mottl answered:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; I sent today a mail concenrning external threads (java threads) and caml.
&gt; When looking inside the caml-list, i came up upon your mail, which attracted
&gt; my attention.
&gt; 
&gt; My goal is to try and switch the jvm thread into a caml thread.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to have your opinion upon my post "Using camljava library in
&gt; a multithreaded context"?
&gt; Is it also possible to have a small example (C and ocaml) realising this
&gt; coordination issue ?

Unfortunately, I have no experience with Java so I cannot tell you
whether there is a way to let Java-threads migrate to OCaml.

My C-solution, which seems to work very well in practice, looks roughly
as follows:

  pthread_mutex_t cb_act_mtx;
  pthread_cond_t cb_act_cnd;
  value *cb_act;

  pthread_mutex_t cb_res_mtx;
  pthread_cond_t cb_res_cnd;

The first mutex and condition variable protect "cb_act", the callback
action to be performed.

If there is a C-thread that wants to call OCaml, it calls the following
function/method (it's actually C++):

  void do_cb(value *action)
  {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;cb_act_mtx);
      cb_act = action;
      pthread_cond_signal(&amp;cb_act_cnd);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;cb_act_mtx);

    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;cb_res_mtx);
      while (not cb_res_avail) pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cb_res_cnd, &amp;cb_res_mtx);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;cb_res_mtx);

    cb_res_avail = false;
  }

Depending on the kind of action that should be performed, an OCaml-thread
that has previously gone into C-land will eventually convert C-data to
OCaml-values before performing the callback.  After returning it will
signal the C-thread that a result is available (or simply that it has
completed the job).  The OCaml-thread has to perform all the conversions,
because the C-thread must not call the GC.  Our C-function, in which
the OCaml-thread waits for callbacks + associated data looks as follows:

  virtual value handle_cbs()
  {

    return Val_unit;  // we should never get here
  }

In OCaml you just need to specify the external function that the
OCaml-thread should call:

  external handle_cbs : t -&gt; unit = "activ_handle_cbs_stub"

Then do something like the following at startup:

  let wrap_handle_cbs () =
    try handle_cbs cgc
    with exc -&gt;
      (match exc with
      | Status sc -&gt;
          eprintf "Activ-exception: Status %s\n" (Status_code.to_string sc)
      | FieldStatus fs -&gt;
          eprintf
            "Activ-exception: FieldStatus %s\n" (Field_status.to_string fs)
      | _ -&gt;
          eprintf "Exception escaping callback: %s\n" (Printexc.to_string exc)
      );
      exit 2 in
  ignore (Thread.create wrap_handle_cbs ());

I hope that this info is enough so that you can make OCaml- and C-threads
interact smoothly.
