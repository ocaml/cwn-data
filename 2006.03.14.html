It is my pleasure to announce the release of HashSet,
a hashed set library for Objective Caml.

Buckets are ordered and the first element of a bucket is kept in a
separate array, with occupation controlled by a bitvector.

Version 0.1 is available at
<a href="http://wwwteor.mi.infn.it/~pernici/ocaml/ocaml.html">http://wwwteor.mi.infn.it/~pernici/ocaml/ocaml.html</a>
It is released under LGPL.

In tests on my desktop I find that, compared to Hashset in
<a href="http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html">http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html</a>
HashSet is usually 2x faster or more
for large sets (n &gt;= 100000) of integers and floats,
and roughly equivalent in other cases.

In the examples directory there is the nth.ml example with HashSet,
which for the case of 100-nth neighbours for amorphous silicon
is on my desktop more than 2x faster than the one in
<a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/complete/">http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/complete/</a>
which uses Set.
There are a few other examples which I found in the ocaml mailing lists.

&gt; There's a longer answer, but one short answer is: check out AtomCaml  at
&gt; <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/miker/atomcaml/">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/miker/atomcaml/</a>

Thank you for the interesting paper, I did not know about that work. Was
there an announcement on caml-list?

By the way, as a reply to initial Asfand Yar Quazi's question, there is
a simple way to implement deadlock free locking scheme, both for byte
and native code: call a locking routine that always try to lock the
needed locks *in the same order*. By using the high-order properties of
OCaml, this is very easy for the programmer to use it.

Such a locking scheme can be used in the following way (imagine you have
four bases, named like "participant" or "position", each one protected
with a multiple-reader/single-writer lock):

let do_atomic_work () =
  let unlock =
     lock_bases { no_locks with participant = Read_lock; 
                                position = Read_lock; } in
  let result = do_processing () in
  unlock ();
  result

Compared to AtomCaml approach, it is like if the do_processing code is
executed in a Commit phase.

Please find below the code that imlements this scheme (using Reader and
Writer mutex[1]). It could probably be optimized for speed (using
precomputed locking and unlocking functions stored in a hash table) or
improved to support more locks (using an ordered set as input to lock
function), but the general scheme is there.

\chapter{Control of data bases access}

Module [[Basesctrl]] controls the locks to access the data bases. 

Each of the four data bases (Participants, Classification, Delegation,
Position) can be accessed for reading or for writing. A reader/writer
lock (see chapter \ref{module:rwmutex}) protects each one of them.

All locking and unlocking of those bases are done through this
module. We can thus control the locking and unlocking order and thus
guarantee the absence of deadlocks.

The locking of the bases is done through the [[lock]] function. It locks
bases as desired and then return an unlocking function that should be
called to cancel locking.

\section{Data structures}

Each lock can either be taken for reading ([[Read_lock]]), for writing
([[Write_lock]]) or not taken at all ([[No_lock]]).

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
type lock_type =
  | Read_lock
  | Write_lock
  | No_lock
 &lt;at&gt;  

We define a data structure [[t]] that indicates, for each action on the
database, the desired (un)locking for each base.

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
type t = {
    participant : lock_type;
    classification : lock_type;
    delegation : lock_type;
    position : lock_type;
  }
 &lt;at&gt;  

We define a default lock state [[no_locks]] where no locks are taken.

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let no_locks = {
  participant = No_lock;
  classification = No_lock;
  delegation = No_lock;
  position = No_lock;
}
 &lt;at&gt;  

We also define the actual set of locks that protect bases. We chose a
[[Writer_preference]] to give priority to data base modifications that
should be less frequent that data base reading.

\nextchunklabel{code:basesctrl:locks}
&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let pref = Rwmutex.Writer_preference

let participant_lock = Rwmutex.create pref
let classification_lock = Rwmutex.create pref
let delegation_lock = Rwmutex.create pref
let position_lock = Rwmutex.create pref
 &lt;at&gt;  

\section{Base unlocking}

Helper function [[unlock_a_base]] is used to unlock [[lock]] with
[[desired]] unlocking.

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let unlock_a_base desired lock =
  match desired with
  | Read_lock -&gt; Rwmutex.read_unlock lock
  | Write_lock -&gt; Rwmutex.write_unlock lock
  | No_lock -&gt; ()
 &lt;at&gt;  

Function [[create_unlock]] returns a function that, when called,
unlocks the bases as specified in the [[what]] argument.

\nextchunklabel{code:create_unlock}
&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let create_unlock what =
  fun () -&gt; 
    unlock_a_base what.position position_lock;
    unlock_a_base what.delegation delegation_lock;
    unlock_a_base what.classification classification_lock;
    unlock_a_base what.participant participant_lock
 &lt;at&gt;  

\section{Base locking}

Helper function [[lock_a_base]] is used to lock [[lock]] with
[[desired]] locking.

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let lock_a_base desired lock =
  match desired with
  | Read_lock -&gt; Rwmutex.read_lock lock
  | Write_lock -&gt; Rwmutex.write_lock lock
  | No_lock -&gt; ()
 &lt;at&gt;  

Function [[lock_bases]] is called to lock bases. The [[what]] argument
gives for each base the desired locking. This function returns a
function that should be called to unlock the bases.

To avoid deadlocks, the locking order is the reverse as used in the
unlocking procedure (see \codechunkref{code:create_unlock}).

&lt;&lt;basesctrl.ml&gt;&gt;=
let lock_bases what =
  lock_a_base what.participant participant_lock;
  lock_a_base what.classification classification_lock;
  lock_a_base what.delegation delegation_lock;
  lock_a_base what.position position_lock;
  create_unlock what
 &lt;at&gt;  

Best wishes,
david

As suggested by Rich Jones, here is a better description of this new 
syntax extension:

                   pa_bounds syntax extension
                   ==========================

Location-specific reports of out-of-bounds accesses in arrays, strings and 
bigarrays.

<a href="http://martin.jambon.free.fr/ocaml.html#bounds">http://martin.jambon.free.fr/ocaml.html#bounds</a>

What it provides:
----------------
The default behavior of out-of-bounds array, string or bigarray accesses
is to raise the Invalid_argument exception, with no information on where
the faulty access was attempted.
This Camlp4 module provides a special syntax which allows the illegal
accesses to be reported accurately, by indicating the location
in the source code. The same exception, Invalid_argument, is raised, but
its argument is a string which contains that information.

The syntax:
----------
Replace the dot (.) by the number sign (#), e.g.:

     native             extension
     a.(i)              a#(i)
     a.(i) &lt;- e         a#(i) &lt;- e
     s.[i]              s#[i]
     s.[i] &lt;- c         s#[i] &lt;- c
     big.{i,j}          big#{i,j}
     big.{i,j} &lt;- x     big#{i,j} &lt;- x

It should also work with the revised syntax, where ":=" replaces "&lt;-".

Options:
-------

-native
   The native behavior can be restored without changing the program by
   passing the -native option to the preprocessor. For unsafe access
   without bound checking, this option must be used in addition to the
   -unsafe option that can be passed to the compiler (ocamlopt or ocamlc).

Installation:
------------
Install Findlib and P4ck, and then install it from P4ck.
Alternatively, you can compile the extension as follows:
   camlp4o -o ocamlc -c \
          -pp 'camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo -loc _loc' \
          -I +camlp4 pa_bounds.ml

See <a href="http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/compiling_ocaml_projects">http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/compiling_ocaml_projects</a> for
information on how to compile programs that use Camlp4 extensions.

&gt; I was wondering about the best way to create a stream
&gt; from a remote file for which I have the URL
&gt; 
&gt; open Http_client
&gt; open Stream
&gt; 
&gt; let body = Stream.of_string Convenience.http_get
&gt; "<a href="http://dfl.sjsu.edu">http://dfl.sjsu.edu</a>";;
&gt; 
&gt; Is the content of body downloaded completely before
&gt; being streamed(which defeats the purpose of streams)
&gt; or not? and if not how can I get the content of an URL
&gt; gradually (without getting the whole body into
&gt; memory)?

Yes, Convenience.http_get always downloads the whole body into a string.

For a stream-like download, you must use the pipeline interface. For
example, to store the body into a file do:

let call = new get "<a href="http://dfl.sjsu.edu">http://dfl.sjsu.edu</a>" in
call # set_response_body_storage (`File (fun () -&gt; "filename"));
let pipeline = new pipeline in
pipeline # set_proxy_from_environment();
pipeline # add call;
pipeline # run()

Now check call#status whether the HTTP request was successfully
responded.

If you want to postprocess the body while it is downloaded, things will
get more complicated. In particular, it is possible to store the body in
an object that fulfils the Netmime.mime_body class type. Netclient
invokes the open_value_wr method and outputs into this netchannel. Using
this mechanism to define a callback-style interface (i.e. a function is
called whenever a chunk of data arrives) can be implemented in a
straight-forward manner.

If you really need a "string Stream.t": This is possible because
Netclient is programmed in an event-driven way, but is very difficult,
because you must arrange a so-called control inversion. This is
absolutely non-trivial but implementable in less than 100 lines of code.
