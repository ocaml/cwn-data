Continuing this old thread, Konstantin Olkhovskiy said
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  I've stumbled upon a library that implements linear types for OCaml,
  using monads, lens and some ppx to make it more lightweight. Might be
  of interest: <https://github.com/keigoi/linocaml>

  It is the part of even more interesting system - [OCaml MPST]
  (Multiparty Session Types) See the [slides].

Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni then said

  (The paper linked on that page is dated 2011/2014. In case anyone
  wonders whether the authors have found a time machine in a barn to be
  able to cite papers from 2018, there just seems to be an error in the
  preparation. It is freshly published, and a PDF with correct dates is
  available [here].)

  I'm doing a short update here as Oali has seen some significant
  changes. This update is also the last one here to avoid being too
  annoying, and also since I won't be add too much new stuff to Oali in
  foreseeable future.

  Major changes since last time
  • SaltStack files and script files (or profiles) now live in a
    separate [repo]
    • Oali accepts custom profile repo URL to facilitate using your own
      SaltStack files without forking Oali itself
  • Semi self-documentation
    • Added mechanism to facilitate inline documentation inside
      `oali.ml' itself
    • The generated markdown doc is stored as [OALI_DOC] in repo, it
      lists all the steps (or tasks) Oali does, along with descriptions
  • Added LVM support
    • Works with all 3 disk layouts, and encryption
    • See [here] for details on added logical volumes
  • Answer remembering of dialogues when appropriate
    • Relatively static answers (e.g. hostname, whether to use
      encryption, LVM) are stored in `oali_answers' directory, with a
      JSON file for each task
    • The "answer store" can be used in new session of Oali. The old
      answer store is wiped accordingly if user changes their answer.
  • Added SSH server setup and public key transfer code (ported from old
    server bash script)
    • See [here] for details
    • Mainly useful for when you have (virtual) console access to live
      CD/Oali install screen, and want to add needed public key to the
      user's `.ssh/authorized_keys' via network instead of loading from
      physical medium

  I've used Oali to install in various configurations in past couple of
  days, and have yet to notice major defects. That being said, exercise
  caution as you would for installing an OS.
