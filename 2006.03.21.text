1) Camomile-0.6.5
Archive: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.caml.general/32571>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yoriyuki Yamagata announced:

I'm pleased to announce Camomile-0.6.5, a comprehensive Unicode
library for OCaml.  This is a bug fix release.  Up to previous
version, collation rules without a header was just ignored.
This problem affects, for example, Scandinavian languages.  This
release fixes this problem.

You can download the new release from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/camomile>

In addition, I'm looking for a maintainer for Godi-package for
Camomile.  Or someone already adopted it?  I'm too busy, and besides,
I almost forget how to make Godi-package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Luc Maranget announced:

Our team (Moscova, Inria Rocquencourt, France) proposes a
post-doctoral fellow position.

Basically, the work we propose is first  to release the new version of
JoCaml, our extension of Objective Caml with Join-calculus primitives,
and then to study and implement en extension to the existing
prototype, such as type safe serialization.

Application deadline is March 30th.

Candidates must have defended their thesis before September 1, 2006.

More details on the application process are available at
<http://www.inria.fr/travailler/opportunites/postdoc/postdoc.en.html>
A short description of the position is given at the end of this mail.

In any case, candidates should contact me (Luc.Maranget@inria.fr)

==================================================
Position description

* Environnement
Jocaml is an extension of Ocaml based on the Join-calculus,
see <http://join.inria.fr>. There are already two releases of the
Join-calculus and Jocaml. A third version, simplified and better
integrated to the Ocaml compiler, is almost completed.
It remains to seriously test the prototype, to write some examples
and documentation.

Additionally we plan to integrate some some important extensions, such
as type safe marshalling or matching by regular term expressions.

* Missions
With Moscova project-team, the post-doctorant will test and this new
release of Jocaml, and set its diffusion on the web. The
post-doctorant will probably have enough time to study and
implement an extension of JoCaml, such as type safe marshalling or
matching by regular term expressions.

* Ideal candidate
The post-doctorant should have a good knowledge of the programming
languages theory, and, if possible, of concurrency theory. The work
will also consist in a good part of programming within distributed
systems. This work is adequate for an expert in theory who wants to
have some practical experience, or for a very good programmer (in
operating systems or compilers) who wants to gain experience in
programming under control of theory.

5) Severe loss of performance due to new signal handling

** Markus Mottl asked:

This report has also been posted to the OCaml bug tracker, but since it is a
surprising observation, it may be good if people on the list know that it
exists without having to search the bug tracker archive.  Maybe some assembler
guru can repeat this result and explain to us what's going on...

----------

It seems that changes to signal handling between OCaml 3.08.4 and 3.09.1 can
lead to a very significant loss of performance (up to several orders of
magnitude!) in code that uses threads and performs I/O (tested on Linux).

The attached file (slow.ml) demonstrates this: it prints a character to stdout
in a for-loop. The uploaded version will take approximately 600ms in native
code to complete this test when redirecting output to /dev/null.  If you
comment out the line containing "module X = Thread" and compile without thread
support, then the test suddenly only takes around 1.5ms, i.e. it runs 400 times
faster.

Profiling using oprofile revealed that the function
"caml_process_pending_signals" seems to be responsible for that.  Annotated
assembler output showed that the code was sampled an astonishing number of
times in the instruction "test %eax,%eax" as obviously generated for "if
(async_action != NULL)" in this function. This is really weird, because
everything else seems to be sampled a sensible number of times, but it would
surely explain the timings.

OCaml-3.08.4 does not exhibit any problems of that kind.

slow.ml:

open Unix
open Printf

module X = Thread

let () =
  let t1 = gettimeofday () in
  for i = 1 to 100000 do
    print_char '.';
  done;
  let t2 = gettimeofday () in
  eprintf "%f\n" (t2 -. t1);

Short explanation: atomic instructions are dog slow.

Longer explanation:

OCaml 3.09 fixed a number of long-standing bugs in signal handling
that could cause signals to be "lost" (not acted upon).  The fixes,
located mostly in the code that polls for pending signals
(caml_process_pending_signals), rely on an atomic "read-and-clear"
operation, implemented using atomic processor instructions on x86,
x86-64 and PPC.  This makes signal handling correct (no signal can be
lost) but I didn't realize that it has such an impact on performance,
even on a uniprocessor machine.  Thanks for pointing this out.

(To prevent a number of well-meaning but irrelevant posts, keep in
mind that we're using atomic instructions in a single-threaded
program, to get atomicity w.r.t. signals, not w.r.t. concurrent threads.
We don't need the latter kind of atomicity given OCaml's threading model.)

Now, you may wonder why the problem appears mainly with threaded
programs.  The reason is that programs linked with the Thread library,
even if they do not create threads, check for signals much more
often, because they enter and leave blocking sections more often.  In
your example, each call to "print_char" needs to lock and unlock the
stdout channel, causing two signal polls each time.

So, it's time to go back to the drawing board.  Fortunately, it
appears that reliable polling of signals is possible without atomic
processor instructions.  Expect a fix in 3.09.2 at the latest, and
probably within a couple of weeks in the CVS.

The problem is the following: The O'Caml runtime cannot handle signals
immediately because this would break memory management (e.g. imagine a
signal happens when memory has just been allocated but not initialized).
To get around this the signal handler sets just a flag, and the compiler
emits instructions that regularly check this flag at safe points of
execution (i.e. memory is known to be initialised). These instructions
are now atomic in 3.09. In 3.08, you have basically

if "flag is set" then (
  (*)
  "clear flag";
  "call the signal handler function"
)

If another signal happens at (*) it will be lost.

As you mention sigprocmask: Of course, you can block signals before
checking the flag and allow them again after clearing it, but this would
be even _much_ slower than the solution in 3.09, because sigprocmask
needs a context switch to do its work (it is a kernel function).

I don't know what Xavier has in mind to solve the problem, but I would
think about reducing the frequency of the atomic check.
This could work as follows:

- Revert the check to the 3.08 solution
- Use the alarm clock timer to regularly call a signal_manager
  function at a certain frequency (i.e. the signal flag is set
  at a certain frequency)
- Only the alarm clock timer signal is left unblocked. The
  other signals are normally blocked.
- In signal_manager, it is checked whether there are other
  pending signals, and if so, their functions are called.

Of course, it is again possible that alarm clock signals are lost, but
this is harmless, because it is a repeatedly emitted signal. The other
signals cannot be lost, but their execution is deferred to the next
alarm clock event.

They have been included for a long time. New is Thread.sigmask.

Actually, the problematic code in 3.08 is:

   tmp <- flag;
   (*)
   flag <- 0;
   if (tmp) { process the signal; }

and indeed a signal can be lost (never processed) if it occurs at (*).

The solution I have in mind is to implement exactly the pseudocode you
give above.  If a signal occurs at (*), it is not lost (the signal
handler function will be called just afterwards!), just conflated with
a previous occurrence of that signal, but this is fair game: POSIX
signals have the same behaviour.  (Yes, I'm ignoring the queueing
behaviour of realtime POSIX signals.)

Note however that in 3.09 and in my proposed fix, there is one flag
per signal, which still improves over 3.08 (which had only one shared
flag) and ensures that two occurrences of different signals are not
conflated, again as per POSIX.

That would be plan C, plan B being making the check even more efficient.
I'd rather not introduce timer signals if at all possible, though,
since these mess up many function calls.

transactions fast with low latency, etc, the paper

Atomic heap transactions and fine-grain interrupts by Olin Shivers,
James W. Clark and Roland McGrath:
<http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/~shivers/papers/heap.ps>

presents several *neat* hacks to do this efficiently.  I'm sure that
the implementators on the list are already aware of this work, but I
just wanted to point it out as interesting reading for people (like
myself) who think this stuff is neat but don't necessarily have broad
experience with it.
