  The OCaml Software Foundation is developing the teaching platform
  Learn-OCaml that provides auto-graded exercises for OCaml, and was
  initially authored by OCamlPro for the OCaml MOOC:
  <https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml/>

  The platform is free software and easy to deploy; this is great, but
  as a result we keep learning of users/deployments that we had no idea
  of. We would be interested in having a better view of our
  user-base. If you use Learn-OCaml as a teacher, could you answer this
  email (To: e.mdorel@gmail.com) and let us know?

  Ideally we would like to know:

  • Where are you using Learn-OCaml?  → in which university (in a
    specific course?), or in which company, online community or … ?
  • How many students/learners use your deployment in a year?

  Also FYI:

  • For an example of Learn-OCaml instance, see
    <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/interesting-ocaml-exercises-from-francois-pottier-available-online/7050>
  • Last October we had a 0.13.0 release, full of new features:
    <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-sf-learn-ocaml-0-13-0/8577>
  • For any question related to Learn-OCaml, feel free to create a
    discussion topic on <https://discuss.ocaml.org/> , category
    Community, tag /learn-ocaml/.
  • And if need be, opening an issue in
    <https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml/issues> if of course warmly
    welcome as well.


A SOCKS implementation for OCaml

Renato Alencar announced

  I have been working on a SOCKS implementation for OCaml and specially
  for MirageOS. It's not really complete or stable yet (not even
  published), it only has a couple of proof of concepts on the examples
  directory and it doesn't integrate with the well known libraries of
  the ecosystem.

  I would like to ask for feedback, and some thoughts about how could we
  have that in Conduit and Cohttp for example, so It'd be just plugged
  in into those libraries without having to directly depending on it. I
  plan to implement that for those libraries and have it submitted
  upstream, but not without some clear thoughts about how to make a
  clear interface for that.

  Besides being sloppy, I have a few issues described on GitHub, and it
  should be addressed on the next few days. Anyone is welcome to discuss
  those issues as some of them are still foggy for me, and having some
  other views on that would be great.
