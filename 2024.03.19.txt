dune 3.14
═════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-14/14096/7>


Marek Kubica announced
──────────────────────

  We're happy to announce that Dune 3.14.2 is now available.

  Note that due to a regression that was detected before publishing to
  opam version `3.14.1' should not be used. The fix for the regression
  is part of this release.

  This feature brings some small bugfixes around the handling of Coq as
  well as solves an issue where Dune is running on Windows in a path
  that contains Unicode characters. This affected e.g. users with
  diacritics or non-latin script in their name when running Dune within
  their home directory.

  • When a directory is changed to a file, correctly remove it in
    subsequent `dune build' runs. (#9327, fix #6575, @emillon)
  • Fix a problem with the doc-new target where transitive dependencies
    were missed during compile. This leads to missing expansions in the
    output docs.  (#9955, @jonludlam)
  • coq: fix performance regression in coqdep unescaping (#10115, fixes
    #10088, @ejgallego, thanks to Dan Christensen for the report)
  • coq: memoize coqdep parsing, this will reduce build times for Coq
    users, in particular for those with many .v files (#10116,
    @ejgallego, see also #10088)
  • on Windows, use an unicode-aware version of `CreateProcess' to avoid
    crashes when paths contains non-ascii characters. (#10212, fixes
    #10180, @emillon)
  • fix compilation on non-glibc systems due to `signal.h' not being
    pulled in spawn stubs. (#10256, @emillon)


Announcing OCaml Manila Meetups

Thibaut Mattio announced
────────────────────────

  I'm thrilled to announce the OCaml Manila Meetup!

  Seeing that OCaml doesn't seem to have reached the Philippines just
  yet (I wasn't able to find existing OCaml or FP communities), the goal
  is to build one, starting small, with a few people meeting every month
  in a coffee to hack on fun projects, and letting it grow organically.

  The inaugural event is scheduled for the 4th of April:
  <https://www.meetup.com/ocaml-manila/events/299786391/>

  If you're living in Manila, or if you know anyone who would be
  interested in joining, please don't hesitate to reach out!

  I would also greatly appreciate retweets if you happen to be on
  Twitter: <https://twitter.com/tmattio_/status/1768169167004577997>

  Happy hacking!

OCaml 4.14.2 released
═════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-14-2-released/14308/1>


octachron announced
───────────────────

  We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Grace Chisholm
  Young by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.14.2.

  This release is a collection of safe bug fixes, cherry-picked from the
  OCaml 5 branch.  If you are still using OCaml 4.14 and cannot yet
  upgrade to OCaml 5, this release is for you.

  The 4.14 branch is expected to receive updates for at least one year,
  while the OCaml 5 branch is stabilising.

  Thus don't hesitate to report any bugs on the OCaml issue tracker (at
  <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues>).

  See the list of changes below for more details.


Installation Instructions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the
  following commands:

  ┌────
  │ opam update
  │ opam switch create 4.14.2
  └────

  The source code for the release candidate is also directly available
  on:

Docfd 3.0.0: TUI multiline fuzzy document finder

  Archive:

Darren announced
────────────────

  Hi all, I am happy to announce Docfd 3.0.0, which adds a
  non-interactive search mode and support of DOCXs and other file
  formats via `pandoc', as well as many polishes.

  [Repo]

  Think interactive grep for text files, PDFs, DOCXs, etc, but
  word/token based instead of regex and line based, so you can search
  across lines easily.

  Docfd aims to provide good UX via integration with common text editors
  and PDF viewers, so you can jump directly to a search result with a
  single key press.

Claire Vandenberghe announced
─────────────────────────────

  I’m reaching out to request a few minutes of your time to review the
  wireframe for the OCaml community area. Following user interviews with
  those unfamiliar with OCaml, we gathered insights on what would be
  helpful for you landing on the community page.

  As a result, we’re restructuring aspects of the pages and content on
  the landing page. This is a wireframe, so the focus is on checking the
  navigation, layout, and content, not the User Interface (UI).

  Your feedback are needed at this stage, and please feel free to leave
  comments directly on Figma, via email, or let’s schedule a quick
  call. Thank you for participating in this review. Have a great day and
  week ahead.

Opam-repository: Updated documentation, retirement and call for maintainers
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-repository-updated-documentation-retirement-and-call-for-maintainers/14325/1>


Kate announced
──────────────

  After having been maintainer of opam-repository for the past 6 and
  half years, I'm publicly announcing my retirement from it, to focus on
  opam itself. This change has been more or less already in effect since
  September last year (following a burnout) and I have since been
  working on writing enough documentation so that my move away from
  opam-repository can be as smooth as possible.

  This documentation is now live in:
  • [CONTRIBUTING.md]: documentation at destination of package
    maintainers. This document has been rewritten in hopes of being more
    helpful for beginner and well as experimented publishers.
  • the [opam-repository wiki], which now also includes:
    ‣ a [FAQ]
    ‣ [informations about the infrastructure]
    ‣ a [governance / points of contacts] document
    ‣ a helper on [How To deal with CI]
    ‣ a list of all the [current policies] i could think of, as well as
      their reasoning and exceptions. These policies were previously
      mostly passed down orally, most of them have been in place since
      the very beginning
    ‣ several documents at destination of current opam-repository
      maintainers and opam-repository maintainers in training, all
      freely accessible for the curious eyes (although rereading them
      now, i will admit those documents are not my finest work, as they
      were the first ones i wrote in the past 6 months 🙈)

  Any improvements to these documents are also welcome. To contribute
  simply open a PR on opam-repository, or a ticket on the
  [opam-repository bugtracker] to contribute to the wiki.

  Hopefully, all these documents are a solid enough base so that they
  get updated as time goes on, by current and future opam-repository
  maintainers.

  I'm also writing this post to call for said future opam-repository
  maintainers: if you want to become a maintainer, feel free to contact
  @mseri and @raphael-proust. I do recommend the experience of working
  with them on opam-repository 😊

DkCoder 0.1.0
═════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dkcoder-0-1-0/14327/1>


jbeckford announced
───────────────────

  I wrote an article [DkCoder: Intro to Scripting] that describes a very
  early cut of OCaml-ified scripting:

        Hello Builder! Scripting is a small, free and important
        piece of DkSDK. Walk with me as we use the DkSDK tool
        "*DkCoder*" to write little scripts that become
        full-fledged programs. My hope is that /within minutes/
        you feel like your dev experience is as productive as in
        Python, but enhanced so you:

        1. have nothing to install except Git and optionally
           Visual Studio Code
        2. have safe and understandable code ("static typing")


  DkCoder is a transparently installed OCaml 4.14 environment with one
  API: run a script. It shouldn't be confused with conventional OCaml
  distributions, although underneath DkCoder has the conventional
  bytecode binaries¹, and `dune' and `ocamllsp'.

  No C compiler, Cygwin/MSYS2, Homebrew or MacPorts are needed. Please
  skim the article for the exact Windows/macOS/Linux requirements.

  It grew out of two things:
  1. My frustrations sharing scripts with others. It was easy for
     inter-dependencies between scripts to break POSIX shell scripts
     (the basis of the DkML installer) and CMake scripts (most of my
     tools).
  2. My need to have a good delivery vehicle for my own software.

  Please don't do anything major with DkCoder yet. In fact, if you think
  you'll be using DkCoder for your own scripts or your own software,
  please send me a message so I can prioritize/deprioritize.

  I'd like to thank @octachron for the [codept analyzer]. It is lightly
  used now but as hinted in the Security section of the article it will
  become much more important. And also thanks to the projects that have
  fixed their newly discovered bytecode-only bugs over the past two
  months.

  ¹: Actually, I bundle a new binary called `ocamlrunx' which is a
  DT_NEEDED/LC_LOAD_DYLIB re-linking of `ocamlrun' against all the C
  libraries (`ffi', `SDL2*' and their deps today) to get macOS and Linux
  bytecode working.

Continuing this thread, Mathieu Barbin announced
────────────────────────────────────────────────

  I've recently pushed updates to the [vcs] public repo with most of the
  contents of my early draft.  For those interested in early
  experimentation, I've created a release on my custom opam-repository.

  The interface is still very a work in progress, but you can already
  see how the pieces fit together. In particular, the [provider]
  component, which is crucial for the dynamic dispatch implementation of
  `vcs', is now available on opam. The `vcs' project serves as a good
  real-world example of the capabilities this provides.

  Please feel free to open issues on GitHub with general feedback,
  requests, or to start a discussion.

  @kopecs, I don't have a precise timeline for an initial publication on
  opam yet. I've created this [milestone] if you'd like to follow the
  progress or leave a comment. Thank you for your interest!

  @paurkedal: Your setup has been a great source of inspiration for me,
  and I've found it incredibly helpful. Thank you so much!

  @samoht: I chose the approach that felt most comfortable for this
  particular project, but I greatly appreciate your input. I'll
  definitely keep your suggestions in mind for future projects. Thanks!
