Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, for the week of October 23 to 30, 2012.

1) OCaml-bitcoin 1.0
2) Bolt 1.4 release
3) opam and versions
4) Other Caml News

========================================================================
1) OCaml-bitcoin 1.0
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-10/msg00151.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Dario Teixeira announced:

OCaml-bitcoin is a library offering an OCaml interface to the official
Bitcoin client API. It works by making JSON-RPC calls over the network
to a running Bitcoin daemon offering the client API. The project's
homepage can be found here:

<http://ocaml-bitcoin.forge.ocamlcore.org/>

Bitcoin has been a controversial subject, to say the least. With this
in mind, I've written a blog post that hopefully clarifies my view on
the subject. It also contains some technical information concerning
the implementation of OCaml-bitcoin:

<http://nleyten.com/post/2012/10/24/Announcing-OCaml-bitcoin-1.0>

To summarise: the release of this library should not be construed as
an unconditional support of Bitcoin in its current form. There is
enough potential in the idea, however, to warrant some guarded
support.

2) Bolt 1.4 release

- API change: updated support for Pajé format (version 1.2.3)
- support for '&&' and '||' in filters (new configuration format only)
- new 'minimal' layout using only message
- new 'bell' output writing the bell character on the standard output
- new 'say' output using MacOS X text-to-speech
- support for Growl under Windows
- bug#86: '-ocaml-prefix' doesn't really work
- bug#87: install shouldn't build anything
- bug#89: do not activate warnings by default
- bug#105: crashes with 'Not_found' when both BOLT_FILE and BOLT_CONFIG are not set
- bug#107: when using syntax extension with level NONE, preprocessed code

Before the 1.0 release my plan is:
* to remove the unstable packages in the main opam-repository (ie. every
packages should have a stable tarball with a fixed checksum) [1]
* add a way to specify commits/branches for unstable packages if needed. [2]

The current workaround is, as Anil pointed out, to clone opam-repository, use
'opam-mk-repo' at its root to generate a local mirror of opam.ocamlpro.com,
and tell opam to add the local repository as a remote: 'opam remote -add
local /path/to/your/local/repository'

Then 'opam remote -list' should display the list of repositories and their
respective priority (higher is better). You can also tweak ~/.opam/repo/index
manually to tell opam to use your local repository only for some packages,
for instance the unstable ones (don't forget to run 'opam update' after
changing the index file).

For [1], I'm gladly accepting external contributions (for [2] as well
actually if someone really wants to hack into opam).
