In the spirit of "release early, release often", we therefore announce the 
first release of Vprint, a runtime value printer module for OCaml. Be warned, 
the module is extremely experimental at the moment, and the implementation is 
very hasty (I got the main idea yesterday when finalising my GSoc project and 
now it's here). So be ready to encounter stupid errors and even core dump, but 
do remember to send me a message about that so I can improve. Here is the 
introduction from README: 

DESCRIPTION 
=========== 

Vprint is a value printer module for OCaml. It prints any value at running time 
with a simple generic printer. It can be used for the following purposes: help 
debugging, inspect data representation, test type casting, runtime dispatch 
based on type representations and avoid writing pretty printers. 

  - Help debugging. 

    For rapid development reason, we don't want to write a printer/formatter 
    function for each data type. Moreover, even if we've got the printers for 
    each type, specifying printers to inspect the running time values, which 
    are usually the arbitrary combinations (tuple, list, variants, objects 
    etc.) of them, is still tedious. 

  - Inspect data representation 

    The module can shows you all kinds of data (of different types) that having 
    the same memory layout as a input data. 

  - Test type casting 

    By printing a value with the format of another type, it can help to test 
    whether a data can be safely cast to another type without actually doing 
    it. But be warned, the real casting can still fail even if the printing 
    successes. 

  - Runtime dispatch based on type representations 

    In the same spirit as above. 

  - Avoid writing pretty printers (TODO) 

    Without considering debugging, sometimes you still need to output the 
    values of some data type. If you don't care much about the format and just 
    want the result shew, then you probably don't have to write it by your own 
    now; if the OCaml toplevel printer is something you'd like, we're on the 
    way there, if given more time. 

FEATURES 
======== 

There are just two main functions "print" and "print_all" (and their 
output-to-string version "sprint" and "sprint_all") 

    val print: ?fmt:fmt -&gt; 'a -&gt; unit 
    val print_all: ?fmt:fmt -&gt; 'a -&gt; unit 

The "print" function can prints any data with a generic printer. However, it's 
well-known fact that OCaml runtime doesn't carry type information, so the 
output maybe too generic to read sometimes, e.g. the representation of list is 
something like a linked pairs. 

The implementation tries to inference the actual data type, however due to the 
theoretical limitation, there do exist many cases where the output is not 
satisfactory such as the list/pair example. And we don't believe it's 
appropriate to just choose a probable result based on probabilities, because 
misleading is even worse. (1, (2, (3, (4, (5, (6, 0)))))) is mostly likely to 
be a list, but not necessarily. 

In such cases, you can give more hints to the system by using the optional ~fmt 
parameters. The format of fmt is very close to type representation and supports 
combination, so it's quite easy to write (check example section). Besides it 
accepts the default arguments "__" (means "anything") and try its best to 
inference more information based on the less information being given, so you 
don't have to write every details. 

In such as sense, fmt can be used as a simpler formatter if you want to pretty 
print some values as output but is lazy to write complex formatter, just gives 
more specific fmt information if you want better effect. For now, we use rather 
simple string output function, but we'll definitely move to Format and build 
better output a la OCaml's toplevel output. 

You can also use "print" to do preliminary tests of type casting. By printing 
value x of type t with a fmt associated with type t', you get more confidence 
to cast x to type t', instead of making real casting and get core dump, here 
you only get a Fmt_Error exception. I believe you've been warned it's not 
definitive, but the point is that the function can help you to rule out a lot 
possibilities beforehand. 

In the same spirit, you can use the function to do runtime dispatch based on 
type representations (not types! it's like representation level duck 
typing). E.g, something like (not tested yet) 

    open Vprint 
    let o = input_value ch in 
    try ignore (sprint ~fmt:_s o); do_sth_to_o_as_string 
    with Fmt_Error _ -&gt; 
      try ignore (sprint ~fmt:_f o); do_sth_to_o_as_float 
      with Fmt_Error _ -&gt; 
        try ignore (sprint ~fmt:_l_ o); do_sth_to_o_as_list 
        with Fmt_Error _ -&gt; ...... 

Finally, the "print_all" function can help you to inspect the representation of 
data, especially it lists all the data (of any types) that having the same 
memory representation as a value. For example, when you print a value with the 
default formatter: "print v", the output is so generic that won't satisfy 
you. Then you may wonder why the output is so generic? You can get the answer 
with "print_all v", then you'll see all kinds of values which having the same 
memory representation as your input "v", that's why the system won't be able to 
decide which one of them is the "v" hence print less meaningful result. 

INSTALL 
======= 

It's a simple module, just compile the source to cmo/cmx to use.  The source 
itself makes use of camlp4 (just for stream function), so compile it with 
option "-pp camlp4o". The result modules doesn't depend on camlp4, so you don't 
have to specify the camlp4 option when you make use of vprint. 

We also provide Makefile script with  the following command: make all, make 
install, make doc, make clean, make uninstall. 

Only tested under the following environment: Linux, OCaml 3.10.0, GNU Make 3.81.

functional programming and functional programming languages, 
particularly strongly typed languages such as OCaml, Haskell, SML, etc. 

The first meeting will be Thursday, September 13th at 7:30pm somewhere

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bayfp">http://groups.google.com/group/bayfp</a>
