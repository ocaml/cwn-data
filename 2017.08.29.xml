      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-08/msg00055.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Yann Hamdaoui announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Dear OCamlers, I'm happy to announce the (almost first) release of Mechaml
1.0.0 on OPAM.
A version 0.1 exists but 1.0.0 should be considered as the first usable
release.

Mechaml is a functional web scraping library that allows to :
* Fetch web content
* Analyze, fill and submit HTML forms
* Handle cookies, headers and redirections

Mechaml is built on top of existing libraries that provide low-level
features : Cohttp and
Lwt for asynchronous I/O and HTTP handling, and
Lambdasoup to parse HTML. It provides
an interface that handles the interactions between these and add a few
other features.

Please refer to the https://github.com/yannham/mechaml for more
information, examples and documentation.

      <cwn_title>Open 18-month Postdoc Position on Frama-C/E-ACSL</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-08/msg00070.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Julien Signoles announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The Software Security Lab at CEA LIST (Paris Saclay, France) is hiring a
18-month postdoc to improve the Frama-C runtime verification plug-in
E-ACSL. Knowledge in at least one of the following fields is required:
- OCaml programming (at least, functional programming)
- C programming
- runtime verification
- compilation
- static analysis
- semantics of programming languages (in particular, the ISO C99
programming language)
- formal specification

A full description of the open position is available online:
        http://julien.signoles.free.fr/eacsl_postdoc.pdf

Feel free to contact me for additional details,
Julien Signoles

      <cwn_title>BuckleScript 1.9: namespace support and better error message</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-08/msg00072.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Bob Zhang announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
BuckleScript is an optimizing compiler for OCaml to generate readable
_javascript_, it is open sourced by Bloomberg [1] (also supported by
Facebook ReasonML team).

Two major changes brought by this release:
1. Namespace support. Unlike most existing implementations, the namespace
support is non leaky which means you have and only have one way to  access
`Pkg.A`, the build system makes full use of concurrency, it is highly
performant and scalable.

2. Better error message, this is mostly brought by Facebook ReasonML team,
they wrote a blog about it [2]

A non complete list of changes are listed here:
https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#190

BuckleScript is indeed growing quickly these days [3], there is a large
chance that we can make it reasonably popular and reach a 10x larger
audience, contributions  are much appreciated.

Documentation is available here:
http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html

To install:
npm install -g bs-platform

Happy hacking in OCaml! -- Hongbo
