* pyml_bindgen: a CLI app to generate Python bindings directly from OCaml value specifications
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-pyml-bindgen-a-cli-app-to-generate-python-bindings-directly-from-ocaml-value-specifications/8786/6

** Ryan Moore announced


*** New releases

Version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 are now available on [[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tags][GitHub]].  0.3.0
has been merged into opam, and a PR for 0.3.1 has been opened.  The [[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md][change
log]] has more details about the changes.

*** Binding tuples

You can now bind tuples directly.  Here's a Python function that takes two lists of points (where each "point" is a
tuple like ~(x, y)~) and adds them together

#+begin_src python
def add(points1, points2):
    return [(x1 + y1, x2 + y2) for (x1, x2), (y1, y2) in zip(points1, points2)]
#+end_src

And you could bind it using tuples from the OCaml side as well.

#+begin_src ocaml
val add : points1:(int * int) list -> points2:(int * int) list -> unit -> (int * int) list
#+end_src

Note there are some restrictions regarding tuples, which you can read about
[[https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_python_bindgen/tuples/][here]],
[[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/blob/main/examples/README.md][here]], or
[[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#030-2022-03-18][here]].

*** Attributes

You can use attributes on value specifications.  Currently the only one supported is ~py_fun_name~, which allows you
to decouple the Python method name and the generated OCaml function name.

As an example, take the following Python function, which adds to "things".

#+begin_src python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
#+end_src

You could bind multiple OCaml functions to this single function now.

#+begin_src ocaml
val add_int : x:int -> y:int -> unit -> int
[@@py_fun_name add]

val add_float : x:float -> y:float -> unit -> float
[@@py_fun_name add]

val add_string : x:string -> y:string -> unit -> string
[@@py_fun_name add]
#+end_src

**** Python magic methods

This is also nice for binding Python [[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames][magic
methods]]. For example, you don't have to use
~__init__~ as the name of the OCaml function you use to make instances of a Python class.  You can bind it to a more
natural name like ~create~ or ~make~.

#+begin_src ocaml
val create : name:string -> age:int -> unit -> t
[@@py_fun_name __init__]
#+end_src

*** Using Pytypes.pyobject directly

Sometimes you may not want to bother converting Python types to normal OCaml types at all.  You can do that now in
value specifications by using the ~Pytypes.pyobject~ and ~Py.Object.t~ types directly.

*** Fewer dependencies

~re~ is now used instead of ~re2~, which drops the number of dependencies that need to be installed by about half.
Additionally, ~core~, ~core_bench~, and ~bisect_ppx~ don't need to be installed if you want to install ~pyml_bindgen~
directly from the git repository, which greatly cuts the required dependencies in this case.

Thanks again to UnixJunkie for spurring many of these updates!

** Deep in this thread, Aya announced


@pitag and I have resubmitted the PPX derivers project for this Summer 2022 round: *Expand OCaml's library of
standard derivers*! This is the same project I was the intern for this past Winter 2022 round, where the goal is to
build up a [[https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/standard_derivers][standard derivers]] library, like ~ppx_deriving~, using
the updated ~ppxlib~ API.

I'm excited to be supporting @pitag with mentoring, and for the opportunity to stay involved now that my internship
has ended :smiley:

:CUSTOM_ID: 4

** "Petter A. Urkedal announced


I am happy to announce the second release of [[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti][Caqti]] this year. The reason
for the quick succession is partly an adjustment to the [[https://paurkedal.github.io/ocaml-caqti/caqti/Caqti_request/Infix/index.html][new API for request
construction]] and partly that
[[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti/issues/72][matchable error conditions]] did not make it into the previous
release.  You can see the full release notes below.

I would also like to thank [[https://ocaml-sf.org][OCaml Software Foundation]] for sponsoring my efforts on the Caqti
project this year, also including most of the work that went into the previous release.

One [[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti/issues/38][feature in progress]] is a new driver based on the pure-OCaml
[[https://github.com/arenadotio/pgx][pgx]] which should make it possible, with some additional changes to the way
drivers are loaded, to target MirageOS. I am note sure if this can be done in a minor release or will require a Caqti
2 branch.

*** Release Notes

New features:

  - A matchable representation of common causes of errors on the database
    side is now available, with limitations.  It focuses on conditions which
    seem most likely useful to handle.  At the moment we lack extended error
    codes from SQLite3 needed to make the cause fully precise.

  - Expose the underlying error details from database client libraries.
    This is meant to be use as a last resort, and requires directly linking
    with the relevant drivers.

  - A second set of request construction operators ~->.~, ~->?~, ~->!~, and
    ~->*~ were introduced after experience with converting existing code.
    Given the parameter and result type they return a function which
    constructs a request directly from a query string.  Avoiding the need to
    compose with ~@:-~ simplifies local opens and usage with ~List.map~ etc.

  - Environment variables are now expanded in the debug log when using the
    new request constructors introduced in 1.7.0.

  - A new ~?tweaks_version~ connection parameter has been added to control
    when the client is ready to adapt to changes in database session
    parameters or other adjustments of the interaction with specific
    database systems. [[[https://paurkedal.github.io/ocaml-caqti/caqti/tweaks.html][More details available in the documentation.]]]

  - Enable foreign key constraint checks for SQLite3 starting at tweaks
    version 1.7.

Fixes:

  - Fixed debug logging to pass the correct driver info to the query
    callback instead of a dummy driver info which would cause a failure if
    unsupported.

Deprecations:

  - The ~-->~ operator was renamed to ~-->!~, with a deprecated alias, for
    consistency with the new ~->!~ operator.

  - The old convenience interface for creating requests has been deprecated
    in favour of the new infix operators and the new query template parser.

  - Documented-only deprecations of ~Caqti_sql_io~, ~Caqti_lwt_sql_io~, and
    ~Caqti_async_sql_io~ have been annotated.
      



* First release of prbnmcn-dagger
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-prbnmcn-dagger/9311/2

** Igarnier announced


I'm proud to announce the release of version 0.0.2 of [[https://github.com/igarnier/prbnmcn-dagger][prbnmcn-dagger]].

This version adds Sequential Monte-Carlo, a.k.a. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter][particle
filters]]-based inference to the library.

Here's the full changelog:
- Dependency: ~prbnmcn-stats.0.0.3~ -> ~prbnmcn-stats.0.0.4~
- Add beta distribution to Gsl samplers
- Refactor Cps monad
- Add SMC inference
- Simplify handler type, modularize effect definitions away from Cps_monad
- Fix typo: bernouilli -> bernoulli (report by @nilsbecker)

I also wrote the following article: [[http://probanomicon.xyz/blog/wind_power_forecast.html][Applying Sequential Monte-Carlo to time series
forecasting]]
It contains some use cases for the library, I hope some find it fun :)

To conclude this post, and as a partial answer to @gasche 's
[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multi-shot-continuations-gone-forever/9072/5][question]] in an older thread, I believe
that unlike some other inference techniques, single-shot continuations are enough to implement SMC. Without getting
into the details, the implementation is very reminiscent of that of lightweight threading libraries. I look forward
to experiment with a fibre-based implementation!
      



* MirageOS 4.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mirageos-4-0/9598/1

** Thomas Gazagnaire announced


*On behalf of the MirageOS team, I am delighted to announce the release of MirageOS 4.0.0!* I'd like to send
special thanks to @dinosaure and @Lortex who drove that release forward for multiple years.

Since the first release of 2013, MirageOS has made steady progress toward deploying a self-managed internet
infrastructure. The project’s initial aim was to self-host as many services as possible
aimed at empowering internet users to securely deploy infrastructure to own their data and take back control of their
privacy. MirageOS can securely deploy [[https://github.com/roburio/unipi][static website hosting]] with “Let’s Encrypt”
certificate provisioning and a [[https://github.com/mirage/ptt][secure SMTPstack]] with security extensions. MirageOS
can also deploy decentralised communication infrastructure like [[https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-matrix][Matrix]],
[[https://github.com/roburio/openvpn][OpenVPN servers]], and [[https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel][TLS tunnels]] to
ensure data privacy or [[https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns][DNS(SEC) servers]] for better authentication.

The protocol ecosystem now contains [[https://github.com/mirage/][hundreds of libraries]] and services
millions of daily users. Over these years, major commercial users have joined the projects. They rely on MirageOS
libraries to keep their products secure. For instance, the MirageOS networking code powers
[[https://www.docker.com/blog/how-docker-desktop-networking-works-under-the-hood/][Docker Desktop’s VPNKit]], which
serves the traffic of millions of containers daily. [[https://www.citrix.com/fr-fr/products/citrix-hypervisor/][Citrix
Hypervisor]] uses MirageOS to interact with Xen, the
hypervisor that powers most of today’s public cloud. [[https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm][Nitrokey]] is
developing a new hardware security module based on MirageOS. [[https://robur.io/][Robur]] develops a unikernel
orchestration system for fleets of MirageOS unikernels. [[https://tarides.com/][Tarides]] uses MirageOS to improve the
[[https://tezos.com/][Tezos]] blockchain, and [[https://hyper.ag/][Hyper]] uses MirageOS to build sensor analytics and an
automation platform for sustainable agriculture.

In the coming weeks, our blog will feature in-depth technical content for the new features that MirageOS brings, as
well as a tour of the existing community and commercial users of MirageOS. Please reach out if you’d like to tell us
about your story.

*** Install MirageOS 4

The easiest way to install MirageOS 4 is by using the opam version 2.1 and `ocaml>=4.12.1`. Follow the [[https://mirage.io/docs/install][installation
guide]] for more details.

#+begin_example
$ opam update
$ opam install 'mirage>4'
#+end_example

/Note/: if you upgrade from MirageOS 3 you will need to manually clean the previous generated files (or call ~mirage
clean~ before upgrading). You would also want to read [[https://mirage.io/docs/breaking-changes][the full list of API
changes]].  You can see unikernel examples in
[[https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton][mirage/mirage-skeleton]],
[[https://github.com/roburio/unikernels][roburio/unikernels]] or
[[https://github.com/tarides/unikernels][tarides/unikernels]].

*** About MirageOS

MirageOS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels for secure, high-performance, low-energy footprint
applications across various hypervisor and embedded platforms. It is available as an
open-source project created and maintained by the [[https://github.com/orgs/mirage/teams/core/members][MirageOS Core
Team]]. A unikernel can be customised based on the target
architecture by picking the relevant MirageOS libraries and compiling them into a standalone operating system, which
contains strictly the functionality necessary for the target. This minimises the unikernel’s footprint, increasing
the security of the deployed operating system.

The MirageOS architecture can be divided into operating system libraries, typed signatures, and a metaprogramming
compiler. The operating system libraries implement various functionalities, ranging
from low-level network card drivers, to full reimplementations of the TLS protocol, as well as the Git protocol to
store versioned data. A set of typed signatures ensures that the OS libraries are consistent
and work well in conjunction with each other. Most importantly, MirageOS is also a metaprogramming compiler that can
input OCaml source code along with its dependencies, and a deployment target
description in order to generate an executable unikernel, i.e., a specialised binary artefact containing only the
code needed to run on the target platform. Overall, MirageOS focuses on providing a small, well-defined, typed
interface with the system components of the target architecture.

** Anil Madhavapeddy then added


For those curious about what some of the MirageOS libraries _are_, there is a raw Yaml list over at
[[https://github.com/mirage/mirage-repositories/blob/main/repos.yml][mirage/mirage-repositories]] listing most of them.
Conversion of this Yaml to HTML for the main mirage.io website would be a welcome contribution! :slight_smile:

** octachron announced


The OCaml team has the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Alexander Grothendieck by
announcing the release of OCaml version 4.14.0.

Some of the highlights in the 4.14.0 release are:

- Integrated support for "go to definitions" in Merlin.
- Standard library: new modules ~In_channel~ and ~Out_channel~,
  many new functions in Seq module, UTF decoding and validation support
  for strings and bytes.
- Runtime optimisation: GC prefetching. Benchmarks show a speedup of around 20%
  in GC-heavy programs.
- Improved error messages in particular for module-level error.
- Deprecated functions and modules in preparation for OCaml 5.
  In particular, the Stream and Genlex modules are now deprecated.
- Type variables can be explicitly introduced in value and variant constructor
  declarations. For instance,
  #+begin_src ocaml
     val fold: ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
     type showable = Show: 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
  #+end_src
  can now be written as
  #+begin_src ocaml
    val fold: 'acc 'elt. ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
    type showable = Show: 'a. 'a * ('a -> string) -> showable
  #+end_src
- Tail-call with up to 64 arguments are now guaranteed to be optimized
  for all architectures.
- Experimental tail modulo cons (TMC) transformation

The full list of changes can be found in the changelog below. (/editor’s note: please follow the archive link for the full changelog/)

Those releases are available as OPAM switches, and as a source download here:

- https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.14.0.tar.gz
- https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.14/ocaml-4.14.0.tar.gz

** Thierry Martinez announced


I am happy to announce the first release of ~ocaml-in-python~: this is a Python package that exposes all OCaml
modules as Python libraries, generating bindings on the fly. This can be seen as a dual of
[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-pyml-bindgen-a-cli-app-to-generate-python-bindings-directly-from-ocaml-value-specifications/8786][~pyml_bindgen~]]:
~pyml_bindgen~ binds Python libraries in OCaml, while ~ocaml-in-python~ binds OCaml modules in Python.

It is available from [[https://github.com/thierry-martinez/ocaml-in-python][GitHub]] or *via* ~opam~: ~opam install
ocaml-in-python~

Requirements: ~OCaml~ >= 4.13, ~Python~ >= 3.7.

Once installed *via* ~opam~, the package should be registered in the Python environment:

- either by registering the package with ~pip~ using the following command (requires Python >=3.8):
  #+begin_src shell
  pip install --editable "`opam var ocaml-in-python:lib`"
  #+end_src
- or by adding the following definition to the environment:
  #+begin_src shell
  export PYTHONPATH="`opam var share`/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
  #+end_src

Then, we can ~import ocaml~ in Python and use OCaml modules:
#+begin_src python
Python 3.10.0 (default, Nov 10 2021, 19:16:14) [GCC 7.5.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ocaml
>>> print(ocaml.List.map((lambda x : x + 1), [1, 2, 3]))
[2;3;4]
#+end_src

We can for instance compile an OCaml module on the fly from Python.
#+begin_src python
>>> m = ocaml.compile('let hello x = Printf.printf "Hello, %s!\n%!" x')
>>> m.hello('world')
Hello, world!
#+end_src

And we can require and use packages /via/ ~findlib~.
#+begin_src python
>>> ocaml.require("parmap")
>>> from ocaml import Parmap
>>> print(Parmap.parmap(
...   (lambda x : x + 1), Parmap.A([1, 2, 3]), ncores=2))
[2;3;4]
#+end_src

Details about the conversions are given in
[[https://github.com/thierry-martinez/ocaml-in-python/blob/main/README.md][~README.md~]].

Happy hacking!
