* Dune 1.11.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-1-11-0/4138/1

** Rudi Grinberg announced


On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce the release of dune 1.11.0. This release contains quite a few new interesting features such as custom dialects: anyone can define their own OCaml based syntax. Is anyone up to revive the revised syntax? :slight_smile: I'd also like to highlight the the re-launch of variants feature in a sounder form, a new ~build-info~ library that queries build information, and that ~dune init~ can initialize an entire project. But of course, by far the most important thing is that the compiler's colours are now back :champagne:

*** 1.11.0 (23/07/2019)

- Don't select all local implementations in ~dune utop~. Instead, let the
  default implementation selection do its job. (#2327, fixes #2323, @TheLortex,
  review by @rgrinberg)

- Check that selected implementations (either by variants or default
  implementations) are indeed implementations. (#2328, @TheLortex, review by
  @rgrinberg)

- Don't reserve the ~Ppx~ toplevel module name for ppx rewriters (#2242, @diml)

- Redesign of the library variant feature according to the #2134 proposal. The
  set of variants is now computed when the virtual library is installed.
  Introducing a new ~external_variant~ stanza. (#2169, fixes #2134, @TheLortex,
  review by @diml)

- Add proper line directives when copying ~.cc~ and ~.cxx~ sources (#2275,
  @rgrinberg)

- Fix error message for missing C++ sources. The ~.cc~ extension was always
  ignored before. (#2275, @rgrinberg)

- Add ~$ dune init project~ subcommand to create project boilerplate according
  to a common template. (#2185, fixes #159, @shonfeder)

- Allow to run inline tests in javascript with nodejs (#2266, @hhugo)

- Build ~ppx.exe~ as compiling host binary. (#2286, fixes #2252, @toots, review
  by @rgrinberg and @diml)

- Add a ~cinaps~ extension and stanza for better integration with the
  [[https://github.com/janestreet/cinaps][cinaps tool]] tool (#2269,
  @diml)

- Allow to embed build info in executables such as version and list
  and version of statically linked libraries (#2224, @diml)

- Set version in ~META~ and ~dune-package~ files to the one read from
  the vcs when no other version is available (#2224, @diml)

- Add a variable ~%{target}~ to be used in situations where the context
  requires at most one word, so ~%{targets}~ can be confusing; stdout
  redirections and "-o" arguments of various tools are the main use
  case; also, introduce a separate field ~target~ that must be used
  instead of ~targets~ in those situations.  (#2341, @aalekseyev)

- Fix dependency graph of wrapped_compat modules. Previously, the dependency on
  the user written entry module was omitted. (#2305, @rgrinberg)

- Allow to promote executables built with an ~executable~ stanza
  (#2379, @diml)

- When instantiating an implementation with a variant, make sure it matches
  virtual library's list of known implementations. (#2361, fixes #2322,
  @TheLortex, review by @rgrinberg)

- Add a variable ~%{ignoring_promoted_rules}~ that is ~true~ when
  ~--ingore-promoted-rules~ is passed on the command line and false
  otherwise (#2382, @diml)

- Fix a bug in ~future_syntax~ where the characters ~@~ and ~&~ were
  not distinguished in the names of binding operators (~let@~ was the
  same as ~let&~) (#2376, @aalekseyev, @diml)

- Workspaces with non unique project names are now supported. (#2377, fix #2325,
  @rgrinberg)

- Improve opam generation to include the ~dune~ dependencies with the minimum
  constraint set based on the dune language version specified in the
  ~dune-project~ file. (2383, @avsm)

- The order of fields in the generated opam file now follows order preferred in
  opam-lib. (@avsm, #2380)

- Fix coloring of error messages from the compiler (@diml, #2384)

- Add warning ~66~ to default set of warnings starting for dune projects with
  language verison >= ~1.11~ (@rgrinberg, @diml, fixes #2299)

- Add (dialect ...) stanza
  (@nojb, #2404)

- Add a ~--context~ argument to ~dune install/uninstall~ (@diml, #2412)

- Do not warn about merlin files pre 1.9. This warning can only be disabled in
  1.9 (#2421, fixes #2399, @emillon)

- Add a new ~inline_tests~ field in the env stanza to control inline_tests
  framework with a variable (#2313, @mlasson, original idea by @diml, review
  by @rgrinberg).

- New binary kind ~js~ for executables in order to explicitly enable Javascript
  targets, and a switch ~(explicit_js_mode)~ to require this mode in order to
  declare JS targets corresponding to executables. (#1941, @nojb)
      



* OCaml 4.08.1+rc2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2019-07/msg00038.html

** Florian Angeletti announced


The release of OCaml version 4.08.1 is almost here, we have created
a second release candidate that you can test.

This new release candidate combines the rc1 fix for compilation failures
in presence of "-pack" reported by Fabian @copy (breaking nocrypto),
with a new fix for dynlinking failures in bytecode mode reported
by Andre Maroneze (breaking Frama-C).

The source code is available at these addresses:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.08.1+rc2.tar.gz \\
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.08/ocaml-4.08.1+rc2.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands:

#+begin_example
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.1+rc2 --repositories=default,ocaml-beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.1+rc2+<VARIANT> --repositories=default,ocaml-beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_example

where you replace <VARIANT> with one of these:
- afl
- default-unsafe-string
- force-safe-string
- flambda
- fp
- fp+flambda

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Happy hacking, Florian Angeletti, for the OCaml team.

*** OCaml 4.08.1 rc2:

**** Bug fixes:

- #7887: ensure frame table is 8-aligned on ARM64 and PPC64
   (Xavier Leroy, report by Mark Hayden, review by Mark Shinwell
    and Gabriel Scherer)

- #8751: fix bug that could result in misaligned data section when compiling to
   native-code on amd64.  (observed with the mingw64 compiler)
   (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by David Allsopp)

- #8769, #8770: Fix assertion failure with -pack
   (Leo White, review by Gabriel Scherer, report by Fabian @copy)

- #8816, #8818: fix loading of packed modules with Dynlink (regression in #2176).
   (Leo White, report by Andre Maroneze, review by Gabriel Scherer)
      



* Down 0.0.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-down-0-0-1/4140/1

** Daniel Bünzli announced


It's my pleasure to announce the first release of Down:

#+begin_quote
Down is an unintrusive user experience upgrade for the ocaml toplevel (REPL).

Simply load the zero dependency Down library in the ~ocaml~ toplevel and you get line edition, history, session support and identifier completion and documentation (courtesy of ocp-index).

Add this to your ~~/.ocamlinit~:

     #use "down.top"

Down is distributed under the ISC license.
#+end_quote

Down has no library dependency hence it should be easy to get installed and working in more constrained environments. In particular it works with ~ocamlnat~.

Down is also toplevel environmentally friendly: it just adds the ~Down~ module to your scope and installs a ~SIGWINCH~ signal handler.

The Down manual can be consulted [[https://erratique.ch/software/down/doc/manual.html][here]] and is available to you locally via ~odig doc down~.

Homepage: https://erratique.ch/software/down \\
Installation: ~opam install down~
      



* OpenAPI Generator now supports OCaml client generator

** William Cheng announced


We've added the OCaml client generator to the OpenAPI Generator project. To generate an OCaml client given an OpenAPI/Swagger specification file, please follow 3 simple steps below:

1. Download the Java JAR https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.1.0-SNAPSHOT/openapi-generator-cli-4.1.0-20190729.024538-72.jar
2. Rename the JAR as "openapi-generator-cli.jar"
3. Run the following command to generate an OCaml API client for the Petstore API:

Mac/Linux:

#+begin_example
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g ocaml -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml -o /var/tmp/ocaml
#+end_example

Windows:

#+begin_example
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g ocaml -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml -o C:\tmp\ocaml
#+end_example

If you've any feedback or question, please let us know by opening an issue in the Github repo.

Thanks Christophe Gensoul for contributing the new generator (https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/3446).
      



* findlib-1.8.1

* first release of nice_parser
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-nice-parser/4175/1

** Steffen Smolka announced


I’m pleased to announce the first release of [[https://github.com/smolkaj/ocaml-parsing][nice_parser]], a single functor library that wraps your {menhir, ocamlyacc}-generated parser with a nice, high-level interface with beautiful loaction-aware error messages:
#+begin_src ocaml
opam install nice_parser
ocaml
#use "topfind";;
#require “nice_parser”;;
#show_module Nice_parser.Make;;
module Make :
  functor (P : Nice_parser.RAW_PARSER) ->
    sig
      type token = P.token
      type result = P.result
      exception LexError of { msg : string; loc : Location.t; }
      exception ParseError of { token : token; loc : Location.t; }
      val pp_exceptions : unit -> unit
      val parse_string : ?pos:Lexing.position -> string -> result
      val parse_chan : ?pos:Lexing.position -> in_channel -> result
      val parse_file : string -> result
    end
#+end_src

The library relies on OCaml 4.08's new [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2096][source highlighting mechanism]] for pretty lexing and parsing errors,
#+begin_example
File "examples/illegal.katbb", line 1, characters 10-17:
1 | this!; is illegal!; isntit?
              ^^^^^^^
Error: [parser] unexpected token
#+end_example
but can also be used with earlier versions of OCaml.

The [[https://github.com/smolkaj/ocaml-parsing/][nice_parser repository]] includes an example that helps you get started with your own parser in seconds. The API is documented [[https://smolka.st/ocaml-parsing/nice_parser/index.html][here]].

Happy parsing!
