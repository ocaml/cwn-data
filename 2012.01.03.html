&gt; I played with the toplevel a bit, but was frustrated by the limitation
&gt; of one-liner input.
&gt; Even in an interactive toplevel it is nice, I think, to be able to
&gt; write multiline programs.

I uploaded a new version a few minutes ago. Now, you can use "multiline
true" to tell the toplevel that you will use ;; as an end of input
instead of the newline (and "multiline false;;" to switch back). My
patch is inspired from yours, but with minimal changes to the current code.

It works for me, but I would be happy to get feed back from "multi-line
users".

&gt; there was recently a security alert for web services that use hash
&gt; tables to store web form parameters sent via POST (so that millions of
&gt; such parameters can be sent in a single request). It is possible to keep
&gt; the web service busy for hours with such a DoS (denial of service)
&gt; attack. The type of attack boils down to a problem in most hash table
&gt; implementations, namely that the hash functions are invertible, and it
&gt; is possible for a malicious user to construct lots of keys that all map
&gt; to the same bucket of the hash table, creating a mass collision.
&gt; 
&gt; The text of the alert: 
&gt; <a href="http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf">http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to discuss this issue, because it is not restricted to the
&gt; processing of web requests, but may also occur for all other data coming
&gt; from untrusted sources. The web is only the most exposed area where this
&gt; issue exists.
&gt; 
&gt; So how is Ocaml affected? The hash functions used in recent Ocaml
&gt; releases are also insecure in the above mentioned sense (currently
&gt; MurmurHash3, and even a simpler hash function in previous releases). A
&gt; quick survey of the Internet revealed at least one site that tries to
&gt; break it. Probably a good cryptographer could do it in minutes. 
&gt; 
&gt; A pure Hashtbl.add of the constructed keys does not yet lead to the
&gt; performance degradation, but a Hashtbl.replace, and of course
&gt; Hashtbl.find after the table is built up will. So it depends very much
&gt; of the details of the programs whether they are affected or not.
&gt; 
&gt; I've just checked that Ocamlnet uses only Hashtbl.add to collect POST
&gt; parameters, so it is not directly vulnerable. But if the crafted request
&gt; is actually served by a handler, the handler would get a degraded table,
&gt; and could show in turn bad performance (again leading to DoS).
&gt; 
&gt; What are possible fixes?
&gt;
&gt; 1) Avoid hash tables in contexts where security is relevant. The
&gt; alternative is Set (actually a balanced binary tree), which does not
&gt; show this problem.

Highly recommended.  Nothing beats guaranteed O(log n) operations.

&gt; 2) Use cryptographically secure hash functions.

Hopeless: with a hash size of 30 bits, as in Caml, or even 64 bits,
there are no cryptographically secure hash functions.

&gt; 3) Use "randomized" hash tables. The trick here is that there is not a
&gt; single hash function h anymore, but a family h(1)...h(n). When the hash
&gt; table is created, one of the functions is picked randomly. This makes it
&gt; impossible to craft an attack request, because you cannot predict the
&gt; function. 

Indeed.  The optional "seed" parameter to Hashtbl.create does exactly
this in the new implementation of Hashtbl (the one based on Murmur3).

&gt; So, the question is how to do 3). I see two problems here:
&gt; 
&gt; a) how to define the family of hash functions. Is it e.g. sufficient to
&gt; introduce an initialization vector for the Murmurhash algorithm, and
&gt; fill it randomly?

IIRC, the Web pages for the Murmur family of hashes gives some
statistical evidence that this approach works.

&gt; How to get a random number that is good enough?

Hmm.  /dev/random is your friend on the platforms that support it.
Otherwise, there's always the Random module, but Random.self_init
isn't very strong.

&gt; Indeed.  The optional "seed" parameter to Hashtbl.create does exactly

I see. It will be available in 3.13:

val create : ?seed:int -&gt; int -&gt; ('a, 'b) t

There is also an additional functorized interface where this seed
argument exists (Hashtbl.MakeSeeded), and the hash functions seeded_hash
and seeded_hash_param. Well done!

Nevertheless, as we all don't know when 3.13 is ready, I'll have to find
a temporary fix for Ocamlnet. Maybe just a limit for the number of POST
parameters.

Well, /dev/(u)random covers most Unix platforms nowadays. If you are
interested, I have a wrapper for Win32:

<a href="https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netsys/netsys_c_win32.c">https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netsys/netsys_c_win32.c</a>

Scroll down until netsys_fill_random.

&gt; It may be worth noting that Perl solved this problem (back in 2003) by
&gt; unconditionally using a seed which is a global set to a random number
&gt; during interpreter initialization.  

That's how my initial reimplementation of Hashtbl worked, using the
Random module to produce seeds, but I was told (correctly) that in
security-sensitive applications it's better to leave the generation of
random numbers under control of the programmer.  For some applications
Random.self_init might be good enough and for others stronger
randomness is needed.

Of course, you can trivially emulate Perl's behavior using the new
Hashtbl implementation + the Random module.
