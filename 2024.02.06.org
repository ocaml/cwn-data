* OCaml meetups at different places

** Xavier Van de Woestyne announced


In Lille, from 2016 to 2021, we organised LambdaLille:
https://github.com/lambdalille/talks

Even if the event wasn't 100% dedicated to OCaml, it was mainly general. There were several presentations dedicated
to OCaml or by members of the OCaml community (13 talks related to OCaml/Reason).

The event was pretty cool and survived the online meetup pandemic just fine. And yes, we were using Meetup (and
Twitter for communication) with a big presence at other events for publicity. Looking back, I think it was probably
one of the biggest regular events dedicated to functional programming in French, outside the academic world.

In 2021, I moved to Nantes and we were able to launch LambdaNantes :
https://mobilizon.fr/@lambdanantes

(yeah, the logo is ... weird)

The event is, for the moment, less ambitious (but we've already had 2 events dedicated to OCaml, we also sponsored
an OUPS!). Another change is the switch to Mobilizon, a free Meetup implementation based on ActivityPub. It's not
crazy, and as we like to reinvent the wheel, we'll probably write our version in OCaml.

We're always on the lookout for speakers and presentations, so we'd be delighted to host any. If you're close to
Nantes! For 2024, we're going to try, after the ScalaIO 2024 conference (the 10th anniversary, in Nantes, where
I'll be giving the opening keynote) to create a more regular event, and to have better communication so that, why
not, we end up with a real annual conference.

Dear OCamlers,

OCaml.org tutorial updates continue. We've just published the three tutorials on the module system
[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/draft-tutorials-on-modules-functors-and-libraries][announced]] in December:
1. [[https://ocaml.org/modules][Modules]] — Based on the previous version
2. [[https://ocaml.org/functors][Functors]] — Mostly rewritten
3. [[https://ocaml.org/dune][Libraries with Dune]] — New

The target audience is developers learning OCaml. No functional programming knowledge is assumed. However, it comes
after the "Get Started" and "Language" series.

Thanks to @ostera, @yawaramin, @jbe, and @lindig for their feedback. Share yours on GitHub, here, or use the “Open
an Issue” and “Contribute” links at the bottom of the pages. We've recently received and merged many contributions;
we'd be happy to add even more.

Hope it helps

Greetings Cameleers,

Here's a quick heads up about our latest blog post: [[https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2024_01_23_opam_101_the_first_steps/][opam 101: the first
steps]]

We believe this short tutorial could be useful to anybody who is looking into getting acquainted with our beloved
package manager, be they new or simply unaware about how opam interacts with your system at `init` time!

Hoping that it may serve as a reference for all newcomers to the ecosystem,

Kind regards,

** Mateusz Ledwoń announced


Hey everyone, it's me again with more good news from the ~validate~ world!

I'm thrilled to announce that ~validate~ has just leveled up to version 1.1.0! This update packs a bunch of new
features and annotations that I'm sure you'll find useful.

*** What's New:

- *New String Annotations*: ~@ulid~ for ULID strings, ~@ipv4~ and ~@ipv6~ for IP addresses, ~@phone~ for E.164 phone numbers, and ~@mac_address~ for MAC addresses. These will help ensure your data formats are spot on.
- *Option Type Annotations*: Introducing ~@some~ and ~@none~ to assert presence or absence of values in option types.
- *Advanced Annotations*:
  * ~@custom~: Create your own validation logic! It's super flexible and allows you to define validations that suit your unique needs.
  * ~@ignore_if~: Skip validations conditionally. Really handy for those complex data structures.
  * ~@some_if~ and ~@none_if~: Control the requirements of ~Some~ and ~None~ in option types based on conditions.

*** Dive into the Examples:

**** ~@custom~

#+begin_src ocaml
let custom_validator str =
  if String.length str > 1 then Ok ()
  else Error (Validate.BaseError { code = "custom_validator"; params = [] })

type custom_validator_record = {
  custom_validator : string; [@custom custom_validator]
  ...
}
[@@deriving validate]
#+end_src

**** ~@ignore_if~

#+begin_src ocaml
type temperature_record = {
  unit : string;
  temperature : int; [@greater_than_or_equal 0] [@ignore_if fun r -> r.unit <> "K"]
}
[@@deriving validate]
#+end_src

**** ~@some_if~ and ~@none_if~

#+begin_src ocaml
type contact_info = {
  username : string option; [@some_if fun r -> r.email = None]
  email : string option; [@none_if fun r -> Option.is_some r.username]
}
[@@deriving validate]
#+end_src

These new features add so much more depth and flexibility to ~validate~. I'm really excited to see how you all use
them in your projects.

Dear valued OCaml enthusiast,

it is my pleasure to distribute the news that there will be a next face-to-face meeting of MirageOS people in sunny
Marrakesh, Morocco.

This time it is in late April, and we're keen to say hi to new faces and to people we already know.

Everyone is welcome - you should be nice and also be interested in MirageOS (to a certain degree). :D But if you're
mostly joining for the sunshine and delicious food, that is fine as well.

Further information and registration instructions on https://retreat.mirage.io

Hope to see you there!
      



* Fmlib 0.5.8 with unicode parsers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-fmlib-0-5-8-with-unicode-parsers/14003/1

** Helmut announced


I have the pleasure to announce version 0.5.8 of ~fmlib~. ~fmlib~ is a functional monadic library which features
combinator parsing, elm like browser applications, and pretty printing. This release focuses mainly combinator
parsing. The added functionality is:

- Parsing of streams of unicode characters (https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/Fmlib_parse/Ucharacter/index.html)
- Separate parsers and lexers (https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/Fmlib_parse/Parse_with_lexer/index.htm)

Furthermore the library ~Fmlib_browser~ (https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_browser/doc.html) has added
functionality to make parallel http requests (in general parallel tasks).

The main features of ~Fmlib_parse~ are:

- Indentation sensitive parsing: The parsers can parse indentiation sensitive languages like Python, Haskell, Yaml, etc. (https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/parse_indentation.html)
- Incremental parsing: The parsers have inversion of control. I.e. they do not read from streams. The user can push characters or tokens into the parsers. The parsing process can be interrupted and resumed at any time.
- Immutable: The parser can therefore be used in live editors. The parsers can e.g. be stored at the beginning of each line. After editing a line the parser can be restarted by feeding it the current line an following.
- Nicely formatted error messages (https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/parse_format.html)

Hi everyone :wave:

I wrote a short blog post about teaching the fundamentals of Lambda Calculus with some OCaml code:

https://dev.to/chshersh/learn-lambda-calculus-in-10-minutes-with-ocaml-56ba

Nothing really knew if you're already familiar with the subject but it's nice reminder how easy and elegant a
Lambda Calculus code can be in an FP language :slightly_smiling_face:
      



* ppx_minidebug 1.0.0: explore logs of type-annotated let-bindings, code branches

:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppx-minidebug-1-0-0-explore-logs-of-type-annotated-let-bindings-code-branches/14005/1

** Lukasz Stafiniak announced


I'm happy to announce version 1.0 of [[https://github.com/lukstafi/ppx_minidebug][ppx_minidebug]]. It is inspired by
[[https://github.com/dariusf/ppx_debug][dariusf/ppx_debug: Tools for record-and-replay debugging]], but rather than
parsing ~.cmt~ files it relies on user-provided type annotations.

- It can highlight paths to a regular expression-based search term.
- It has options to trim down the size of generated logs and split logs into multiple files.
- It uses [[https://github.com/c-cube/printbox][c-cube/printbox]] as a backend (plus a minimal, flushing backend) -- offering HTML and Markdown output with foldable trees.
- It supports both ~deriving.show~ and ~deriving sexp~ "frontends" -- in the latter case, it can turn large values into foldable trees.
- It can log control flow structures (match / function branches, loops, anonymous functions).
- It propagates types top-down, merges types and decomposes patterns, making it easier to provide types for desired values.

[[https://github.com/lukstafi/ppx_minidebug][ppx_minidebug: Formatted logs of type-annotated let-bound values, function arguments and results, ~if~ and ~match~ branches taken. Optionally, as collapsible HTML or Markdown trees with highlights. (github.com)]]

This month will feature the following talks :

*Correct, Fast LR(1) Unparsing -- François Pottier*

We describe an extension of the LR(1) parser generator Menhir with new
features that aim to facilitate unparsing, that is, transforming abstract syntax trees back into text. Our method
supports non-LR(1) grammars decorated with precedence declarations and guarantees correct unparsing, by which we
mean that parentheses or other disambiguation symbols are inserted where necessary. Furthermore, it allows the user
to control other aspects of the unparsing process, such as layout. Our contributions include a novel view of
unparsing as a composition of several successive transformations; the novel concept of disjunctive concrete syntax
trees (DCSTs); a fast algorithm that converts DCSTs to ordinary concrete syntax trees (CSTs), thereby deciding
where disambiguation symbols must be inserted; and the automated generation of safe APIs for the construction of
DCSTs and deconstruction of CSTs.

*Ocsigen/Be Sport: Implémenter un réseau social en OCaml -- Vincent Balat*

Lancer un réseau social en 2015 est un projet très ambitieux pour une start-up : outre la difficulté de capter une
masse d'utilisateurs suffisante, il faut réussir à implémenter rapidement et avec peu de moyen des applications Web
et mobiles avec un niveau de qualité comparable aux grands réseaux concurrents. Be Sport est le réseau social du
sport, développé en collaboration avec le comité national olympique et plusieurs fédérations. Il recense plus de
650000 équipes françaises dans tous les sports et tous leurs matchs, aux niveaux amateur et professionnel. Il
propose des fonctionnalités similaires à Facebook : pages personnelles, groupes, événements, flux d'actualité, etc.
Dans cet exposé je montrerai comment le choix d'OCaml pour l'implémentation s'est avéré gagnant. L'utilisation
poussée du typage permet de réduire considérablement le temps de débogage et le framework Ocsigen permet de
simplifier beaucoup la communication client-serveur et de développer avec un seul et même code les applications Web
et mobile pour Android et iOS. Je vous donnerai les bases de ce style de programmation précurseur et vous montrerai
comment faire rapidement votre première application.

After the talks there will be some pizzas offered by the [[https://ocaml-sf.org][OCaml Software Foundation]] and
later on we'll move to a pub nearby as usual.
