Christine announced
───────────────────

  The `odoc' team is working to improve [the documentation], so we're
  reaching out to the community to find out these things:
  • Are you using `odoc'? If so, how do you use it? What are your
    thoughts?
  • What parts of the documentation have been helpful?
  • What's missing?
  • What suggestions do you have for improvement?
  • What are you pain points for either/both the documentation or the
    tool itself?

  Your input is more valuable than I can express. Looking forward to
  your answers!

  I have a somewhat related blog post [How to update or install a new
  Linux distribution on WSL].

binsec 0.9.1
════════════

Frédéric Recoules announced
───────────────────────────

  On behalf of the BINSEC team, I am glad to announce that version
  `0.9.1' now lives in `Opam.'

  As a short introduction, BINSEC is an open-source program analyzer
  developed at [CEA List ] to help improve software security at the
  binary level. It has been [successfully applied ] in a number of
  security-related contexts, such as vulnerability finding, (malware)
  deobfuscation, decompilation, formal verification of assembly code or
  even binary-level formal verification.

  The version `0.9' refactors the SMT solver API, enabling new kinds of
  interaction (*incremental solving*) and paving the way to more support
  to internal solver bindings ([bitwuzla], [bitwuzla-cxx], [z3]).

  More information can be found on the [website ], including
  [publications ], [tutorials ] or [contacts], but also the description
  of [this release ] as well as [previous ones].

UDP multicast examples using async and lwt
══════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/blog-udp-multicast-examples-using-async-and-lwt/14678/1>


Foxder announced
────────────────

  I am very new to OCaml and have been enjoying learning the language. I
  was looking for examples of simple UDP multicast senders and receivers
  and could not find any great ones (please let me know if I missed
  some) so I went about creating some [examples] for myself and anyone
  in the future.

  I created examples using both `async' and `lwt' for concurrency. If
  anyone has feedback, I would gladly take it to improve on the
  examples.

opam 2.1.6
══════════

Kate announced
──────────────

  We are pleased to announce the minor release of [opam 2.1.6].

  This opam release consists of backported fixes, of which the main ones
  are:
  • Warn users when `GNU patch' cannot be found. This is required for
    opam-repository maintainers to go forward in implementing
    [ocaml/opam-repository#23789] so that there are as little breakage
    as possible.
  • Improve depexts handling on Gentoo, NetBSD and OpenBSD.

  You’ll find more information in the [release blog post].

  To upgrade simply run:
  ┌────
  │ bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.1.6"
  └────

  or upgrade your distribution of choice if their opam package is
  up-to-date.

Koala announced
───────────────

  Over at lobste.rs there is some discussion on the following blog post:
  <https://hypirion.com/musings/getting-ocaml-through-the-eye-of-a-needle>

  Basically it’s about the ups and downs when using and installing Ocaml
  packages.  Personally, I’ve had similar experiences, but this article
  is really well written. The author shows great technical knowledge and
  I think he tries to be fair.

  What do you think?

  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/launching-the-first-class-windows-project/14687/1>


Sudha Parimala announced
────────────────────────

  I'm excited to introduce the First-Class Windows Project, which aims
  to make OCaml more accessible by enhancing the developer experience on
  Windows to match that of Linux and macOS. Our goal is to create a
  roadmap outlining the steps needed to fully support OCaml on Windows.

  Check our blog post for details:
  <https://tarides.com/blog/2024-05-22-launching-the-first-class-windows-project/>

  As always, happy to receive questions and feedback.

Caper 1.0
═════════

niksu announced
───────────────

  [Caper] has now reached *v1.0*, some 5+ years after development first
  started.

  Caper is a tool for understanding and processing “pcap expressions”
  (also known as /tcpdump filters/) which are used for network packet
  analysis. It is entirely written in OCaml and includes pcap analysis
  logic, a from-scratch BPF compiler, and conversion to/from English
  expressions.

  You can use Caper online through the [BPF Exam] site.

  Caper’s README describes motivation, building, and usage examples, and
  its CHANGELOG describes recent updates.

  A huge thanks goes to Caper’s contributors. Further contributions and
  feedback are welcome – a list of contribution ideas is included on
  Caper’s web page.

Nathan Rebours announced
────────────────────────

  Our next meeting is scheduled on Tuesday May 28th at 6:00PM CET.

  I'll post the google meet link here on the day of the meeting.

  In the meantime, here is the meeting agenda so far:

  • 5.2 Release
    ‣ Released during compiler's beta, went smoothly
  • 5.3 trunk support
    ‣ Reused the work from @hhugo and adapted it
    ‣ We have an open PR with 5.3 support that needs review
    ‣ External contributors already started adding support for new
      features: @nojb added support for the effects patterns and an
      internal change to location reports
    ‣ How to maintain trunk support on our main branch
  • `ppx_deriving' and `ppx_deriving_yojson' ppxlib ports
    ‣ PRs open for the release of both
    ‣ A few bug fixes were required but it should be good to go now
  • 5.2 internal AST bump
    ‣ Now that the 5.2 support has been released, we can discuss the
      plan for this

  If you'd like to bring something else up please answer in this thread
  so we can add it to the agenda.

  You are also welcome to attend the meeting, whether you have something
  to bring to our attention, would like to contribute to the project or
  are just interested in ppxlib and ppx in general.


Tarides GitHub Sponsorship Page – Supporting the OCaml Community Together
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/tarides-github-sponsorship-page-supporting-the-ocaml-community-together/14705/1>


Thomas Gazagnaire announced
───────────────────────────

  I am happy to share that [Tarides] now has a GitHub Sponsorship page,
  live here [https://github.com/sponsors/tarides]! 🎉 As a part of the
  vibrant OCaml community, Tarides is dedicated to supporting both the
  projects and the individuals who make this ecosystem thrive.

  *Why GitHub Sponsorship?*

  The OCaml community is filled with many talented individual
  contributors and collectives who deserve your support, such as
  [Daniel], [Antonio], [Leandro], [Robur] and many others. We encourage
  you to sponsor them directly to support their work.

  But now, you can also sponsor [Tarides]! Creating a GitHub Sponsorship
  page is an important step for us, aimed at sustaining projects that
  currently lack direct, stable revenue sources. While we are thankful
  for long-term sponsors such as Jane Street and Tezos, we want to
  diversify our open-source funding stream to ensure the long-term
  stability and sustainability of core infrastructure projects we are
  working on for the community.

  *What Can You Expect?*

  On our sponsorship page, you’ll find detailed information about our
  ongoing projects, including:

  • *OCaml Compiler*: Maintaining ease of use, correctness, and
     performance of the compiler(s).
  • *OCaml Platform*: Ensuring core tools evolve and are compatible with
     new OCaml releases.
  • *OCaml.org*: Maintaining the central knowledge base for the OCaml
     community.
  • *Advanced Projects*: Such as MirageOS, Irmin and Eio.

  Your support will directly contribute to the sustainability of these
  projects and allow us to continue our work and maintain these
  libraries and tools.

  *How You Can Help*

  We invite you to visit our [GitHub Sponsorship page] to learn more
  about our projects and how you can get involved. We welcome any
  suggestions or comments on how we can improve and better serve the
  community.

  *Commercial Support*

  While this annoucement is about the ongoing maintenance of our core
  open-source projects, we are also available to organize training,
  develop custom extensions, or provide long-term commercial support for
  these projects. [Get in touch](<mailto:contact@tarides.com>) for more
  details.

  Thank for your support, Thomas, on behalf of the Tarides Team
