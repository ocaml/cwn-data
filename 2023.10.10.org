* bindings to the PARI algebra library
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-bindings-to-the-pari-algebra-library/13157/1

** Julien announced


I wrote [[https://github.com/jtcoolen/ocaml-pari][ocaml-pari]], an OCaml library providing bindings to the
[[https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/][PARI]] algebra library. The bindings are automatically generated from the library’s
header files. In addition, a light wrapper offers a thin layer of static typing to not only encode part of the written
documentation into types by means of phantom types, but to encode actual invariants to prevent mismatches between
functions and arguments. E.g., to prevent from multiplying a group element by a polynomial. One can find code samples
in the ~examples~ directory, notably cryptographic polynomial commitments (~kzg.ml~) and an attack on a knapsack
cryptosystem (~knapsack_lll.ml~).

The underlying library, PARI, is written in C and relies on a single recursive type to represent all objects. With the
wrapper, this type is ~(‘kind, ‘structure) t~ so as to annotate it with its kind and the operations it supports. It is
thus possible to write a generic algorithm that works with group elements ~(‘a, group) t~ for instance. The library
will be available on OPAM once its cache is synchronized (so tomorrow): ~opam install ocaml-pari~.

** gasche announced


We compiler maintainers were recently approached by students looking for a contribution to the OCaml compiler that
would be appropriate for their final year project. We thought of a couple contribution topics, but in the end the
students decided to work on something else. I turned our project ideas into github/ocaml issues; if you were looking
for a medium-size project to contribute to the OCaml compiler codebase, you may be interested in some of them.

- small task: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12629
- medium-sized task: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12630
- medium-sized task: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12631
- larger task: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12632
- choose-the-size task: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12633

Let me use this occasion to remind people that we have tagged some issues as "newcomer jobs", which may be good entry
point to contribute to the compiler.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/labels/newcomer-job][newcomer jobs]] for relatively easy tasks
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/labels/newcomer-job-advanced][advanced newcomer jobs]] for harder tasks (more work, or requires good expertise in the language or learning technical aspects of how the compiler works)

Please feel free of course to ask any question, make suggestions etc.
      



* Ppxlib 0.31.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppxlib-0-31-0/13170/1

** Sonja Heinze announced


We're happy to announce the release of ~Ppxlib~ 0.31.0.

This ~Ppxlib~ release fixes a bug in the support of OCaml 5.1.0. Before that bug fix, the warnings about a
generative/applicative mismatch between a functor creation and its application introduced by OCaml 5.1.0 were also
triggered when that mismatch didn't exist.

Furthermore, the release contains a couple of bug fixes in the context of attributes.

We're also excited about two main enhancements. One allows authors of extension node rewriters to add a path argument
to the extension node. That's excellent for hygiene since it allows the PPX to be explicit about modules rather than
depending on its scope.

The other main enhancement allows an opt-in for compiler warnings about unused code generated by derivers (warnings
w32 and w60). That opting in needs to happen on both sides of the deriver, the writer side and the user side. Opting
in to those code warnings will help to clean up unused code, leading to performance improvements in compilation and
editor support.

- Fix support for OCaml 5.1: migrated code preserves generative functor warnings, without creating more. Locations are better preserved. (#432, @pitag-ha, @panglesd)
- Driver: Add ~-unused-code-warnings~ command-line flag. (#444, @ceastlund)
- Add ~?warning~ flag to ~Deriving.Generator.make~. (#440, @jacksonzou123 via @ceastlund)
- Restore the "path_arg" functionality in the V3 API (#431, @ELLIOTTCABLE)
- Expose migration/copying/etc. functions for all AST types needed by ~Pprintast~ (#454, @antalsz)
- Preserve quoted attributes on antiquotes in metaquot (#441, @ncik-roberts)
- Attribute namespaces: Fix semantics of reserving multi-component namespaces (#443, @ncik-roberts)

* dune 3.11.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-11-0/13173/1

** Etienne Millon announced


The Dune team is pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.11 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x#Windows_for_Workgroups_3.11]["for
workgroups"]].

Here is the changelog:

*** Added

- ~enabled_if~ now supports ~arch_sixtyfour~ variable (#8023, fixes #7997,
  @Alizter)
- Experimental: Added a ~$ dune monitor~ command that can connect to a running
  ~dune build~ in watch mode and display the errors and progress. (#8152,
  @Alizter)
- The ~progress~ RPC procedure now has an extra field for the ~In_progress~
  constructor for the number of failed jobs. (#8212, @Alizter)
- Add a ~--preview~ flag to ~dune fmt~ which causes it to print out the changes
  it would make without applying them (#8289, @gridbugs)
- Introduce ~(source_trees ..)~ to the install stanza to allow installing
  entire source trees. (#8349, @rgrinberg)
- Add ~--stop-on-first-error~ option to ~dune build~ which will terminate the
  build when the first error is encountered. (#8400, @pmwhite and @Alizter)
- Dune now displays the number of errors when waiting for changes in watch
  mode. (#8408, fixes #6889, @Alizter)
- Add ~with_prefix~ keyword for changing the prefix of the destination of
  installed files matched by globs. (#8416, @gridbugs)
- Added experimental ~--display tui~ option for Dune that opens an interactive
  Terminal User Interface (TUI) when Dune is running. Press '?' to open up a
  help screen when running for more information. (#8429, @Alizter and
  @rgrinberg)
- Add a ~warnings~ field to ~dune-project~ files as a unified mechanism to
  enable or disable dune warnings (@rgrinberg, 8448)
- ~dune exec~: support syntax like ~%{bin:program}~. This can appear anywhere
  in the command line, so things like ~dune exec time %{bin:program}~ now work.
  (#6035, #8474, fixes #2691, @emillon, @Leonidas-from-XIV)
- Add a new alias ~@doc-json~ to build odoc documentation in JSON format. This
  output can be consumed by external tools. (#8178, @emillon)

*** Changed and fixed

- Use ~posix_spawn~ instead of ~fork~ on MacOS. This gives us a performance
  boost and allows us to re-enable thread. (#8090, @rgrinberg)
- Modules that were declared in ~(modules_without_implementation)~,
  ~(private_modules)~ or ~(virtual_modules)~ but not declared in ~(modules)~
  will raise an error. (#7674, @Alizter)
- No longer emit linkopts(javascript) in META files (#8168, @hhugo)
- RPC message styles are now serialised meaning that RPC diagnostics keep their
  Ansi styling. (#8516, fixes #6921, @Alizter)
- Truncate output from actions that produce too much output (@tov, #8351)
- Allow libraries to shadow OCaml builtin libraries. Previously, builtin
  libraries would always take precedence. (@rgrinberg, #8558)
- ~dune utop~ no longer links ~utop~ in "custom" mode, which should make this
  command considerably faster. (#8631, fixes #6894, @nojb)
- Ensure that package names in ~dune-project~ are valid opam package names.
  (#8331, @emillon)
- init: check that module names are valid (#8644, fixes #8252, @emillon)
- dune init: parse ~--public~ as a public name (#8603, fixes #7108, @emillon)
- Stop signing source files with substitutions. Sign only binaries instead
  (#8361, fixes #8360, @anmonteiro)
- Make copy sandbox support directory targets. (#8705, fixes #7724, @emillon)

*** Deprecated and removed

- Deprecate install destination paths beginning with ".." to prevent packages
  escaping their designated installation directories. (#8350, @gridbugs)
- Remove warning against ~.dune~ files generated by pre dune 2.0 (#8611,
  @rgrinberg)
- Remove versions 0.1 and 0.2 of the experimental ctypes extension. (#8293,
  @emillon)
      



* Arrakis: A new RISC-V simulator
:PROPERTIES:

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/arrakis-a-new-risc-v-simulator/13176/1

** Valoran announced


I've been working with a friend on a new RISC-V simulator called Arrakis, and we just did our first release!

Most of the features are listed in the [[https://gitlab.com/valoranM/arrakis][README]], but if you are interested, here
is a quick summary:
- Full RV32IM Instruction set
- Different type of environmental call support (UNIX and Venus)
- Partial GNU ~as~ assembler directive
- A debugging system using breakpoint

There is currently only a terminal interface, but we have already implemented a UNIX socket to make it easy to develop
plugin to integrate it to other development environment (We are currently working on a Vim plugin)

As it is our first release, they may still be some issue, but the simulator is already quite usable.

The complete documentation for the project is available [[https://gitlab.com/valoranM/arrakis/-/wikis/home][here]]

We would be more than happy to receive any feedback, so please feel free to test it and open an issue if you find
something!
      



* Web Analytics on OCaml.org
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/web-analytics-on-ocaml-org/13188/1

** Thibaut Mattio said, starting a discussion


As you've witnessed, the OCaml.org team has been hard at work to make the site the best resource to learn OCaml and
discover the ecosystem.

Since the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/v3-ocaml-org-we-are-live/9747][launch of V3]] in April last year, we've revamped
the centralised documentation site based on community feedback, and we're currently doing the same for the Learn area
and the documentation. We're planning to revisit the Blog and Community sections next.

While we're receiving tons of qualitative feedback that indicates that we're moving in the right direction, it's been
a challenge to measure the impact of the decisions we take. Are users of the site able to find the Standard Library
documentation more easily? How many users who install OCaml end up reading the documentation? Are people using the new
[[https://ocaml.org/changelog][OCaml Changelog]] and the [[https://ocaml.org/jobs][Job board]]? A lot of questions are
currently difficult to answer and would allow us to make better decisions to improve the experience on the site.

When we launched the site, we made a strong commitment to [[https://ocaml.org/policies/privacy-policy][protect users'
privacy]]. We refuse to use cookies, we are not using any external service
that might collect your data, we're vendoring every JavaScript and asset so as to not use external CDN, and we're not
running any web analytics.

We're still unwaveringly committed to protecting OCaml.org's visitors' privacy. To address our lack of data on the
site's usage while respecting the principles we've adopted, we've selected [[https://plausible.io/][Plausible]] as a
possible way to get usage statistics.

Plausible is a [[https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics][privacy-focused]] web analytics service. It doesn't
use cookies, doesn't collect any personal data, and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.

We plan on rolling out Plausible for OCaml.org in the coming weeks.

Do you have any questions or concerns with using Plausible on OCaml.org?
      



* A Roadmap for the OCaml Platform - Seeking Your Feedback

** Deep in this thread, Xavier Leroy said and Anil Madhavapeddy replied


#+begin_quote
I agree that an integrated tool can have better performance than a collection of standalone tools used via their CLIs.
But this is not a valid reason to kill the standalone tools and their CLIs! It’s for end-users to choose between the
fast integrated tool with its fixed workflow and the perhaps slower but more flexible standalone tools that support
the users’ preferred workflow.
#+end_quote

I fear I may be partly responsible for the 'killing the CLI' part of this, as I first demonstrated a really early
integrated prototype back in a [[https://watch.ocaml.org/w/83ANjgugXRtJ7ACNRapsQe?start=27m3s][Oxford OCaml Workshop
presentation]]. Allow me to be really clear on my
position here today: *any CLI that is released as part of OCaml Platform tooling and has users is one we try really
hard to maintain*, as that CLI is very often already integrated into build scripts (and will thus break some opam
packages that are already released, and we do try so hard to keep those building over time without upper bounds).

Back when I started prototyping the integrated CLI in 2017, OCaml was possibly at its lowest point in terms of the
Platform tooling, since almost no industrial users actually used the publicly released tools!  Jane Street had Jenga,
Coq had Makefiles, Xen still used omake, the OCaml compiler itself had backed away from using ocamlbuild, and every
project I talked to didn't because they cited slow performance and difficult debuggability to the then-recommended
stack of Oasis/ocamlbuild/ocamlfind.  How did this happen? A fateful decision back in 2012 resulted in Oasis
_wrapping_ the ocamlbuild CLI, which in turn had a special mode that wrapped ocamlfind, and every single compiler
invocation went through 5 forks before it ever got to ~ocamlopt.opt~.  If instead Oasis had instead linked to
ocamlbuild as a library, we may have avoided this, but we'll never find out. And I'm not criticising the authors of
Oasis for their decision either -- it was a very pragmatic one to get us past having to write direct ocamlbuild _tags
files.

What I underestimated with the integrated CLI is the sheer amount of time any migrations take for downstream projects,
and also what Xavier points out above about multi-language builds and the flexibility of Makefiles.  So my own
thinking has evolved on it too: what we need from our tools is a OCaml library interface, with the CLIs being as thin
as possible. And by and large, that's mostly how the active tools in the Platform operate today.  We have a number of
CLI tools that interoperate via opam-libs or the more lightweight opam-file-format.  Dune itself is just vendoring in
big chunks of opam for its own integration, which means that it can be upgraded with the same core logic as used in
future versions of the opam CLI.  Dune's also got a library reimplementation of ocamlfind, so that it doesn't need to
shell out to that but still retains strong compatibility.

This also points to a possible good toplevel metric for the OCaml Platform: *what proportion of the community are
using the tools that we recommend?*  This proportion is clearly increasing (opam, dune, merlin, lsp-server and odoc
are now widely adopted both in open source and in monolithic codebases that use OCaml), but I think we're less clear
on others like ocamlformat, dune-release _vs_ opam-publish, and mdx. Suggestions for improvements on this metric, and
for ways to measure it more systematically, are welcome.

** Trent Small announced


Hi everyone!

I'm pleased to announce a new release of ~producer~, v0.2.0.

This release allows a Producer graph to be specified for Monads with more than one type parameter (e.g. ~Result.t~).
The previous release of this library only allowed Monads with one type parameter (e.g. ~Lwt.t~).

Feel free to take a look and let me know what you think -- contributions are also welcome if you find this idea
intriguing and want to improve upon it.

Happy coding!
