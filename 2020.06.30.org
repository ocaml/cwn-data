* finch - static site generator

** roddy announced


Announcing [[https://github.com/roddyyaga/finch][finch]], a simple static site generator. It uses content written as
Markdown plus YAML frontmatter like Jekyll/Hugo etc. and produces output with
[[https://github.com/tategakibunko/jingoo][Jingoo]] templates. It also has some integrations with React (as in the JS
library) in the form of Jingoo filters: the motivation behind it was to make it easier to develop sites that use
React just for some in some parts rather than structuring the whole site as a single page application.

** RaphaÃ«l Proust announced


Version 0.5 of ~ringo~ and ~ringo-lwt~ are now available in ~opam~. Although this version changes ~ringo-lwt~ only, both packages are released anew to keep the version numbers in sync. This version includes:

- Improvement in documentation.
- Simplifications and reduction in the memory footprint of lwt-wrapped caches.
- Fix for a race condition in the automatic cleanup (previously, on weak caches only, a promise being rejected could cause a different promise to be removed from the cache)
- Fix a leak
- More test, including a test for leakiness.

** octachron announced


The release of OCaml 4.11.0 is approaching.

After three alpha releases, we have created a first beta version to help you
adapt your software to the new features ahead of the release.

The compatibility of the opam ecosystem with OCaml 4.11.0 is currently quite
good, and it should be possible to test this beta without too much trouble.

The source code is available at these addresses:

 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0+beta1.tar.gz \\
 https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.11/ocaml-4.11.0+beta1.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands.
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+beta1+VARIANT --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
 where you replace VARIANT with one of these: afl, flambda, fp, fp+flambda

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

If you are interested by the list of new features, and the on-going list of bug fixes the
updated change log for OCaml 4.11.0 is available at:

* FlexDLL 0.38 released

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/flexdll-0-38-released/6043/1

** David Allsopp announced


We are pleased to announce the release of FlexDLL 0.38!

FlexDLL provides a dlopen-like interface for Windows and is used to simplify the linking process for the native
Windows ports of OCaml and to allow dynamic loading of C code (bytecode stub libraries and native Dynlink). It is
also used for the same purpose in the Cygwin ports of OCaml, except that they can be configured without shared
library support.

The release includes various bugfixes as well as proper support for C++ linking on mingw and linking against data
symbols in import libraries.

Please see the [[https://github.com/alainfrisch/flexdll/releases/tag/0.38][release page]] for more information.
