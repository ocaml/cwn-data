1) New releases of Gmetadom, gdome2-xslt and lablgtkmathview
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Claudio Sacerdoti Coen announced:

I am happy to announce the latest versions of the following libraries:

 * gmetadom 0.1.6:
    A binding to gdome2, the GNU DOM Level 2 implementation.
    The Core and Mutation Events modules are implemented and 100% compatible
    with the W3C Reccomendations. The binding is type-safe thanks to an
    extensive usage of the phantom types technique.

    URL: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmetadom/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmetadom/</a>

 * gdome2-xslt 0.0.4-4:
   A C and OCaml library to apply XSLT stylesheets to gdome2 documents.
   This is a binding to libxslt, one of the fastest XSLT processors out
   there. You can apply your own stylesheets to any gdome2 document and
   obtain a brand new gdome2 documents.

   URL: <a href="http://helm.cs.unibo.it/software/gdome_xslt/">http://helm.cs.unibo.it/software/gdome_xslt/</a>

 *  lablgtkmathview 0.4.1:
    A lablgtk binding to GtkMathView, a Gtk widget to render MathML 2.0
    documents. With this widget you get high quality rendering of
    mathematical formulae and very good interaction possibilites:
    the widget renders a gdome2 DOM tree and react to its modifications;
    you change the tree, and the rendering is changed accordingly on-the-fly.

    Changes: the binding is now in synch with the 0.4.1 version of
             GtkMathView, the first one with editing support.

2) CPS folds
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Neel Krishnaswami lectured:

You are 90% of the way to figuring out how to use CPS in this
situation, actually! The trick is to use continuation functions to
represent the computation yet to be done. I'll illustrate with
an example -- let's take a tree type:

type 'a tree =
  | Leaf
  | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree

Now, let's write a regular, recursive fold for this datatype:

let rec fold ~leaf ~node tree =
  match tree with
  | Leaf -&gt; leaf
  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      let v1 = fold ~leaf ~node left in
      let v2 = fold ~leaf ~node right in
      node v1 x v2

val fold : leaf:'a -&gt; node:('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'b tree -&gt; 'a

As you expect, this particular fold exhibits non-constant
stack growth, because there are function calls that aren't in
tail position:

  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      let v1 = fold ~leaf ~node left in   (* Not a tail-call *)
      let v2 = fold ~leaf ~node right in  (* Not a tail-call *)
      node v1 x v2

What we want to do is to make all of the recursive calls to fold
tail-recursive, so that they don't grow the stack. Let's be
stupid simple for a second, and throw away all of things keeping that
from happening:

let rec tr_fold ~leaf ~node tree =
  match tree with
  | Leaf -&gt; leaf
  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      tr_fold ~leaf ~node left

Now tr_fold is tail-recursive, at the cost of forgetting how to
call itself on the right subtree and applying the node function.
Let's fix that by adding a new parameter to tr_fold that will
keep track of that -- and the value that tracks "stuff to execute"
is a function:

let rec tr_fold' ~leaf ~node tree k =
  match tree with
  | Leaf -&gt; k leaf  (* Call leaf to "stuff to execute" *)
  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      tr_fold' ~leaf ~node left  (* Now a tail-call! *)
        (fun v1 -&gt;
          let v2 = tr_fold' ~leaf ~node right k in (* Not a tail-call *)
          node v1 x v2)

tr_fold' :
  leaf:'a -&gt; node:('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'c -&gt; 'c) -&gt; 'b tree -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'c) -&gt; 'c

Now we just need to repeat the exercise on the second let body,
and we get:

let rec kfold ~leaf ~node tree k =
  match tree with
  | Leaf -&gt; k leaf
  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      kfold ~leaf ~node left
        (fun v1 -&gt;
          kfold ~leaf ~node right
            (fun v2 -&gt; k (node v1 x v2)))

val kfold :
  leaf:'a -&gt; node:('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'b tree -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'c) -&gt; 'c

At this point, kfold has no stack growth in it, because every
self-call it makes is a tail call. All of the control context is
stored in the closures -- the continuations -- we have build during
its execution. You can see the close correspondence between the
original and the CPS version by playing a few games with formatting:

  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      let v1 = fold ~leaf ~node left in
      let v2 = fold ~leaf ~node right in
      node v1 x v2

vs:

  | Node(left, x, right) -&gt;
      kfold ~leaf ~node left  (fun v1 -&gt;
      kfold ~leaf ~node right (fun v2 -&gt;
        k (node v1 x v2)))

You can see that what we do in each case is "compute the left/right
subtree and then bind the result to v1/v2". Finally, you can get back
the original fold by passing in the identity function as the "starter"
continuation:

let fold ~leaf ~node tree = kfold ~leaf ~node tree (fun x -&gt; x)

val fold : leaf:'a -&gt; node:('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'b tree -&gt; 'a


(As an aside: Yes, I didn't completely CPS-convert the program -- the
node function is not in CPS-form in kfold.)

3) labltk vs lablgtk
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Henri Dubois-Ferriere asked:

I need to write a gui front-end to a caml network simulator of mine.
GUI-wise it should be standard fare (a few buttons, and menu, etc).
The other property is that the GUI communicates with the simulator
over a socket, so I need event-driven I/O to be integrated with GUI event
loop.

My instinct is to go with labltk, "because it's there", and it can handle
file descriptor events pretty easily.

But since I'm going to live with this choice for quite a while, i'm
wondering what are the broad pros/cons between labltk and lablgtk?
does anything stick out as being specific to one or the other?

Thanks to anyone who can reduce my caml-GUI ignorance in any way..

Eric C. Cooper answered:

Very subjectively, I found that labltk was simpler to code, at least
for simple GUIs.  The appearance is fairly clean and attractive
(especially if you override the default fonts), but looks somewhat
out-of-place in a more modern desktop environment.

I found lablgtk more complex to code, but it is more flexible and has
a richer set of ready-made components.  It is very attractive, and 
(obviously) fits in well on a Gnome desktop.

Matt Gushee said:

Let's see ...

* Tk has a limited selection of widgets. From what you said of your
  project, it may well have all you need, but it is lacking a few things
  that people seem to expect to find in "modern" GUI toolkits: spin
  buttons, paned windows, tabbed notebooks, tree displays ...

* Last time I checked (several months ago), GTK was considered to be
  less-than-production-quality on Windows and MacOS, whereas Tk has been
  in use on those platforms for a long time.

* (My impression is that) GTK has good Unicode support. Tk has had issues
  with i18n for some time. The latest versions may be up to par, but I'm
  not sure. Probably either would be fine for Western European
  languages; the problems I have heard of were mostly related to CJKV.

* If you need to use raster graphics, you should be aware that Tk only
  has built-in support for GIF and PBM/PGM/PPM/PNM file formats. I'm not
  sure, but I would assume that GTK supports JPEG, PNG, and other modern
  formats.

Scott added about unicode support:

The new gtk (2) has good unicode support.  I'm not sure how that's
addressed in lablgtk (2).  Tk works with unicode, but labltk does
not.  It is possible to hack labltk to do this, but it's _very_ ugly
(trust me I've done it)

Sven Luther also added:

lablgtk2 does also support SVG graphics now, and the AA fonts are really
worth it.

5) Using zippers to handle huge trees
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons gave a long lecture with some code:

Zippers are a simple way to handle huge (in fact infinite) trees.

1. Explanation of zippers
2. Related work
3. Examples of code

1. Explanation of zippers

Zippers may be seen as 'functional pointers' since they offer :
- purely functional and typed operations
- O(1) acces to the pointed element
- O(1) pointer movements

The restrictions are that only one pointer is allowed by data 
structure and every pointer movement allocates memory.

Take a classical type declaration for binary search trees

type 'a tree = E | N of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree * int

Consider a binary search tree and an inner node to which you want to
point. To have a 0(1) acces to the pointed subtree, it has to be
directly available from the base of the data structure. Then, the
rest of the tree must be kept in a separate place. We will deconstruct
it along the path from the root to the pointed node

type 'a path =
  | Root
  | Left of 'a * 'a tree * 'a path
  | Right of 'a tree * 'a * 'a path

type 'a zipper = 'a tree * 'a path

The zipper contrains as annouced :
- the pointed subtree
- the rest of the tree breaked along the path to the root

Then we define the pointer movements (one for each pointer in the data
structure) :

exception Bottom

(* To be replaced by a balancing constructor *)
let makeDTree = fun l v r -&gt; N (l, v, r, 0)

let move_left = fun (tree, path) -&gt;
  match tree with
    | E -&gt; raise Bottom
    | N (l, v, r, _) -&gt; (l, Left (v, r, path))

let move_right = fun (tree, path) -&gt;
  match tree with
    | E -&gt; raise Bottom
    | N (l, v, r, _) -&gt; (r, Right (l, v, path))

let move_up = fun (tree, path) -&gt;
  match path with
    | Root -&gt; raise Top
    | Left (v, r, tail) -&gt; (makeDTree tree v r, tail)
    | Right (l, v, tail) -&gt; (makeDTree l v tree, tail)

Now we can build an arbitrary large tree by the following procedure :
- build a tree of bounded depth
- choose the node which will be developped next
- move the current pointer to that node
- continue building the tree

This procedure uses a bounded stack space

2. Related work

Zippers were invented by Gérard Huet. There is a paper on the JFP
G. Huet. The Zipper. J. Functional Programming, 7 (5), Sept 1997, pp. 549--554.

He uses n-ary trees and binary trees in his examples. The main
difference is that in binary trees the pointers are not organized in
the same way (his 'left' operation is what in Baire is (left o up))

Ralf Hinze has tried to give a general framework for functional
pointers named a web (you give your data structure and the basic
transformations and the data structure does the rest)

Ralf Hinze and Johan Jeuring. Functional Pearl: Weaving a Web. Journal
of Functional Programming, 11(6):681-689, November 2001.

Available on the net via Hinze's home page.
In my opinion his article is not really convincing and not very clear.

Several libraries already use zippers

- Zen (Gérard Huet, Caml) uses zippers to handle acyclic automata
minimization

- SML/NJ Standard library (John Reppy) uses zippers to handle deletion
in red-black trees

- MetaPRL (Caml) uses zippers to handle insertion and deletion in
splay and red-black trees

- Grammatical Framework (Aarne Ranta, Haskell) uses zippers to
navigate through n-ary trees.

All this code is available on the web.

3. Examples of code

Here are some examples of usual binary search trees operations made
whith zippers (insert, delete, move_pointer_to, ...) extracted from
Baire (current version 11 avril 2003, plenty of bugs and breaked
code, you will find it in Baire's download pages) :

6) searching the caml-list archives

Ker Lutyn said:

I used to be frustrated with the caml-list archive search, until I realized
that I can just use Google to do it. For example:

7) DBI
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Christophe Troestler asked:

A while ago, it was said on this list that a common database interface
(à la Perl DBI) would be nice.  Is there any progress in that
direction?  If dynamic selection of the database is not needed,
agreeing on a minimal API (that must cover all usual needs) is enough.
Otherwise, one must define a basic set of facilities that each basic
database interface (perl DBD) must provide and use dynamic loading to  
a common DBI module.  So, in my opinion, the first thing to do is any
case is

  agree on a general database interface.

Are there people interested on this list?  Personally I don't have
much time to contribute but as I will be soon in need of using DB, I
am willing to make an effort.

Nicolas Cannasse proposed:

Such discussions are difficult to handle on the Caml-list, since there is
only a few people that are interested in the topic. I suggest that we switch
to the ExtLib mailling list , since that interface will obviously be part of
the ExtLib ( this is an OCaml Standard - extended - Library ).

People who are willing to contribute can join the mailling list here :

9) mixing different languages
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fred Yankowski asked and Pierre Weis answered:

&gt; That said, I now try for a strict separation of imperative code and
&gt; HTML code, so that my HTML template files have no language specific
&gt; code and contain only formal parameters and markings of optional and
&gt; repeated blocks of HTML content.  I haven't used OCaml to generate
&gt; HTML pages, but that's the approach I would want there too.

That's precisely the simple idea used in htmlc (see
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/htmlc/eng.htm">http://pauillac.inria.fr/htmlc/eng.htm</a>): the HTML templates are HTML
files with SSI directives and occurrences of variables to be replaced
by their values. Variable values are defined separately in simple
configuration files; environment specific variables can also occur:
their value is then picked up from the environment.

Normally, those HTML templates are statically compiled while updating
the Web site (thus checking for errors in advance, before serving the

If you happen to miss a cwn, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@inria.fr) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/</a>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
