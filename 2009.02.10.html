After 4 years the next stable version of PXP is released. Please have a
look at <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/pxp.html">http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/pxp.html</a> for download
links and the new "PXP Reference" manual.

This release focuses on documentation. The mentioned manual has been
written from scratch, and PXP comes now with ocamldoc-generated HTML
pages.

There are also a few changes in the code (see the README).

GODI packages have been updated.

A lot of fun for the next 4 years,

Gerd

P.S. I've written a bit about this version in

Melt is a set of libraries and tools which allows you to program LaTeX
documents using OCaml. This combines the typesetting power of LaTeX with the
programming power of OCaml. It can be combined with Mlpost to include figures.

If you were at JFLA, it can be seen as my answer to the question "what about
MlTeX" which was asked during the Mlpost presentation.

Melt can be download on OCamlForge:
<a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/melt/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/melt/</a>

This is the first release of Melt. Thus, it might not be considered as truly
stable. However, several documents, including articles and slides, have
already been produced using Melt, so it is definitely usable.

The documentation is included in the distribution (read the README). Some
examples can be found in the "bench" directory (see doc.mlt).

Have fun with Melt! :)

We have just released version 0.6 of mlpost, an ocaml library to
produce nice looking postscript figures with tex-typeset elements.
You can get it at:

<a href="http://mlpost.lri.fr/">http://mlpost.lri.fr/</a>

Here is the changelog:

o - changes in behaviour, new features
* - incompatible changes in the interface

* "open Mlpost" is not added to input files any more -
 users have to add by themselves
* the type Command.figure becomes Command.t
o inclusion of external images (png, jpg etc)
o transformations on boxes
o Box.{grid,gridl,gridi}: new options hpadding, vpadding, stroke, pen
o additional options for many functions
o corrections of some small bugs in box calculations
o A function in the API to scan a TeX file for the prelude

The code is here:

<a href="http://www.annexia.org/tmp/ocaml-mingw-gtk">http://www.annexia.org/tmp/ocaml-mingw-gtk</a>

The README from the tarball is also attached below.

Rich.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This tarball / directory contains an example of cross-compiling OCaml
LablGtk programs for Windows, which I originally demonstrated at the
OCaml Users Conference meeting Feb 2009.

You will need to start here:

 <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/MinGW">http://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/MinGW</a>

It's a good idea to join the Fedora MinGW mailing list (mentioned on
the above page), and if you have any problems post them on the mailing
list.

	 	-   -   -

You must install Fedora 10 which you will need to upgrade to Fedora
Rawhide (the development version):

 <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide</a>

If you don't have Fedora Rawhide already, try installing it in a
virtual machine.

OCaml cross-compilation is _not_ supported on RHEL, EPEL, CentOS,
Fedora &lt;= 10, etc at this time, although we may add these
distributions in future.

The software required is partially in Rawhide and partially in a
separate repository.  Create and edit a file /etc/yum.repos.d/mingw.repo
containing:

 [mingw]
 name=MinGW
 baseurl=<a href="http://www.annexia.org/tmp/mingw/fedora-rawhide/x86_64">http://www.annexia.org/tmp/mingw/fedora-rawhide/x86_64</a>
 enabled=1
 gpgcheck=0

Replace "x86_64" with "i386" if you have a 32 bit machine.  We do not
compile the temporary repository for non-x86 architectures at this
time.

Now install the packages and their deps by typing this command (as
root):

 yum install \
    ocaml ocaml-x11 ocaml-findlib-devel \
    mingw32-gcc \
    mingw32-ocaml mingw32-ocaml-findlib mingw32-ocaml-lablgtk2 \
    mingw32-nsis mingw32-nsiswrapper \
    wine autoconf automake

You should now be able to compile the Windows demo by doing:

 mingw32-configure
 make

and then run/test it in Wine by doing:

 wine gtk_test.exe

To compile the Windows installer you will first need to install the
program (this is an arcane requirement which will be fixed in future).
As root do:

 make install

Then as a normal user do:

 make installer.exe

Copy installer.exe to a Windows machine to try it.

    		   -   -   -

Developers: The only files you need to copy in order to create an
autotools package are 'configure.ac' and 'Makefile.am'.  After copying
these to a new directory, run:

 autoreconf -i

(You may need to create empty files 'README', 'NEWS' etc. as
instructed).

    		   -   -   -

For questions/problems please join the Fedora MinGW mailing list.

We're happy to inform you  that OCaml Batteries Included alpha 3 is now
available for download [1] and/or GODI installation. You may find the
new documentation on-line [2], as well as release notes [3], extended
release notes [4] and the slides for the OCaml Meeting talk [5]. The
list of changes is a tad too long to present here, but the important
part is that we're progressing towards maturity.

Enjoy!

Some people at the users meeting were asking me about the new OCaml 
book, so here are the details:

I have *not* read the book, but I'm hoping that the publisher is going 
to send me a review copy shortly, and once I've had a look through it 
I will be able to say more about whether it's any good (hopefully!) 

Conversely if you have read the book, please let us know if you liked it.
