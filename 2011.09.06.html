&gt; If you want just to structure your program, modules are better in most cases.
&gt; There are still situations where classes are stronger than modules for 
&gt; structuring:
&gt; * when you have a default for some operation, but want to be able to change it
&gt; * when you want to mix components, using multiple inheritance and virtual 
&gt; methods and instance variables

I second that. We are moving some parts of our code base to a mixin
style implemented with multiple inheritance, virtual methods,
constraints, very rare overridding (and no instance variables). This
results in drastic reduction of code size compared to our previous
approach where code sharing between components was implemented with
simple function calls. The code is also easier to evolve.

We create objects (without state) to represent bags of properties
computed from parameters; each method represents a property. An object
is created by assembling reusable mixins (inheritance) and
implementing remaining virtual methods. Once the object is created, we
observe a few properties and throw the object away. In effect, we use
objects to describe purely functional computation graphs, with
reusable sub-graphs. (Most methods don't take argument; in order to
avoid repeated evaluation, we have a special hack which rewrites an
object's method table so as to give its methods a lazy behavior.)

The nice thing with this approach is that the object layer does all
the plumbing automatically. Combining several reusable components does
not require to pass data around from one component to another
explicitly. The old style with functions required to pass many
arguments, deconstruct the result (a component typically computes
several things), organize reusable components to avoid mutual
recursions, and define many data types (records to represent the
result of components). In some cases, a large amount of the code was
caused by such plumbing.

&gt; Also, for various reasons, objects are not beginner friendly.
&gt; I think the main problem is that they don't fit that well with type inference:
&gt; both subtyping and polymorphic methods require explicit type annotations.

Time to advertise the implicit-subtyping branch?
      </pre><i>Jacques Garrigue then replied:</i><br /><pre>
Indeed the implicit-subtyping branch helps: if the compiler knows all
the types, it doesn't force you to write a coercion by hand.  On the
other hand, this is only a partial solution, as my comment was on the
lack of principality: you still need type annotations in many cases.
Constraint-based type inference might recover this principality, but
since the types inferred get even worse than with structural object
types, I'm afraid this is not really practical. (It might work better
with nominal subtyping.)

This release comes right after an earthquake and a hurricane so you
know this is going to be strong stuff!
This is our latest and greatest release of Jane street Core and
supporting libraries. For this release we've decided to move towards a
versioning scheme that is more coherent to our internal system so
everything is version 107.01.
With this release Sexplib Typeconv and Bin-prot are no longer
included. This is because we've merged back with Markus's version and
now release them from ocamlforge. They are packaged with oasis thus
bringing you the easiest to build, most portable release yet.
Sexplib and Bin-prot have had version bumps to fix compatibility
issues found while packaging Core. You should grab the latest version
while they are hot at:

_Sexplib (7.0.2) : <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/sexplib/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/sexplib/</a>
_Bin-prot (2.0.3): <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/bin-prot/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/bin-prot/</a>
This release of bin-prot also includes contributions by Stéphane
Glondu to make it portable on all the architectures that debian is
compiled for. Thank you Stéphane!

All the other libraries are download-able from our own webpage
(<a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/13">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/13</a>)
The released libraries now all come with a [doc] build target that
extracts the ocamldoc HTML documentation. This documentation can also
be browsed online on our website.

_Fieldslib(107.01): Just a version bump
_Core(107.01): Core's support for Timezones has been improved. The
effort to provide a coherent,typesafe approach to programming carries
on with new types and module to deal with identifiers, ip host/port
couple etc...
_Core_extended(107.01):
  New wrapper for Posix_clocks.
More function to handle backward and forward compatibility in sexp
Sexp_extended.
[Types] is a module used to do type runtime introspection of ocaml
values (by using an universal value).

New in this release:

_Variantslib(107.01): A syntax extension to scaffold constructor
functions and accessors automatically from variant type definitions.
_Patdiff(107.01): Patdiff is a nifty diffing code utility that
generates diffs designed to be read by humans and not computers. It
uses the patience-diff algorithm to do inter-line and intra-line and
diffs.

I am working with a file format the contains 32 bit integers.
I need to use int32 on 32 bit systems.  I would like to use plain
integers, unboxed and with native machine operations, on 64 bit
systems.

Is there any way to convince ocamlopt to choose between int and
int32 representations _at compile time_?

I could use first class modules to select implementations at
runtime, which is not worth the code complexity and still
requires an indirect function call to add numbers.  I could
conditionally compile different files depending on word size,
which strikes me as an ugly and fragile solution.

I want to be able to write "int32" and have that be compiled
like an ordinary integer type if 32 bits and tag fit into a
word, and as a boxed type otherwise.  (The compiler could
mask off excess precision if desired.)  Is there a reason ocaml
can't provide this?

Another implementation would have each instance of an int32 or
int64 be boxed or not depending on whether the value fits into
a word.  I don't know whether this would be faster or slower in
practice.  There is a tradeoff between allocations and
conditional branches.
      </pre><i>Hezekiah M. Carty replied:</i><br /><pre>
You may be able to use ideas/implementation from the Int63 module:

<a href="http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-df/html/Int63.html">http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-df/html/Int63.html</a>
or
<a href="http://www.janestreet.com/ocaml/janestreet-ocamldocs/core/Int63.html">http://www.janestreet.com/ocaml/janestreet-ocamldocs/core/Int63.html</a>

The Int63 module uses int internally on 64bit OCaml installations and
Int64.t internally on 32bit OCaml installations.  I am not familiar
with the details but it may be adaptable to your needs.
      </pre><i>Richard W.M.Jones also replied:</i><br /><pre>
The Bitstring module could use this too ...
      </pre><i>Gerd Stolpmann also replied:</i><br /><pre>
The Netnumber module of Ocamlnet actually does this:

<a href="https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mli">https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mli</a>
<a href="https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mlp">https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mlp</a>

Netnumber is fairly standalone, so you could just copy it to your
project if you don't want all of Ocamlnet.
      </pre><i>rixed asked and John Carr replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; I suppose you don't want to use any kind of preprocessor, do you ?

I'd rather not preprocess (or compile alternate files).  Both the
netnumber and core implementations use a preprocessor.

Preprocessor-based solutions have two problems.  One is the extra
compilation step.  Another is bitrot in the unused case.

I think it was Plan 9 where the documentation said don't use the
C preprocessor, our compiler does the right thing with if (false).
In ocaml what I'd like to say is

        module Int : sig
          type t
          val add : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
          ...
        end;
        module Intfast : Int = struct type t = int ... end
        module Int = if sixtyfour then Int end else Int32

with the understanding that the expression sixtyfour is evaluated
at compile time.

Here is some similar code using 3.12 syntax:

        module type M = sig type t val add : t -&gt; t -&gt; t val of_int : int -&gt; 
t end;;
        module Int : M = struct type t = int let add = (+) let of_int x = x 
end;;
        module M = (val (if Sys.word_size = 64 then (module Int : M) else 
(module Int32 : M)) : M);;

        let f x = M.add (M.of_int x) (M.of_int 1)

If the test (Sys.word_size = 64) is replaced by (true) this does what
I want.  The compiler looks through the packing and unpacking and
sees the module Int.  The body of function f compiles to a machine add
instruction.

Ocamlopt does not evaluate (Sys.word_size = 64) at compile time
because Sys.word_size is initialized at runtime.  See sys.ml line 26
and run objinfo on sys.cmx.

INRIA developers, is it easy to add an intrinsic so we can write

        extern word_size : int = "%caml_word_size"

in sys.ml?  If sys.cmx has a constant definition, ocamlopt should do
constant folding on conditional expressions testing Sys.word_size.

If I want to do conditional compilation, can ocamlbuild be taught
"compile file a.ml as module X on 32 bit systems and module b.ml as
module X on 64 bit systems"?
      </pre><i>Later on, John Carr added:</i><br /><pre>
I found a simpler way to make Sys.word_size be a compile time constant.
See patch at end.  Technically this is preprocessing, which I wanted to
avoid, but it's not preprocessing in my code.

I think the (old) reason of the way Sys.word_size is implemented is that
the same code can run both on 32 bits and 64 bits, when compiled to
bytecode. But of course, I see no reason why such a primitive could not
be added, with different compilation schemes for asm (it would be hard
coded) and bytecode (it would continue to call the runtime function).

I have a limited plan (3GB) on an USB 3G stick (ppp0 interface), better to monitor it.

Need to store the counters in a persistent way because when deconnecting/reconnecting, counters reset. 

I realized later there was an easier way by parsing /proc/net/dev instead of parsing ifconfig output. I'll switch to that later.
