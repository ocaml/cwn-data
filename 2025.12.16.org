Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-repository-archival-next-run-scheduled-2026-01-01/17587/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


Dear everyone,

we did another run of the archival based on the x-maintenance-intent of opam packages. The run was using [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/tree/d684c896eb6f7e6030d6ee65338d9db22a612f01][opam-repository at commit d684c896eb6f7e6030d6ee65338d9db22a612f01]] (Dec 9th, 20:00:00 CET).

The tool used is [[https://github.com/hannesm/maintenance-intent-filter/tree/14d3d80ed1d26f2779f0ced3e3b9852bc59ac7fb][maintenance-intent-filter]] with opam 2.5 and OCaml 5.4. It took around 1GB of memory and around 100h of CPU time ([[https://robur.coop/Donate][donations welcome]]).

In total, 4510 packages were candidates, out of which 3361 are scheduled for archival.

*** Testing

To test whether your CI / lock / environment will be affected by the removal of packages, you can create a fresh opam switch and use the opam-repository from the branch:

#+begin_example
$ opam repository add archival-20260101 https://github.com/hannesm/opam-repository.git#archival-20260101
$ opam switch create archival-20260101  --repositories archival-20260101
$ eval `opam env`
#+end_example

Alternatively, in CI systems you can do temporarily for testing:
#+begin_example
$ opam repo set-url default https://github.com/hannesm/opam-repository.git#archival-20260101
#+end_example

*** Reverting archival

If you want to preserve a package, please don’t hesitate to comment on the issue https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/29058

It is important that you include the package name and its version, as well as where it is used (preferably a URL), and a contact (email address).

/Editor’s note: please follow the archive link for the list of packages to be archived./

** Calascibetta Romain announced


I am pleased to announce the development of [[https://github.com/robur-coop/blame.git][~blame~]], a unikernel that provides a search engine in the form of a web interface based on an email archive.

This work is sponsored by [[https://nlnet.nl/][NLnet]] as part of our [[https://nlnet.nl/project/PTT/][PTT]] project. For more details on the unikernel, our archive system, and our search engine, we recommend reading our article available [[https://blog.robur.coop/articles/2025-04-12-ptt-search-webapp.html][here]]. This project is the synthesis of several projects on the subject:
- [[https://github.com/mirage/mrmime][mrmime]] to parse/encode emails
- [[https://github.com/robur-coop/carton][carton]] to archive emails
- [[https://github.com/robur-coop/stem][stem]] to search emails
- [[https://github.com/dinosaure/blaze][blaze]] like a Swiss Army knife for manipulating emails and archives
- and of course some of our projects like [[https://github.com/robur-coop/miou][miou]], [[https://github.com/robur-coop/utcp][utcp]] or [[https://github.com/robur-coop/vif][vif]]

If you like our work, you can sponsor us [[https://github.com/sponsors/robur-coop][via GitHub]] or by following the instructions available [[https://robur.coop/Donate][here]]. Thank you to everyone who has participated in the development of these projects, whether directly or indirectly.

So, happy hacking "discriminating hackers" :) !
      



* A new kind of knowledge-base for OCaml's doc
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-new-kind-of-knowledge-base-for-ocamls-doc/17593/1

** Mostafa Touny announced


Hello,

I have been following @sabine's post, https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/looking-for-maintainers-moderators-for-the-ocaml-cookbook/16497.

I really want to contribute but like any engineer, I am pressured on deadlines, which incentivizes me to ask here or in Discord. There are even wonderful books like [[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/type-theory-and-formal-proof/0472640AAD34E045C7F140B46A57A67C][Type Theory and Formal Proof]], but I cannot allocate good time to read them.

That motivated me to think of a new mechanism, where documentations and question-answers are bridged, through [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/about][Snippet]] project.

Someone asks a question like [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/question/2/show][this]]. Instead of answering the question, you must contribute a self-contained paragraph, called "snippet", then cite it in the question. For example the question cites:
- snippet [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/snippet/25/show][Parametric Abstraction with Functors and Modules]] design pattern in OCaml, citing
- snippet [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/snippet/26/show][Functor, OCaml]] linking to OCaml's doc, citing
- snippet [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/snippet/28/show][Functor, PL]] linking to Category theory blog, citing
- snippet [[https://snippet.mostafatouny.com/snippet/27/show][Abstract Data Types]] linking to Software Foundations book.

If some snippet gets a high number of citations, then that would be a signal to contribute it to OCaml's documentations or [[https://ocamlverse.net/][OCamlverse]]. In other words, OCaml's cookbooks will be naturally contributed as more people's questions get answered, and will be naturally certified as more people cite it!

The project is built on Dream, open-source, and CC 4.0 licensed. I'd be happy to see OCaml's maintainers self-host an instance of it in OCaml's official website. We could even design a voting mechanism to elect snippets for the official documentation.

For now, I am happy to listen to your feedback.
      



* Serialport - new serial communication library
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-serialport-new-serial-communication-library/17594/1

** Mikhail announced


Hi there!

I'm happy to announce the first release of the [[https://github.com/dx3mod/serialport][serialport]] library. The library is planned to be a cross-platform library for serial port communication in OCaml, which supports both POSIX and Windows systems. It provides synchronous and asynchronous interfaces using various I/O libraries (like Lwt and other).

The library currently only supports POSIX systems.

#+attr_html: :width 80%
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dx3mod/402ef4c5f3f06645c6c7100da2e8676f/raw/31f21f19923ed2dd4a1a477d8cbbc1d06d59f07b/serialport.svg

The main motivation behind creating this project is to address the lack of a comprehensive library for managing serial port communication in different environments, as well as the lack of an intuitive API for this task. The existing [[https://github.com/m-laniakea/oserial][OSerial]] library has significant limitations in terms of functionality and future development, making it unsuitable for use in modern environments.

The serial port library is most inspired by similar implementations in other languages, such as Rust's serialport and Golang's bugst/go-serial.

*** Usage

Typically, an example of usage is communication between a PC and an Arduino board or other devices via an old-school serial port.

#+begin_src ocaml
# #require "serialport.unix";;
 (* #require "serialport.lwt";; *)

# let port_opts = Serialport.Port_options.make ~baud_rate:9600 ()
  and port_name = "/dev/ttyUSB0" in

  Serialport_unix.with_open_communication ~opts:port_opts port_name
    begin fun ser_port ->
      (* Get channels abstractions for high-level working with I/O without buffering. *)
      let ic, oc = Serialport_unix.to_channels ser_port in
      (* Wait until Arduino has been initialized. *)
      Unix.sleep 2;
      (* Send the message to the Arduino via the serial port. *)
      Out_channel.output_string oc "Hello from PC!\n";
      (* Read the response from the serial port. *)
      In_channel.input_line ic
    end
#+end_src

Enjoy it!

*** Windows supports 

I will be implementing Windows support in the next version (coming soon).

*** P.S.

I would be delighted to discuss your ideas and suggestion!
      



* Lwt.6.0.0~beta (direct-style, multi-domain parallelism)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-lwt-6-0-0-beta-direct-style-multi-domain-parallelism/17283/8

** Raphaël Proust announced


~lwt.6.0.0-beta01~ has been released!

With this release comes a change in the title of this thread:
#+begin_src diff
- [ANN] Lwt.6.0.0~beta (direct-style, multi-domain parallelism)
+ [ANN] Lwt.6.0.0~beta (direct-style, runtime-event tracing)
#+end_src

This is likely the last beta before the release of Lwt.6.0.0, please test and share your feedback. The highlights are
- (compared to previous beta) no more multidomain-multischeduler parallelism
    - it was too buggy,
    - you can still use ~Lwt_domain~
- (compared to previous beta) runtime-events produce a trace of execution of your lwt program for better debugging
    - only if ~lwt_runtime_events~ is installed,
    - tracing instructions added by ppx,
    - example producing a trace of recent events in case of crash in https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/tree/6.0.0-beta01/examples/tracing
    - example live monitoring the events to send signal in case of stall in https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/tree/6.0.0-beta01/examples/stall_detection
- (compared to Lwt.5.9) direct-style with ~Lwt_direct~
    - you can write direct-style lwt (within a given scope)
    - e.g., you can interact with libraries that only provide ~iter : ('a -> unit) -> 'a -> unit~ such as
      #+begin_src ocaml
        let iter_s f h =
          Lwt_direct.spawn @@ fun () ->
            Hashtbl.iter (fun k v -> Lwt_direct.await (f k v)) h
      #+end_src

Once again, thanks to @c-cube for the direct-style feature which makes it possible to use Lwt in conjunction with libraries even if they don't include special amenities for it.

Thanks again for @edwin for the bug report on multi-scheduler-related failures.
