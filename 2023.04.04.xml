I'm pleased to announce the first release of [OCaml-css](https://zoggy.frama.io/ocaml-css/), a library to parse and
print CSS. It can also expand namespaces and perform computations on property values.

Parsing uses [Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom/) to dynamically choose the parser when
encountering a property declaration. Not all properties are handled yet but the parser can be extended by defining
additional properties. Some shorthand properties are handled too. Some ~@rule~s are not handled by now, they are
parsed and returned as strings, with a warning in log.

The ~css~ package should be available soon in opam.

Hi, I'm pleased to announce an ongoing series of tutorials for [Bogue](https://github.com/sanette/bogue) (the
Desktop GUI library for OCaml):

https://github.com/sanette/bogue-tutorials

So far only three are written:
- [Hello world](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/hello.html)
- [A simple counter](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/counter.html)
- [Self-modifying layouts](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/modif_parent.html)

More will come when time permits!

Each tutorial includes code that can either be pasted onto a toplevel, or automatically executed (the executables
are shipped in the ~ocaml-tutorials~ opam package.

Feedback appreciated! (hopefully constructive ;) )

      <cwn_title>Embedded Ocaml Templates 0.8</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-embedded-ocaml-templates-0-8/11848/1</cwn_url>

I am quite happy to announce the release of EML 0.8.
EML is a simple templating language that lets you generate text with plain OCaml. It is analogous to the way you
would write PHP pages, but the language being Ocaml instead.

There are two ways of using it, the first one is in a standalone file, for instance ~resume.eml.tex~ :

#+begin_example
&lt;%# firstname lastname email birthdate phonenumber formations %&gt;
\documentclass[10pt, a4paper, roman, french]{moderncv}
\usepackage{babel}
\firstname{ &lt;%-firstname%&gt; }
\familyname{ &lt;%-lastname%&gt; }
\mobile{&lt;%- phonenumber%&gt;}
\extrainfo{Born &lt;%-birthdate%&gt; }
\email{ &lt;%-email%&gt; }
\begin{document}
	\makecvtitle
	\section{Formation}
	 &lt;% List.iteri (fun i (date_start, date_end, diploma, school) -&gt;%&gt;
		\cventry{ &lt;%i- i %&gt; &lt;%-date_start%&gt; -- &lt;%-date_end%&gt;}{&lt;%-diploma%&gt;}{&lt;%-school%&gt;}{}{}{}
	 &lt;%) formations ;%&gt;
\end{document}
#+end_example

There is also support for compiling a whole recursive directory of templating files with a single dune rule.

The other one would be in OCaml code with a PPX :
#+begin_src ocaml
let resume  firstname lastname email birthdate phonenumber formations =
  {%eml|
\documentclass[10pt, a4paper, roman, french]{moderncv}
\usepackage{babel}
\firstname{ &lt;%-firstname%&gt; }
\familyname{ &lt;%-lastname%&gt; }
\mobile{&lt;%- phonenumber%&gt;}
\extrainfo{Born &lt;%-birthdate%&gt; }
\email{ &lt;%-email%&gt; }
\begin{document}
	\makecvtitle
	\section{Formation}
	 &lt;% List.iteri (fun i (date_start, date_end, diploma, school) -&gt;%&gt;
		\cventry{ &lt;%i- i %&gt; &lt;%-date_start%&gt; -- &lt;%-date_end%&gt;}{&lt;%-diploma%&gt;}{&lt;%-school%&gt;}{}{}{}
	 &lt;% ) formations ;%&gt;
\end{document}
|}
#+end_src
The ppx is also suitable for simple string interpolation.

A similar templating and homonymous templating engine is present in the Dream framework. Dream.EML has a slightly
different syntax, mine is less geared toward HTML and more suitable for general templating. Dream also does not
support compiling multiple templates with a single dune rule.

In 0.8, the locations in the PPX are finally correct. This means that type errors will show up in their correct
place, which is very nice (once a small bugfix in merlin is merged (the error message is still correct)).
I also got rid of a depency on Menhir.

It is available on opam as the ~embedded_ocaml_templates~ package, and the doc is
[here](https://github.com/EmileTrotignon/embedded_ocaml_templates/blob/master/README.md)

Here’s a thread to announce your availability as an OCaml developer looking for an OCaml job. :rocket:

Freelancers, contractors and job-seekers, do advertise your services and experience here.

Since the volume on these threads is still fairly low, let's go with one thread for the rest of 2023 that I will
bump every quarter.

/editor’s note: please follow the link above to see the replies to this thread./

I am currently trying my hand at writing down my weekly activity on the OCaml compiler as blog post on the Cambium
team blog:

http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/florian-weekly-2023-04-03

This week the main and only topics is some ongoing work on mine on an alternative handling for partial error
messages in the compiler. The medium-term objective is to move slowly towards machine-readable error message by
making that all the type used in error report internally in the compiler are serializable. This has lead towards a
fun path of implementing an alternative format string interpreter that you can see in action at
https://github.com/Octachron/format-doc .
