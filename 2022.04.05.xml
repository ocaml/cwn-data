      <cwn_who>Arseniy Alekseyev announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We are pleased to announce the v0.15 release of Jane Street packages!

This release comes with 41 new packages, and a large number of fixes and
enhancements. The documentation for the individual packages will soon be available on
[v3.ocaml.org/packages](https://v3.ocaml.org/packages), after some technical issues are fixed.

The remainder of this e-mail highlights the main changes since the v0.14
release.

*** Notable changes

**** Re-structuring of ~Core~.

The most noticeable breaking change is the re-structuring of ~Core~.

In 0.14, ~Core~ is somewhat bloated and includes many modules that are barely ever used,
many of which are Unix-specific. In 0.15, many of those modules moved to separate libraries,
most of them to package~core_unix~, and ~core~ is now much smaller and no longer
contains unix-specific code.

The mapping between the new libraries and the old modules can be summarized by the contents of ~Core_compat~ library
v0.14:

#+begin_src ocaml
module Command_unix = Core.Command
module Date_unix = Core.Date
module Filename_unix = Core.Filename
module Signal_unix = Core.Signal
module Sys_unix = Core.Sys
module Core_thread = Core.Thread
module Time_unix = Core.Time
module Time_ns_unix = Core.Time_ns
module Core_unix = Core.Unix
module Version_util = Core.Version_util

module Interval_lib = struct
  module Interval = Core.Interval
  module Interval_intf = Core.Interval_intf
end

module Time_interface = Core.Time_common
#+end_src

**** Async: ~Monitor.try_with~

~Monitor.try_with~ and related functions changed the defaults for their ~run~ and ~rest~ parameters.
They used to default to ~~~run:~Schedule ~rest:~Log~~, but now they default to ~~~run:~Now ~rest:~Raise~~.

*** Many other changes

There are many changes and additions across 130+ existing packages, and
unfortunately we don't maintain a changelog to list them all.
The code for all of our packages is on our [github](https://github.com/janestreet),
and if you're interested in the details of what changed in a particular package,
you can inspect the diff between branches v0.14 and v0.15.

[~ppx_type_directed_value~](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_type_directed_value): Get [@@deriving]-style generation
of type-directed values without writing a ppx

~Ppx_type_directed_value~ is a ppx that does ~[@@deriving]~-style
generation of type-directed values based on user-provided modules. The
user-provided modules tell ~ppx_type_directed_value~ how to compose
type-directed values (for example, combine type-directed values of the
fields of a record to form a type-directed value for the record
itself).

This allows a wide variety of PPXs such as ~ppx_sexp_conv~,
~ppx_compare~, ~ppx_enumerate~, etc. to be implemented with
~ppx_type_directed_value~, but with some runtime cost.

This PPX currently supports deriving type-directed values for records, ordinary

on record and variant fields.

      <cwn_who>David Sancho announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm creating a post as a header from this season of *EmelleTV* in 2020. Will use this post to share announcements,
new shows, gather feedback and invite you to watch and follow
[https://www.twitch.tv/emelletv](https://www.twitch.tv/emelletv)!

For the ones who doesn't know us, It's a streaming show that will happen once per month and will try to interview and
talk casually about OCaml, Reason, ReScript and their communities. Inviting interesting engineers and ask silly
questions about literally anything.

If can't attend live, we publish the VOD in youtube under
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvVVfCa7-nzSuCdMKXnNJNQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvVVfCa7-nzSuCdMKXnNJNQ).
You can re-watch some of the 2021 interviews, they were a ton of fun for me.

It's made by myself and @fakenickels.

Feel free to share any feedback, propose any guest or make fun of us ^^

Feel free to give your feedback as well. I tried to make it like the iOS/macOS version. For now, the only missing
feature is syntax highlighting, but I'm working on it (I still have a few bugs with it)

Thanks for your replies @silene @zozozo !  Due to project interest I need to understand the runtime value
representation. Now I released a little library for displaying runtime values in textual form:
