Richard Eisenberg announced
───────────────────────────

  I’m excited to share that Jane Street has opened up a visiting
  position to work with our type systems team to improve and formalize
  various aspects of our extensions to OCaml. This position is
  envisioned to sit between graduation from a PhD program and the start
  of a tenure-track professorship at a research institution. Candidates
  might already have a faculty offer in hand and be taking a gap year,
  or they might be seeking a more traditional postdoc. The visit can
  last one or two years. It will be research-focused, with a goal of
  publishing several papers in top venues. The visitor will be able to
  see firsthand how language improvements affect the users all around us
  in our office. This will be a great opportunity at combining the
  theoretical and practical aspects of research in our field.

  Full details and next steps are at
  <https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/visiting-researcher-prefaculty/>

  I’ll be supervising this position. Happy to answer any questions over
  email at reisenberg@janestreet.com.


Vg 9.5.0 – Declarative 2D vector graphics
═════════════════════════════════════════

Daniel Bünzli announced
───────────────────────

  Hello,

  It’s my pleasure to announce the release 0.9.5 of Vg:

        Vg is a declarative 2D vector graphics library. Images are
        values that denote functions mapping points of the
        cartesian plane to colors and combinators are provided to
        define and compose them.

        Renderers for PDF, SVG, Cairo and the HTML canvas are
        distributed with the library. An API allows to implement
        new renderers.

        Vg is distributed under the ISC license.

  Except for the addition of combinators to [smoothly stitch] Bézier
  paths by François Thiré, this is mostly a bureaucratic and maintenance
  release.

  At the library level, the `Vgr_svg' module is now part of the `vg'
  library and the `vg.svg' library is deprecated. The `Vgr_htmlc' canvas
  renderer has been rewritten with [brr] which becomes an optional
  dependency of the package while the dependencies on `js_of_ocaml' and
  `js_of_ocaml-ppx' are dropped for good.

  Ten years ago neither dark themes nor `.mld' files did exist so the
  [tutorial], the [semantics] and the [image howto] have been slightly
  reworked and moved out of the Vg module documentation to their own
  pages and the doc images have been fixed to work in dark themes.

  Read the [release notes] for all the other changes.

  • Homepage: <https://erratique.ch/software/vg>
  • API docs & manuals: <https://erratique.ch/software/vg/doc/>
  • Install: `opam install vg' ([opam pr])

  Best,

  Daniel

  A big thanks to my [donators].

Thibaut Mattio announced
────────────────────────

  Welcome to the eighth edition of the OCaml Platform newsletter!

  In this November and December edition, we are excited to bring you the
  latest on the OCaml Platform, continuing our tradition of highlighting
  recent developments as seen in [previous editions]. To understand the
  direction we’re headed, especially regarding development workflows and
  user experience improvements, check out our [roadmap].

  *Highlights:*
  • The `odoc' team is starting work on improving `odoc' performances.
    After shipping important features, including a link to source code,
    syntax for tables, and recent support for search, they are turning
    their focus on consolidating the full documentation generation stack
    (including Dune rules and integration with OCaml.org package docs)
    and improving performances.
  • [opam 2.2~alpha3 is out]! It is the last alpha release, and the opam
    team plans to start the beta release next cycle.
  • Anticipating on the January update, the compiler PR necessary for
    Merlin project-wide references has been merged! This will be part of
    OCaml 5.2, meaning that starting with the next compiler version,
    OCaml developers will be able to query for project-wide references
    (and limited support for project-wide rename!) in their projects.
    Read more [here] to know how you can test the feature.

  *Releases:*
  • [Odoc 2.4.0]
  • [OCaml LSP 1.17.0]
  • [Merlin 4.13]
  • [Dune 3.12.1]
  • [opam 2.2.0~alpha3]

*[Dune]* Exploring Package Management in Dune ([W4])
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  *Contributed by:* @rgrinberg (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV (Tarides),
  @gridbugs (Tarides), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides), @Alizter

  *Why:* Unify OCaml tooling under a single command line for all
  development workflows. This addresses one of the most important pain
  points [reported by the community].

  *What:* Prototyping the integration of package management into Dune
  using opam as a library. We’re introducing a `dune pkg lock' command
  to generate a lock file and enhancing `dune build' to handle
  dependencies in the lock file. More details in the [Dune RFC].

  *Activities:*
  • Introduced a locking mechanism to prevent conflicts in multiple
    repositories and fixed a bug in Dune’s locking code. –
    [ocaml/dune#9140]
  • Enabled project locking without a network connection using locally
    cached `opam-repository'. – [ocaml/dune#9202]
  • Enhanced handling of `opam-repositories' with non-standard contents
    (non-file objects). – [ocaml/dune#9352]
  • Added a feature where users can set arbitrary variables which can be
    referred to by opam packages while solving a project’s dependencies.
    This gives users more control over decisions made by the solver and
    which dependencies their project ends up having in its `lockdir'. –
    [ocaml/dune#9325]
  • Ensured `lockdir' contains all dependencies of local packages for
    consistency. This prevents Dune from presenting inconsistent
    information to users who have changed their project’s dependencies
    after creating a `lockdir'. Instead, they’ll be prompted to
    recompute their `lockdir'. – [ocaml/dune#9156]
  • Ability to detect which dependencies in the `lockdir' are only
    needed when building tests. This will be necessary to allow users to
    skip downloading and building packages that are only needed for
    testing unless they are running tests. – [ocaml/dune#9095]
  • Improved support for Windows, focusing on better Curl integration
    and opam library adjustments for Windows architectures. –
    [ocaml/dune#9252], [ocaml/dune#9048]
  • Refined context/lock file handling in Dune package management. –
    [ocaml/dune#9343]
  • Refined context/lock file handling. Before each context had an
    associated lock file so lock files were selected via context
    arguments. Now the context middlemen have been removed and the users
    selects lock files by specifying the lockfile itself. This applies
    to most pkg related commands. – [ocaml/dune#9343]
  • Added support for the `conflicts' field in opam files –
    [ocaml/dune#9340]
  • Looked into solutions to add support for deptops – [ocaml/dune#9430]
  • Writing the PID of process that created the lock file
    [ocaml/dune#9295] to be able to easily determine which process is
    holding the revision store lock
  • Avoid Git translating its CLI [ocaml/dune#9390]. Since we use the
    Git binary under the hood, users with different locales might get
    translated Git output. Since our Git output is not shown to the
    user, we disable translation.
  • Remove `opam-repository-url' option [ocaml/dune#9373] Removes all
    CLI options that deal with repositories. All `opam-repositories' are
    now controlled in the `dune-workspace' file.
  • Support for specifying particular branches/commits for repos
    [ocaml/dune#9241] adds support for specifying branches and commits
    as `opam-repository' sources, so the user can fix one particular
    state of `opam-repository'
  • Enable checking out tags [ocaml/dune#9471] adds the same support as
    above but for tags. It does so by saving the tags in per-remote
    namespaces, thus it works very much like branches.
  • Implement downloading sources via Git [ocaml/dune#9506] enables
    cloning source directories via the rev store, thus caching most
    commits when working with multiple projects from the same repo, etc.
  • Read the main branch correctly even if tags exist [ocaml/dune#9549]
    fixes an issue where the code that determines the tracking branch
    got confused in the presence of namespaced tags.
  • Dune will compute checksums for lock files of packages which don’t
    already have checksums in their opam metadata. – [ocaml/dune#9384]
  • Package metadata for a Dune project can be read from `.opam' files
    rather than `dune-project' – [ocaml/dune#9418]
  • Support for conflict classes in opam files for the solver –
    [ocaml/dune#9442]
  • The ability to add additional constraints to feed the solver –
    [ocaml/dune#9337]

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  *Contributed by:* @rjbou (OCamlPro), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides), @dra27
  (Tarides), @AltGr (OCamlPro)

  *Why:* Enhance OCaml’s viability on Windows by integrating native opam
  and `opam-repository' support, fostering a larger community and more
  Windows-friendly packages.

  *What:* Releasing opam 2.2 with native Windows support, making the
  official `opam-repository' usable on Windows platforms.

  *Activities:* /FROM KATE/
  • We’ve released [opam 2.2.0~alpha3], a culmination of the last 4
    months of work. This release, amongst other fixes and improvements,
    adds a new `x-env-path-rewrite' field necessary for Windows support.
    - [#5636]
  • We’ve also fixed a number of issues on Windows:
    • Fix issues in the C stubs for Windows - [#5714]
    • Fix incorrect error message in configure on Windows - [#5667]
    • Always resolve the fullpath to the `cygpath' executable - [#5716]

*[​`odoc'​]* Add Search Capabilities to `odoc' ([W25])
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  *Contributed by:* @panglesd (Tarides), @EmileTrotignon (Tarides),
  @julow (Tarides), @jonludlam (Tarides)

  *Why:* Improve usability and navigability in OCaml packages
  documentation, both locally and on OCaml.org, by offering advanced
  search options like type-based queries.

  *What:* Implementing a search engine interface in `odoc', complete
  with a UI and a search index. Additionally, we’re developing a default
  client-side search engine based on Sherlodoc.

  *Activities:* /FROM EMILE/
  • After merging [the PR that added support for search to `odoc'] in
    October, we continued work on building an `odoc'-compatible search
    engine based on [Sherlodoc]. This will give a search engine with
    type-based search for every package that uses `odoc'. The plan is to
    make Sherlodoc the search engine in Dune’s documentation generation.
    You can try an early demo on [Varray’s doc] – [art-w/sherlodoc#4]
  • Buiding on `odoc'’s support for search, we merged a PR that adds
    occurrences information to the search index. This will allows `odoc'
    search engines to improve the order of search results by using the
    number of occurences. – [ocaml/odoc#976]

  @dbuenzli, @gpetiot (Tarides)

  *Why:* Empower package authors to create rich, engaging documentation
  by enabling the integration of multimedia elements directly into OCaml
  package documentation.

  *What:* We’re introducing new syntax and support for embedding media
  (images, audio, videos) and handling assets within the `odoc'
  environment.

  *Activities:*
  • Added assets in the environment to treat them similarly as other
    resolvable elements. This addressed the remaining feedback from
    reviews, and if no other blocker is found, the PR should be ready to
    merge. – [ocaml/odoc#1002]

  *Contributed by:* @jonludlam (Tarides), @julow (Tarides), @gpetiot
   (Tarides)

  *Why:* Address performance issues in `odoc', particularly for
  large-scale documentation, to enhance efficiency and user experience,
  and unlock local documentation generation in large code bases.

  *What:* Profiling `odoc' to identify the main performance bottlenecks,
  and optimising `odoc' with the findings.

  *Activities:*
  • Experimented with different data structures and algorithms for more
    efficient documentation generation on large files.
    –[ocaml/odoc#1033], [ocaml/odoc#1036], [ocaml/odoc#1049]
  • Implemented item lookup improvements in signatures for faster
    processing. – [ocaml/odoc#1049]

  *Contributed by:* @jonludlam (Tarides)

  *Why:* Enhance the usability of locally-generated documentation by
  providing direct access to dependencies’ documentation.

  *What:* Implementing new Dune rules for `odoc' to enable efficient
  documentation generation and access to documentation for all opam
  packages in your switch.

  *Activities:*
  • The new Dune rules have been merged and are available in the newest
    release of Dune 3.12.1. Try running `dune build @doc-new' to
    generate your documentation and tell us what you think! –
    [ocaml/dune#8803]

  *Contributed by:* @voodoos (Tarides), @trefis (Tarides), @Ekdohibs
  (OCamlPro), @gasche (INRIA)

  *Why:* Enhance code navigation and refactoring for developers by
  providing project-wide reference editor features, aligning OCaml with
  the editor experience found in other languages.

  *What:* Introducing `merlin single occurrences' and LSP
  `textDocument/references' support, extending compiler’s Shapes for
  global occurrences, and integrating these features in Dune, Merlin,
  and OCaml LSP.

  *Activities:*
  • The first iteration on project-wide occurrences is closing-in, and
    we made a custom [`opam-repository'] to test the feature while the
    changes make their way into the upstream compiler. This gave us the
    opportunity to test the feature on more real projects, and after
    another round of bug-fixing and UI improvement we [opened it] to the
    community for wider testing.
  • Anticipating the January update, the [compiler PR] has been merged!
    :tada: The next steps are to revisit the patches on the other
    projects and to open PRs upstream. Dune is the next in line. –

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  *Contributed by:* @pitag (Tarides), @Engil (Tarides), @3Rafal
   (Tarides)

  *Why:* Some Merlin queries have been shown to scale poorly in large
  codebases, making the editor experience subpar, and users report that
  they sometimes must wait a few seconds to get the answer. This is
  obviously a major issue that hurts developer experience, so we’re
  working on improving Merlin performance when it falls short.

  *What:* Developing benchmarking tools and optimising Merlin’s
  performance through targeted improvements based on profiling and
  analysis of benchmark results.

  *Activities:*
  • We’ve made the file cache lifetime configurable. Varying the
    lifetime will allow experimenting with Merlin’s time/space
    trade-off. Before, it was constantly set to 5 min. -[#1698]
    • Introduced a config that lets users set a file cache lifespan.
      When modified to a larger value it should improve performance for
      large repositories – [ocaml/merlin#1698]
    • Introduced the file cache lifespan flag to `ocaml-lsp', so it can
      be used for all LSP clients – [ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1210]
  • We’ve enriched the telemetry that comes embedded in the

Upcoming Caqti Release - TLS, Packaging, and minor breakage

Petter A. Urkedal announced
───────────────────────────

  The next [Caqti] release is almost ready if I proceed as planned,
  though I would like to lift plans in advance in case anyone has
  feedback.

  While Caqti 2 brought support for MirageOS (using PGX), it is missing
  TLS, which limits its usability in practise. Patching that hole will
  be the main delivery for the upcoming release. This involved a
  revision of the network abstraction and better performance under EIO.

  Some more minor changes can be seen in [the preliminary change log].

Minor Breaking Changes
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  My plan is the make the upcoming one a minor release, but there will
  be two breaking changes, so we could discuss whether a minor release
  is reasonable:

  • There will be a new optional `?config' parameter for all functions
    which connect to a database or create a connection pool, which can
    break code which makes higher-order calls or aliases those parts of
    the signatures.

  • The `Caqti_query.t' type will have one additional constructor (`V'),
    which breaks any code which alias the type along with its
    constructors.


Packaging and TLS
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  TL;DR: This is mostly a request for comments about packaging.

  The Caqti project currently has 11 packages in the official OPAM
  repository. With the current plan, there will be an additional 4 TLS
  packages:

   `caqti-async', `caqti-eio', `caqti-lwt', `caqti-mirage'                                       required                
   `caqti-type-calendar'                                                                         convenience              could be retired             
   `caqti-tls'                                                                                   core TLS package         see below                    
   `caqti-tls-async', `caqti-tls-eio', `caqti-tls-lwt'                                           specialized TLS engines  see below                    
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  (For `caqti-mirage', TLS is included, since the `tls' library is the
  only option to encrypt PostgreSQL communication for unikernels, if not
  implemented at the network level, AFAIK.)

  As indicated above there could be options to eliminate two existing
  packages, but I’ll leave that for later. The alternatives I’ve
  considered for the TLS implementation and packaging is:

  1. The implemented choice is to use the `tls-async', `tls-eio',
     `tls-lwt', and `tls-mirage' instantiations of the TLS engine, thus
     adding one package per flavour.
  2. TLS support for Async, EIO, and LWT could instead be merged as
     sublibraries of `caqti-async', `caqti-eio', and `caqti-lwt', and
     `caqti-tls' could be merged into `caqti'. The main reason for not
     doing this, is the C bindings for MariaDB and PostgreSQL already
     have TLS built-in, so in most cases the `tls' dependency would be
     redundant. The dependencies could be made optional, though I have
     the impression many consider optional dependencies harmful.
  3. The Caqti network abstractions could use the pure TLS engine
     directly, thus requiring only one extra package, `caqti-tls'. This
     would be a elegant solution, except that it will not work with the
     `ssl' library should we want to support it, since it is tied to the
     network stack.

  While switching to the second option is simple, switching to the third
  option would require more work on my part, delaying the release, but I
  could be convinced if we feel strongly for the end result.

  The `caqti-tls' package is (currently) only needed to define a shared
  configuration key which depends on the `tls' library.

  Here is a (re-)recording of a talk I gave a few weeks ago at Tarides,
  about Ocsigen and Be Sport.

  Abstract:

        This presentation gives an overview of the [Ocsigen]
        framework, which is used in particular to develop the [Be
        Sport] social network. Ocsigen is a set a tools to develop
        Web sites and applications. Amongst other things, it
        contains [js_of_ocaml], a compiler to Javascript, and
        [Eliom], a powerful Web framework that can be used for
        traditional server-side Web programming, but also to
        develop client-server Web and mobile distributed
        applications, entirely in OCaml, using multi-tier
        programming. We will try to show how this programming
        style can save a huge amount of time.

  Hello OCaml Community!

  I’m excited to share the release of `validate' version 1.0.0 with you
  all! This version is a significant milestone in my journey to provide
  a robust data validation library for OCaml.

  In this release, I’ve introduced some exciting features. Variant
  support is now available, enabling more complex data types to be
  handled with ease. I’ve also implemented support for recursive and
  circular recursive types, allowing validation of nested and
  interconnected data structures. Here’s a quick peek at how it works:
  ┌────
  │ type tree =
  │   | Leaf of (int[@greater_than 0])
  │   | Node of {
  │     (*Annotation can be on type or label declaration, both works*)
  │     left : tree; [@dive]
  │     right : (tree[@dive])
  │   } [@@deriving validate, show, eq]
  │ 
  │ let my_tree = Node { left = Leaf 1; right = Leaf 2 }
  │ let validation_result = validate_tree my_tree
  └────
  I’m also excited to announce that the validate API is now stable.
  While I plan to keep enhancing the library by adding new annotations
  for different validators over time, I assure you of consistent and
  reliable functionality in future updates.

  If you have suggestions for new validators or features, we’d love to
  hear them. Your feedback is crucial in shaping the future of
  `validate' .

Congratulation to the OCaml team for the 2023 SIGPLAN programming languages software award! 🏆

Xavier Leroy announced
──────────────────────

  To follow up on @spdegabrielle’s nice message: the SIGPLAN PL Software
  Award 2023 was formally given to the OCaml development team last week
  at POPL 2024 in London, and I was very pleased and honored to give the
  reception speech on behalf of the team. For the record, I’ll post the
  speech next.


Xavier Leroy then said
──────────────────────

  It’s an honor for the whole OCaml development team to receive such a
  prestigious award. Some of us are here tonight: Gabriel Scherer,
  Damien Doligez, Florian Angeletti, Luc Maranget, David Allsopp,
  Stephen Dolan, Nicolas Ojeda Bär, and I’m Xavier Leroy. It’s two,
  almost three generations of computer scientists and developers that
  are being honored…

  There is no denying that OCaml has been a long-term project. I
  released the first version of OCaml, then called Objective Caml, in
  1996, almost 28 years ago. But it was already the consolidation of
  much earlier work, going back more than 50 years from now:

  • Robin Milner’s work on “ML”, the Meta Language (scripting language)
    of his LCF proof assistant, which introduced the lovely type system
    and type inference algorithm we all know.
  • Then Gérard Huet brought LCF ML back home to Rocquencourt on a
    magnetic tape, and liked it so much that with Guy Cousineau and
    their students, they developed CAML, an implementation of Milner’s
    ML using the CAM (the Categorical Abstract Machine) as intermediate
    language – hence the CAML name. And they used it as the
    implementation language for what was to become the Coq proof
    assistant.
  • Then, two students of Cousineau at ENS, Damien Doligez and I, fell
    in love with the CAML language and developed Caml Light, a
    lightweight, open-source implementation of CAML suitable for
    teaching and popularizing the language.

  So, the 1996 1.0 release of OCaml was already a consolidation of the
  CAML language, the memory management and virtual machine from Caml
  Light, my early 1990’s work on native compilation and Standard
  ML-style module systems, and Jérôme Vouillon’s PhD work on type
  systems and type inference for objects.

  Since then, OCaml has continued to pick up new features arising from
  PL research, such as Generalized Algebraic Data Types in the late
  2000’s, or very recently user-defined effects and effect handlers,
  making OCaml one of the first non-experimental languages to support
  effects. This arose from the Multicore OCaml project, along with
  support for shared-memory parallelism, at long last!, and a new
  relaxed memory model.

  But that’s not the only way in which OCaml has served and continues to
  serve research in programming languages. If you look at previous
  recipients for this SIGPLAN software system award, you’ll find the Coq
  proof assistant, which is implemented in OCaml; the CompCert C
  compiler, which also uses OCaml for its non-verified parts; as well as
  WebAssembly, whose reference interpreter is written in OCaml. And
  looking at possible future recipients, you’ll find Rust, whose first
  compiler was written in OCaml; STAN, the probabilistic programming
  language whose compiler was recently rewritten in OCaml; and JSCert,
  the Javascript formalization that also uses OCaml for its reference
  interpreter.

  Of course, these are not the only uses of OCaml! For something
  completely different: how many of you took the Eurostar train to come
  here? or flew an Airbus plane? Chances are that a good chunk of the
  software embedded in your plane or in your train was generated from
  SCADE block diagrams by an OCaml program, the SCADE KCG 6 compiler.

  So, we’re very proud of our greater user community and all they do
  with OCaml, both in classic application areas for ML languages such as
  theorem provers, proof assistants, static analyzers, verification
  tools, compilers, code generators, etc.; and in more unusual areas
  such as systems programming.

  When Damien and I were hacking Caml Light in 1990, we had no idea that
  10 years later the Ensemble people at Cornell and IBM would
  reimplement a whole network and protocol stack for distributed
  applications in OCaml and get better latency than their previous C++
  implementation. Then came real-time trading, web radios and audio
  streaming, the Irmin distributed database, Mirage unikernels that boot
  on a bare hypervisor, and more.

  What made that possible? Not just fancy types and nice modules – even
  though systems programmers value type safety and modularity highly –
  but also basic properties of OCaml:
  • a language with a simple cost model, where it’s easy to track how
    much time and how much space is used;
  • a compiler that produces efficient code that looks like the source
    code, with only predictable optimizations;
  • a low-latency garbage collector, usable for soft real-time
    applications. To us PL folks, this doesn’t sound like much. Good
    luck getting a paper accepted at POPL or PLDI based on these ideas!
    Yet, that’s crucial to open the way to many exciting applications.

  Will there be other chance encounters with new application areas like
  this for OCaml in the future? I have no idea – and that’s what makes
  PL research exciting, even after all these years!

  At any rate, we, the recipients of this award, are proud of the
  achievements of the OCaml user community, and deeply honored to see
  our efforts recognized by this award. Thank you!
