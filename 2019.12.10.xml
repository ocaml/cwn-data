      <cwn_title>Interesting OCaml Articles</cwn_title>

Found on *Lobste.rs*: Mark Karpov writes yet another [Haskell vs. OCaml](https://markkarpov.com/post/haskell-vs-ocaml.html) for old time's sake. I found it worth a read and a mention here.

p.s. He spends a bit of time in the intro lamenting the lack of a conventional Unicode string library for OCaml, and I feel that pain acutely, especially since I'm the author of an *unconventional* one, i.e. the [Ucs_text](https://bitbucket.org/jhw/orsetto/src/default/src/ucs/ucs_text.mli) module in my [Orsetto](https://bitbucket.org/jhw/orsetto) project.
