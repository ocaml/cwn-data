Hi there!

I am excited to announce the release of the [intel_hex](https://github.com/dx3mod/intel_hex) library. This library is a manipulation library that provides functions for reading, writing, and creating Intel HEX data, which is a common format used in embedded system programming.


#+begin_src ocaml
Intel_hex.Record.
  [
      Extended_segment_address 0x0F;
      Data (0x0000, "Hello ");
      Data (0x0007, "World!");
      End_of_file;
  ]
|> Intel_hex.records_to_string 
|> print_endline
#+end_src

#+begin_example
:02000002000FED
:0600000048656C6C6F20E6
:06000700576F726C6421CA
:00000001FF
#+end_example

Also, you can of course read the IHEX object file from other sources:
#+begin_src ocaml
In_channel.with_open_text "data.hex" Intel_hex.object_of_channel
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
- : Intel_hex.Object.t = 
{ 
  start_linear_address = 0;
  start_segment_address = {cs = 0; ip = 0};
  chunks = [(240, "Hello "); (247, "World!")]
}
#+end_src

Limitations

32-bitness. To represent 32-bit integers, the library uses the OCaml int data type. This may be problematic for 32-bit systems, as it can lead to overflow errors, but it works fine for most 64-bit systems.

Start addressing and extending addressing. Not fully supported for real-world use. I would appreciate your pull request on this!

Hello all! Been working on [layoutz](https://github.com/mattlianje/layoutz/tree/master/layoutz-ocaml), a tiny, zero-dep combinator lib for making pretty, structured, terminal output: tables, trees, boxes, ANSI styled elements, etc.

Would love to hear how the API feels: Smooth? Any missing primitives you'd expect? Many thanks!

Hi everyone !

We are excited to officially invite you to the first Caml in the Capital meetup!
We have two fantastic talks planned, some free pizza 🍕 generously sponsored by the OCaml Software Foundation 🐪 and great company to chat with :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:

- *Registration link:* [HERE](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/caml-in-the-capital-feb-2026-tickets-1977730614507) *(Please register asap so we can anticipate)*
- *Date:* Thursday February 26th from 6:30pm to 8:30pm
- *Location:* Imperial College London, Flowers Building, Room FLOW G.47A.

*** Talks
**** Compile-time Computation for Caml
/by Jeremy Yallop/

(Abstract TBD)

**** Dynamic Verification of OCaml Software with ORTAC/QCheck-STM
/by Nikolaus Huber/

#+begin_quote
In this talk I would like to introduce the QCheck-STM plugin for ORTAC, a framework for dynamic verification of OCaml code. ORTAC/QCheck-STM consumes OCaml module signatures annotated with contracts expressed in the Gospel language and generates code for automated runtime assertion checking from it. I will highlight some details of the implementation of the tool, the structure of the generated code, and on errors found in established OCaml libraries.
#+end_quote

---

We are very much looking forward to meeting the OCaml community in London!

Cheers,
Alistair &amp; Sacha
