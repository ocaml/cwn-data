Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, for the week of February 12 to 19, 2013.

1) ocp-indent 1.0.0 release
2) Old and new OCaml installed on same machine?
3) Sequence 0.3.1
4) Other Caml News

1) ocp-indent 1.0.0 release
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-02/msg00128.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Continuing the thread from last week, Louis Gesbert announced:

Thanks for all the feedback and few bug reports during the past week of beta-
test.

We can now announce the 1.0.0 release of ocp-indent, available on opam.

I think you are looking for the opam -switch option.
It allows to "jump" from one version to another.

3) Sequence 0.3.1
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-02/msg00129.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Simon Cruanes announced:

I'm happy to announce the release of Sequence 0.3.1. Sequence is
designed to compose iterations over containers in a lightweight fashion.
The goal is to transfer values between containers, or to apply
transformations (map, filter, take, etc.) on several values without
caring about where they come from. It doesn't have any dependencies.

Sequence is not designed to be as general-purpose or flexible as, say,
Batteries' `Enum.t`. Rather, it aims at providing a very simple and
efficient way of iterating on a finite number of values, only allocating
(most of the time) a few intermediate closures to do so.

For instance, if you have an array and want to build a hashtable that
contains elements mapping to their index in the array, you can write:

> #require "sequence";;
> let a = [| "a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e" |];;
> let h = Hashtbl.create 3;;
> Sequence.hashtbl_add h
(Sequence.map (fun (x,y) -> y,x)
(Sequence.of_array_i a));;
> open Format;; (* to print h *)
> let pp_pair formatter (x,y) = fprintf formatter "%s -> %i" x y;;
> Sequence.pp_seq pp_pair std_formatter (Sequence.of_hashtbl h);;

A toy S-expression module, and a few tests are included but not compiled
by default (because they require OCaml >= 4.0). The code is free (BSD
license), hosted at <https://github.com/c-cube/sequence> and available on
OPAM (install with `opam install sequence`).
