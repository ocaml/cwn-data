** Continuing this thread from last week, whitequark said:

I wrote this tool long ago, it's called ppx_import[1]. In fact it motivated
some improvements to the compiler, chiefly the way to extract the set of -I
paths.
It's even linked from ppx_deriving README[2].

That paragraph predates [@with]. I've updated it now.

whitequark of course will know the exact details, but indeed ppx_import
seems capable to work in your use case, see:

<https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi/blob/master/serlib/ser_constrexpr.ml#L49>
      
** François Pottier then said and whitequark replied:

Unfortunately Emilio has the shortest implementation that's possible right now.
I think this would be a fairly straightforward addition to ppx_import.
      
** Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias finally said:

In the lines of François suggestion, it would be great if ppx_import
could some kind of "batch" import for modules. Imagine you want to add
show to a whole module, you could do:

[%import: M
  [@attach all [[@deriving show]]]]

or

module M = [%import M ....]

Another option is to teach deriving about modules:

module M = M
[@@deriving sexp]

but I am not sure what would be the best way to avoid all the
boilerplate I currently have [would had submitted an issue otherwise]

2) Feedback on cmdliner doc language changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Daniel Bünzli announced:

The current cmdliner manual doc language is broken beyond hope. The next release
is going to fix that which may break the rendering of some manpages [1]. Your
feedback on the changes and new language definition is welcome:

<https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/blob/08be600c4b7f00c08339f078a88b30234d84fc44/CHANGES.md#doc-language-sanitization>
<https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/blob/master/src/cmdliner.mli#L755-L768>

Discussion can happen here:

<https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/issues/68>

Best, 

Daniel

[1] I suspect most will not. But if: 

 git grep '\$([ib],[^)]*\$([mt]name)[^)]*)' 

exits with 0 in your project you are affected for sure. Simply replace these
marked up $(b,$(tname)) and $(b,$(mname)) by the variables $(tname) and $(mname)
themselves.

4) omake-0.10.2
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-02/msg00002.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Gerd Stolpmann announced:

it is my pleasure to announce omake-0.10.2. This is mainly a bug fix
release:

 - fixing build of omake on bytecode-only system
 - (again) fixing "rm -rf" on Windows
 - omake defaults now to the C compiler used by OCaml
 - building the omake documentation is now optional
   (even if hevea is installed - could be non-working)
 - fix inotify on Linux (for omake -P). Note that it is
   still not working on Mac.
 - fix recognizing case-insensitive filesystems on Mac
 - fix the OCamlPackage macro when a pack is created
   and no pack-level mli file is present
 - omake now ignores the env vars PREFIX, BINDIR and
   LIBDIR at install time

The new homepage is now
<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html>.
See there for all the other links. The opam package will be updated
soon.

The old homepage omake.metaprl.org is no longer updated (I don't have
access, and don't know how to take it down).
      
========================================================================
5) cppo, ocamlbuild, and dependencies

Yes, the cppo ocamlbuild plugin
  <https://github.com/mjambon/cppo/blob/master/ocamlbuild_plugin/ocamlbuild_cppo.ml>
does not currently perform any kind of dynamic dependency computation.

I think the best way for this to be implemented would be at the level
of cppo, have a kind of -list-includes flag that would run on a
.cppo.* file and return the list of includes. Then you could easily
change the cppo rule to call this first, dynamically build all these
dependencies, and proceed with normal cppo processing. (I believe this
is roughly how `gcc -M` works.)

In the meantime, I implemented an amusing hack at the ocamlbuild level
which is to simply parse the failure message and, if it complains
about a missing file, recursively build that file as a dynamic
dependency. It seems to work.

(The code below is just a change over the main function of cppo's
ocamlbuild plugin. To use it in your program, copy the cppo's
ocamlbuild source in your myocamlbuild.ml, replace the relevant
function, and at the end add "let () = dispatch dispatcher" or
whatever dispatch logic you wish.)

let cppo_rules ext =
  let dep   = "%(name).cppo"-.-ext
  and prod1 = "%(name: <*> and not <*.cppo>)"-.-ext
  and prod2 = "%(name: <**/*> and not <**/*.cppo>)"-.-ext in
  let cppo_rule prod env build =
    let dep = env dep in
    let prod = env prod in
    let tags = tags_of_pathname prod ++ "cppo" in
    let cppo = S[A "cppo"; T tags; S [A "-o"; Px prod]; P dep] in
    let rec retry tmp =
      let cppo_to_tmp = S[cppo; Sh "2>"; P tmp ] in
      let cppo_cmd = Command.to_string (Cmd cppo_to_tmp) in
      match Sys.command cppo_cmd with
      | 0 -> Nop
      | _ ->
        let cppo_result = read_file tmp in
        let error = Str.regexp
            {|Error: Cannot find included file "\([^"]*\)"|} in
        (* If we cannot find the dependency,
           or if building the dependency fails,
           we return the original cppo command.

           This will do a bit of useless work but give a better error
           message than having the rule raise an exception here, as it
           will present the failure in terms of the cppo error message
           the user knows about, instead of backtracking in other
           rules. *)
        match Str.search_forward error cppo_result 0 with
        | exception Not_found -> Cmd cppo
        | _pos ->
          let dep = Str.matched_group 1 cppo_result in
          match build [[dep]] with
          | [Outcome.Good _dep] -> retry tmp
          | _ -> Cmd cppo
    in
    with_temp_file "ocamlbuild_cppo" "stderr" retry
  in
  rule ("cppo: *.cppo."-.-ext^" -> *."-.-ext)
    ~dep ~prod:prod1 (cppo_rule prod1);
  rule ("cppo: **/*.cppo."-.-ext^" -> **/*."-.-ext)
    ~dep ~prod:prod2 (cppo_rule prod2)

Yes, of course, your approach would also work
(`Ocamlbuild_plugin.read_file` is you friend, followed by the parsing
technique of your choice). The only issue is that you may
over-approximate dependencies depending on how closely you approximate
cppo's grammar (and I don't know, maybe there is a way to have
computed inclusion instead of just file path literals?), so this logic
would be easier to implement correctly in cppo itself.

You may find inspiration in the part of the manual that describes how
to write rules with dynamic dependencies (the explained example is the
code of the (.itarget -> .otarget) rule):

For search by type signature you can use Jun Furuse's OCamlOScope:

<https://camlspotter.github.io/ocamloscope.html>

It also gives documentation when available.

I'm not sure how big the database is.
      
** Daniel Bünzli asked and Hendrik Boom replied:

Search on parts of the type, even.  It is very useful to find all the 
functions that do anything with values of a particular type in order 
to find out what you can do with it.  As well as how you can produce 
values of that type.
      
** Ivan Gotovchits replied:

Yep, the same as it is done in Coq's search command, where you query all
functions that produce integer

Search (_ -> int)

It is extremely useful in Coq, and should be as well in OCaml. 

For example, when I see, that a function requires a value of type `Uuidm.t`,
then a search for `_ -> Uuidm.t` will reveal all possible ways to create it. (Of
course, I can just go to the mli file, and read it, but this defeats the whole
purpose of searching).
      
** Daniel Bünzli also replied and Ivan Gotovchits said:

> Sure but boolean queries on type identifiers seems enough for this. Of course

That's why the search should be up-to some isomorphism, e.g., 

int -> float -> bool

is isomoprhic to

float -> int -> bool

The seach should also work correctly with lots of aliases, since it is usual
when the same type or value in OCaml has mutliple names. The seach should also
ignore parameter names, as this is not what a user can know in advance.
      
** Ivan Gotovchits then added:

This is a link [1] to the underlying theory of type isomorphism search, for
those who are interested:

Well yes, the theory is not required, but it is better to know one :) I provided
a link mostly because it is a sort of a homepage for type-isomorphic search.
There are links to the CamlLight implementations (yeah the idea was there for
some time) and Haskel. Speaking of modern implementations, Argot [1] is the only
example that comes to mind. It has the isomorphic search and a type manifest
search. The search is implemented mostly in Javascript (generated from OCaml).
(Probably, you heard the story that it is broken and abandoned, and yadda
yadda...)

The digest of the theory, is that we have the following rules:

1. a -> b -> c ~ b -> a -> c
2. a * b -> c ~ a -> b -> c
3. unit -> a ~ a

And by applying these rules recursively we can build a set of types that are
isomorphic to the query (or partition all the types into the isomoprhism
groups).

[1]: <http://ocaml.github.io/platform-dev/packages/argot/>
      
** Frédéric Bour then added:

The experimental version of Merlin implements a similar feature (however it
looks only in loaded packages, not the whole opam universe).

It is based on names (normalizing type constructors to resolve aliases), and
uses variance information (types occurring in positive and negative positions)
to guide the search.

The prototype query language looks like "-int +string" for "string of int". You
can see a demo here: <http://alfred.lakaban.net/~def/polarity.webm> .
