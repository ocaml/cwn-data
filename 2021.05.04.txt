Continuing the thread from last week, Fabrice Le Fessant announced
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  I should add that the project is now available in the opam-repository,
  see [solidity-parser] and [solidity-typechecker].

Release of ocaml-pandoc 0.1.0

Samuel Mimram announced
───────────────────────

  I have just released [ocaml-pandoc], a native OCaml library to write
  filters for [pandoc], which is a markdown-to-anything converter. It
  has allowed me to write some simple filters I needed (such as for
  including code snippets, which is not supported natively).

  The support is not complete yet however, I might add more if needed
  (and pull-requests are of course accepted :slight_smile:).

  You want to compare the main core functions found in the OCaml Stdlib
  (v4.12.0), Containers (v3.3), Batteries (v3.3.0) and Base (v0.14.1)
  libraries ?

  Check it out !

  Someone reading this might be also interested in my (less formal)
  comparison between OCaml Stdlib and Base:

  [Comby] may also be of interest, it's a similar project also written
  in OCaml.
