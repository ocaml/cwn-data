I've updated the godi package for wyrd to version 1.4.1. 
Wyrd is a curses-based front-end to remind.  The home page is here:

I've had a look at chapter 12 of the O'Rielly book as well as the 
wrapper for ocaml-fftw3 and cairo-ocaml and it all seems a little 
daunting. 

I was wondering if there was any semi-automated too for creating 
Ocaml bindings for C libraries. 

Any pointers appreciated.
			</pre><i>Chris King answered:</i><br /><pre>
I recently discovered that SWIG (<a href="http://www.swig.org/">http://www.swig.org/</a>) supports O'Caml 
(though I haven't yet used it myself).  If you're looking for speed 
though it may not be the best choice since all C types are mapped to 
one variant type in O'Caml.  You can find O'Caml-specific docs here: 
<a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Ocaml.html">http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Ocaml.html</a> 
I presume you're looking to wrap libsndfile...  I've wrapped a few 
similar libraries manually with very few problems.  The libsndfile API 
looks to me like it should be fairly straightforward to wrap thanks to 
O'Caml's Bigarrays (plus you'll have lots of cut &amp; paste). 

Start by writing a few simple integer, string, or array functions for 
O'Caml in C to get a feel for the API without having to worry about 
custom blocks and such.  The curses wrapper in chapter 18 of the 
O'Caml manual is also a very good starting point.  The custom block 
from that example can be used nearly verbatim for many C structures 
(such as SNDFILE *).  I can provide you with the source of a couple 
other small wrappers if you like.

Obviously there are some semi-automated ways, such as SWIG and camlidl 
mentioned already.  But I would definitely urge you to look at doing 
the wrapping by hand.  It's really not that hard, although you should 
pay careful attention to ch18 of the manual.

			</pre><i>Daniel Bünzli added:</i><br /><pre>
Another way is to meta program the bindings using C macros,   
especially if many stubs have the same structure, have a look at the   
file ml_gl.h in lablgl [1].

I'm working on a SAT solver in OCaml.  The solver has various types, 
like three-valued bools, variables, literals.  I have modules that 
encapsulate these types and the operations on them. 

Now, as it turns out, all these types are represented as ints, but the 
other modules that use those types don't need to know that - and as a 
matter of taste I'd rather not expose this. 

The signatures of these modules currently contain lines like this: 

type variable (* = int *) 

If I uncomment all instances of (* = int *) and reveal the 
representation to the compiler then I get a ... 36% performance 
improvement in the SAT solver. 

I have two questions: 

1/ Is there some way I can reveal this representation to the parts of 
the system that clearly need it for effective optimization, without 
opening this up for general use. 

2/ Failing that, has someone got a pleasant method of doing conditional 
compilation so that I can switch these comments on and off with ease? 

I'm using version 3.09.2 of ocamlopt.

<a href="http://martin.jambon.free.fr/opaque/Opaque.html">http://martin.jambon.free.fr/opaque/Opaque.html</a> seem to be what you're
looking for in the particular case of ints.
			</pre><i>Philippe Wang suggested:</i><br /><pre>
I saw once that there were a lot of optimizations based on types 
informations, especially on basic types... So hidding some type 
information would lead to prevent the compiler from some optimization... 

Well, I wonder about how to hide the information from the users without 
hiding it to the type checker... 

Typically the function compare (or other comparison operators) have to 
check the kinds of their arguments, except when the compiler knows that 
their types are basic types... 

Well, I guess you use a lot the function compare ? 

Have you tried to force the polymorphic functions' types that are only 
used with integers with the type int ? 
(to take back the performance, you will have to tell explicitely the 
compiler to optimise them... or change the compiler code... I guess.)
			</pre><i>Eric Cooper suggested and Jon Harrop answered:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; You can use 
&gt;   type variable = Variable of int 
&gt;   etc. 
&gt; in your signatures. 
&gt; This makes the representation visible for optimization purposes, 
&gt; incurs no representation overhead, 

In OCaml, that imposes a huge representation overhead.
			</pre><i>Andrej Bauer suggested:</i><br /><pre>
You can use multiple signatures and modules to combine things just the 
way you want them. For example, you could have modules and signatures 
organized as follows (I made up some types which don't really make sense 
for SAT): 
(** The SAT module as seen from the outside. *) 
module type SAT = 
sig 
   module Solver : 
   sig 
     type variable (* abstract *) 
     type problem  (* abstract *) 
     type solution = (variable * bool) list 
     val solve : problem -&gt; solution 
   end 

   module SomethingUseful : sig ... end 
end 

module Sat : SAT = 
struct 
   (* inside SAT all types are concrete *) 

   type variable = int 
   type problem = (variable * variable * variable) array 
   type solution = (variable * bool) list 

   module SatHelper = 
   struct 
     (* here is a helper module which is not even seen from outside *) 
     (* it can rely on internal representation *) 
     let internal_solve = ... 
   end 

   (* The module Solver is exported, we put in it exactly what we want 
       the user to see. *) 
   module Solver = 
   struct 
     type variable = variable 
     type problem = problem 
     type solution = solution 
     let solve = SatHelper.internal_solve 
   end 

   module SomethingUseful = struct ... end 
end 

My point is that by nesting modules and exposing just the right amount 
of their interfaces through several different signatures, you can 
control precisely what is seen from where. There is no need to always 
realy on the simplistic view 

   module    = .ml file 
   signature = .mli file 

which is just a convenient shortcut that works in simple examples. 

Best regards, 

Andrej 

P.S. The example above makes it look as if you have to stick everything 
inside one huge file. That's not true, as you can use "include", as well 
as type sharing constraints ("with type1 = type2") to expose certain 
types between modules.
			</pre><i>Nicolas Pouillard also answered:</i><br /><pre>
I take the second part of your question since the obvious answer is camlp4: 
There is an extension called pa_macro that provides conditional compilation. 

Alas this extension doesn't work with signatures so the following 
example is not (yet) supported: 

(* foo.mli *) 
IFDEF ABSTRACT THEN 
type t 
ELSE 
type t = int 
ENDIF 

To address that shortcoming you can write an extension syntax dealing 
with some semi-opaque types. Such an extension can allow us to write 
that: 

(* foo.mli *) 
type t = semi opaque int 

And have compilation option to set: 

# For an abstract version 
$ ocamlc -c -pp "camlp4o ./pa_opaque.cmo -abstract" foo.mli 

# For a concrete version 
$ ocamlc -c -pp "camlp4o ./pa_opaque.cmo -concrete" foo.mli 

With this extension: 

-----------8&lt;----------------------------------------------------------
(* pa_opaque.ml *) 
open Pcaml;; 
let abstract = ref true;; 
EXTEND 
ctyp: [[ LIDENT "semi"; LIDENT "opaque"; t = SELF -&gt; 
  if !abstract then &lt;:ctyp&lt; 'abstract &gt;&gt; else t 
]]; 
END;; 

Pcaml.add_option "-abstract" (Arg.Set abstract) 
  "Use abstract types for semi opaque ones";; 
Pcaml.add_option "-concrete" (Arg.Clear abstract) 
  "Use concrete types for semi opaque ones";; 
-----------8&lt;----------------------------------------------------------

Compiled that way: 

$ ocamlc -c -I +camlp4 -pp "camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo" pa_opaque.ml

you can find new versions of (0.96, 1.00, 0.4 respectively): 
CPU load monitor 
Microsoft command line utilities helper 
Window Maker like dock utility 

APC was ported to Linux/PPC 

IMT was adjusted to work better with path names with spaces in them 

IceDock finally works correctly on systems with LSB images. 
The bug was in excellent XLib by Fabrice Le Fessant and was there 
forever as far as i can see. XLib was also slightly adjusted so 
that newer OCaml compilers produce less warning messages.

Just to announce the first release of ocaml-dbus, version 0.01. 
This is an alpha release (few memory leaks, missing some proper finalize 
function, and maybe segfault lurking), and the library is quite big so 
not everything is wrapped. 

However it should works for basic use, and the test program should be 
enough to get to know how to use it.
