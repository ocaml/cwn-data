  Found on *Lobste.rs*: Mark Karpov writes yet another [Haskell
  vs. OCaml] for old time's sake. I found it worth a read and a mention
  here.

  p.s. He spends a bit of time in the intro lamenting the lack of a
  conventional Unicode string library for OCaml, and I feel that pain
  acutely, especially since I'm the author of an *unconventional* one,
  i.e. the [Ucs_text] module in my [Orsetto] project.
