automated theorem proving, in which all the major techniques that are
described are also implemented as concrete OCaml code:

We've just released the first version of the 'official' OCaml autoconf
macros.  Now there is a central place to collect autoconf macros
related to detecting OCaml, OCaml tools and OCaml libraries.
Everything has been relicensed under a simple 3-clause BSD license (or
rewritten).

I also wrote something about how to get started with OCaml &amp; autoconf:

&gt; I have built a MacOS-to-Linux cross-compiler last week.
&gt; I do confirm that the hard part is getting a cross-[g]cc up and running.
&gt; In fact, this is so tedious that I strongly encourage to resort to either
&gt; a prepackaged cross-[g]cc (from binaries, from a Linux packaging
&gt; system, whatever), or to the excellent "crosstool" available at :
&gt; 	<a href="http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/">http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/</a>
&gt; 
&gt; On the OCaml side, there are very few things to do and they are
&gt; quite straightforward. First, you have to emulate the behaviour of
&gt; "./configure" by producing "config/m.h", "config/s.h", and "config/Makefile"
&gt; by hand. This is easier than it may sound, just start from "config/m-templ.h",
&gt; "config/s-temp.h", and "config/Makefile-templ" (these are comprehensively
&gt; commented).
&gt; Then, you will have to slightly patch some Makefiles, and you are done.
&gt; 
&gt; I will setup a webpage with all the necessary steps and patches as soon
&gt; as I get my notes organized. This will allow us to share knowledge on the subject.

The build process I followed along with its accompagnying patch are
available on the Gallium wiki at the following URL:
	<a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/CrossCompiler">http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/CrossCompiler</a>

This is clearly a very experimental draft that is still a bit hackish.
All reports, both positive and negative are hence very welcome,
in order to polish it up.

MyLife, a people search engine, is seeking an engineer to join a back-end
software development team in Mountain View, California.  The primary
requirements for this position are:

- proficiency in the OCaml programming language -- as most of the team's
software is written in OCaml

- proficiency in written English -- as much of our team communications (design
brainstorms, bug reports, etc.) are written

- proficiency with Linux and shell scripting, build tools, and source control
tools


The ideal candidate will have a good nose for hunting bugs, diagnosing
performance problems, and reading colleagues' code.

MyLife offers an informal work environment, and an opportunity to work on
challenging engineering problems and information-retrieval algorithms over
vast data, with high-impact on end-user experience. Our team was formed at
Wink (acquired by MyLife this past summer) and includes contributors that are
active in the OCaml community.  If you're interested in applying for this
position, please contact the hiring manager at ocaml-job@mylife.com.

I'm happy to announce the first public release of OSpec, an RSpec-inspired
Behavior-Driven Development library for OCaml using a Camlp4 syntax
extension. You can download this release from the ocamlcore forge at

 <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ospec/">http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ospec/</a>

or directly clone the repository from Github:

 <a href="http://github.com/andrenth/ospec/tree/master">http://github.com/andrenth/ospec/tree/master</a>


Here's a simple example of OSpec's syntax:

 describe "An even number" do
   it "should be divisible by two" do
     let divisible_by_two x = x mod 2 = 0 in
     42 should be divisible_by_two
   done;

   (* or simply: *)
   it "should be divisible by two" do
     (42 mod 2) should = 0
   done
 done

OSpec also supports before/after blocks, helper functions to aid in
specification writing, two different report formats and an extension
to the "match" syntax so tha you can use it in your expectations.
Please refer to the README file for details.

After numerous sleepless nights, the OCaml Batteries Included team is
happy to inform you of the release of version Beta 1. Barring any
bugfix, this release should mark API and syntax freeze.

You may download the source tarball from the Forge [1], read the on-line
API documentation [2] or the extended release notes [3].

Thanks to all the members of the team. We're waiting for your feedback
and bug reports!

Cheers,
David
