      <cwn_what>
a couple of installation problems slipped into findlib-1.9, mostly
missing files in the release tarball, but also a FreeBSD
incompatibility. For that reason, there is now findlib-1.9.1 fixing the
problems (so far known, and I hope we caught them all).

      <cwn_title>Conformist 0.2.1</cwn_title>

I am happy to announce the release of conformist 0.2.1.

[Conformist](https://github.com/oxidizing/conformist) deals with schema definition and validation. It supports
decoding to bridge the gap between runtime types and static types without ppx.

#+begin_src ocaml
type occupation =
  | Mathematician
  | Engineer

type user =
  { occupation : occupation
  ; email : string
  ; birthday : int * int * int
  ; nr_of_siblings : int
  ; comment : string option
  ; wants_premium : bool
  }

let user occupation email birthday nr_of_siblings comment wants_premium =
  { occupation; email; birthday; nr_of_siblings; comment; wants_premium }
;;

let occupation_decoder = function
  | "mathematician" -> Ok Mathematician
  | "engineer" -> Ok Engineer
  | _ -> Error "Unknown occupation provided"
;;

let occupation_encoder = function
  | Mathematician -> "mathematician"
  | Engineer -> "engineer"
;;

let user_schema =
  Conformist.(
    make
      Field.
        [ custom
            occupation_decoder
            occupation_encoder
            "occupation"
            ~meta:()
        ; string "email"
        ; date "birthday"
        ; int ~default:0 "nr_of_siblings"
        ; optional (string "comment")
        ; bool "wants_premium"
        ]
      user)
;;

  let input =
    [ "occupation", [ "engineer" ]
    ; "email", [ "test@example.com" ]
    ; "birthday", [ "2020-12-01" ]
    ; "nr_of_siblings", [ "3" ]
    ; "comment", [ "hello" ]
    ; "wants_premium", [ "true" ]
    ]

let user =
  Conformist.decode Schema.user_schema input

let validation_errors =
  Conformist.validate Schema.user_schema input
#+end_src

The ~user_schema~ and the ~user~ create function are guaranteed to be in sync at compile time.

      <cwn_title>Annoucement of OFLAT, a web-based platform to support courses on Formal Languages and Automata Theory</cwn_title>

To support studentsâ€™ autonomous work on topics related with Formal
Languages and Automata Theory (FLAT), interactive tools that allow them
to experiment with examples and solve exercises are very important -
several studies demonstrate this.

There are applications with this aim. While some are impressively
complete, but are mainly Desktop applications (like JFLAP), others that
can be used via a web browser are under-developed. Moreover, these
applications are often not fully interactive - illustrations or even
step-by-step execution is key to understand the algorithms - and, due to
the programming languages used, implement the concepts in a way quite
distant from the textbook Mathematical definitions. Code that implements
closely the definitions is also a relevant pedagogical tool.

With three concerns in mind - availability in mobile devices,
interactive run of the algorithms (or at least presenting clear
explanations), and code following closely the definitions - we developed
OFLAT, a web-based tool to represent and illustrate graphically
classical mechanisms and algorithms of Formal Languages and Automata
Theory. It includes not only exercises evaluated automatically and
providing feedback, but also allows students to create their own
exercises. An integration with a grading platform like Learn-OCaml is
underway.

The tool is implemented in OCaml and is organised in two parts: a
library - OCamlFLAT - which concentrates the logic of FLAT concepts, and
the interactive applicational part - OFLAT. To run on browsers, the
application uses the OCaml to Javascript translator Js_of_OCaml. To
implement the interactive graphics, it uses Cytoscape, a Javascript
library for graphs. All code is available in the Git of the project:
https://gitlab.com/releaselab/leaf/OCamlFlat, https://gitlab.com/releaselab/leaf/OFLAT.

The development of new functionalities is ongoing (we're now working
more animations and on Context-Free Grammar and Pushdown Automata).
Comments most welcome.
