* iostream 0.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-iostream-0-1/12922/1

** Simon Cruanes announced


I've just released iostream 0.1. iostream is a [[https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-iostream][library]] that provides
composable abstractions for input/output streams of bytes. Here composability means that users can create their own
streams, which makes a ~Iostream.Out.t~ more powerful than the standard ~out_channel~ because it is an abstraction
that might perform compression before writing to a ~Buffer.t~, or writes to a socket, or write nowhere, or send the
bytes to multiple other outputs.

There already exist some similar abstractions in the ecosystem, such as Batteries' ~BatIO~, an object based version
of this in ocamlnet, and probably uncountably many other projects. I have ancestor versions of this in many of my
own projects. This is my way of dealing with my failure to implement [[https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/pull/19][RFC19]]
in OCaml itself (a worthy read about tradeoffs and use cases, for anyone interested). In other languages you can
find Rust's [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html][Read]],
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html][BufRead]], and
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html][Write]] traits; and Go's [[https://pkg.go.dev/io#Reader][Reader]]
and [[https://pkg.go.dev/io#Writer][Writer]] interfaces.

A design note: in ~iostream~ there is a separation between ~Iostream.In.t~ (which is basically like a unix FD or
rust's ~Read~: it gives you ~read: bytes -> int -> int -> int~), and ~Iostream.In_buf.t~ (the equivalent of rust's
~BufRead~: it has its own buffer and gives you access to it. Unlike ~in_channel~'s magic methods for ~input_line~,
you can inspect the buffer to look ahead and consume exactly the amount of input you need, no leftovers).

The library is under the MIT license. The online docs are
[[https://c-cube.github.io/ocaml-iostream/dev/iostream/index.html][here]].
      

** Rudi Grinberg asked


Looks like an interesting library to me. I have a few comments or questions:

1. Is there going to be support for bigarrays or do you not support them on purpose?
2. The documentation states that ~close~ "must be idempotent" for output streams and is "idempotent" for input streams. Could you clarify the distinction here? Also, did you consider just making sure that your modules never call these functions more than once? Seems like that would be more helpful to users of the library.
3. Did you consider splitting the parts that depend on Unix into a sub library?
      

** Simon Cruanes replied


These are good questions, thanks. It's not easy to write interfaces with such a general purpose scope :sweat_smile:

1. I didn't see a good way to support both bytes and bigarrays in the same interface ­— asking implementors to have both ~read~ and ~read_bigstring~ would be annoying, for example. However a good chunk of the ecosystem does rely on bigarrays so it is an important topic. I can imagine two solutions on the top of my head:
   * have ~read_bigstring~, ~write_bigstring~ with default implementations just going through an intermediate layer of ~bytes~, and the possibility for the implementor of the stream to write a custom version
   * parametrize the stream types with the underlying type, i.e have ~bytes Iostream.In.t~ as well as ~bigstring ~Iostream.In.t~. But here the difficulty is that all the convenience combinators in the library become impossible to write, or specialized just for (say)  the ~bytes~ version.
2. ~close~ should be idempotent for both, i.e closing twice shouldn't fail. The reason is that it's just too hard to keep track of whether you closed already, especially if you mix explicit closing (closing a connection) with resource handlers such as ~with_in : …~ or ~Fun.protect~ that will ensure proper disposal of resources.
3. How do you provide an interface with a ~as_fd : unit -> Unix.file_descr option~ in a sub-library? It has to be part of the core interface, or not be there at all. This part comes from the initial goal, in RFC 19, to replace standard channels (which provide things like ~seek~ and ~pos~), but I agree it's annoying to depend on ~Unix~.
      



* Second release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/second-release-candidate-for-ocaml-5-1-0/12928/1

** octachron announced


In the last two weeks, two significant bugs have been discovered in the release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0 (one
affecting the type system, another in the runtime).

Those bugs are now fixed and we are publishing a second release candidate to check that everything is in order
before the release in the upcoming week.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][OCaml's issue tracker]].

The full change log for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes][on GitHub]].
A short summary of the two fixed bugs in this release candidate is also available below.

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc2
#+end_src

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-rc2.tar.gz][GitHub]]
- [[https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~rc2.tar.gz][OCaml archives at Inria]]

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc2+options <option_list>
#+end_src
where ~<option_list>~ is a comma-separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a ~flambda~ and
~no-flat-float-array~ switch:
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc2+options ocaml-option-flambda
ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_src

All available options can be listed with ~opam search ocaml-option~.

*** Last Minute Bug Fixes

**** Type System:

- (*breaking change*) [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/6941][#6941]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11187][#11187]], +[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12483][#12483]]: prohibit using classes through recursive modules inheriting or including a class belonging to a mutually-recursive module would previous behave incorrectly, and now results in a clean error. (Leo White, review by Gabriel Scherer and Florian Angeletti)

**** Runtime

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12481][#12481]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/12505][#12505]]: Fix incorrect initialization of array expressions ~[|e1;...;eN|]~ when ~N~ is large enough to require major heap allocation. (Xavier Leroy, report by Andrey Popp, analysis by KC Sivaramakrishnan and Vincent Laviron, review by Gabriel Scherer)
      



* ocamlgraph 2.1.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocamlgraph-2-1-0/12937/1

** Jean Christophe Filliatre announced


It is my pleasure to announce a new release of [[https://github.com/backtracking/ocamlgraph][OCamlGraph]], a graph
library for OCaml. It is already available in opam and it is documented
[[http://backtracking.github.io/ocamlgraph/][here]].

Among other things, this release fixes an embarrassing bug in functions ~Dfs.fold~ and ~Dfs.fold_component~, which
were actually not implementing a depth-first traversal (yet a graph traversal). See the excellent post [[https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/12/17/stack-based-graph-traversal.html][Stack-based
DFS is tricky to get right]] for an
explanation.

Note: We have deprecated the support of package ~ocamlgraph_gtk~, a tool to display graphs using GTK. If you are
using this package, please [[https://github.com/backtracking/ocamlgraph/issues][make an issue]] and we'll discuss the
options.
      



* Liquid ML - A templating language used by Shopify, Github Pages and more!

** Ben Faerber announced


Hello everyone, I am excited to announce the release of my first OPAM package liquid_ml. Shopify's Liquid
Templating language for OCaml. Check it out here:
[[https://github.com/benfaerber/liquid-ml][https://github.com/benfaerber/liquid-ml]]

Learn Liquid syntax here: [[https://shopify.github.io/liquid/][https://shopify.github.io/liquid/]]

The Liquid templating language is used all over including Shopify and Github pages. The Rust port of the language
is very popular for static site and documentation generation. If anyone has any suggestions or wants to help
improve the project I welcome pull requests!
      



* moonpool 0.4
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-4/12941/1

** Simon Cruanes announced


Moonpool [[https://github.com/c-cube/moonpool/releases/tag/v0.4][0.4]] was released on opam a few days ago.

There are not a lot of new features, but Moonpool is now a better citizen wrt resource usage: if no pool is active,
background domains will shut down (to be spun back again later if they're needed). This was trickier to get right
than I expected and a last bug was found [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/24306][during the release
process]] and fixed with the help of @avsm, @dra27 and [[https://github.com/mtelvers][Mark
Telvers]]).
      



* Oxidizing OCaml, and a new opam switch
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/oxidizing-ocaml-and-a-new-opam-switch/12942/1

** Yaron Minsky announced


We just posted the thrilling conclusion to our blog trilogy on Oxidizing OCaml, which talks about some of the
things we've been working on (and some of our space-age plans) around extending OCaml to support some of the same
kinds of things that Rust lets you do, but in a distinctly OCaml-ish way.

Here are the posts:

- [[https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-locality/][Locality]]
- [[https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-ownership/][Rust Style Ownership]]
- [[https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-parallelism/][Data Race Freedom]]

Maybe more excitingly, you can play around with the version of our internal compiler that has the bits of this
we've implemented thus far (mostly, the local/global stuff, but the beginnings of uniqueness as well) as well as
our open-source libraries, via an [[https://github.com/janestreet/opam-repository/tree/with-extensions][opam
switch]].

This is very much a bleeding-edge, unstable version. We use it internally for real work, but we refactor it
mercilessly, and the language features are most definitely not stable. We hope one day to propose a lot of this
upstream, but for now, it's just a preview of some interesting experiments.

The thing I'm most excited about all of this is the prospect of data-race free OCaml. The ability to leverage the
great work done by the Multicore team, but safely, is a prospect I'm very much looking forward to.

Also, a bunch of Jane Street compiler folk will be at ICFP next week. If you're interested in learning more, that's
a good time to grab one of us.
      



* Outreachy December 2023
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/outreachy-december-2023/12949/1

** Patrick Ferris announced


With the conclusion of the previous Outreachy round (see
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/end-of-internship-demo-session/12927/), the next round is fast approaching and the
OCaml community has signed up again to participate!

The deadline for mentors to [[https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/][signup]] is *September 29 2023*. The
OCaml community has decided to try a slightly different approach that has worked very well in the previous round.
We noticed quite a few people would like to be involved in an internship but without worrying too much about the
details of Outreachy itself. If people are simply interested in mentoring and they maintain an open-source project,
then they can reach out directly to @pitag or myself and we can help scope a project, explain the contribution
period and provide as much other help as we can!

When signing up mentors propose an open-source project where prospective interns submit PRs during the
"contribution phases" as part of their application. Mentors will then choose an intern to work with for 3 months. A
more detailed explanation is available [[https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#mentor][on the Outreachy mentor section]].

Finally, [[https://tarides.com][Tarides]] and [[https://ocaml-sf.org][OCaml Software Foundation]] have been very
generous so far funding our efforts on the intern side. Since the previous round, Jane Street and Tarides have gone
a step further and have also provided funding for the mentor side! Mentoring does take time, but you get a lot back
from it on different levels and hopefully this financial help can lower the barriers to being a mentor.

As always if you have any general questions or mentoring ideas do comment on this thread or reach out to us
directly.
      



* New release of PPrint (2023830)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-pprint-2023830/12954/1

** François Pottier announced


It is my pleasure to announce a new release of PPrint, the pretty-printing library, with the following additions:

- The new function ~is_empty~ allows testing (in constant time) whether
  a document is empty.
- Documentation: add a warning about the time and space complexity of
  a naive use of ~ifflat~.

The library now requires OCaml 4.03 or newer.
