Posted in the hope to save somebody's time before the new camlp4 
documentation gets out. 

First a word on side effects: I mean those side effects that 
newly loaded modules perform inside camlp4 to register their 
functions in the camlp4 engine. 

In the good old times one simply used assignments for that, for 
instance 
        Pcaml.print_implem := f 
has always been used to install f as printer for a .ml file. 

In the new camlp4 (some of) these side effects are performed not 
by the user but by camlp4 itself. The user only supplies the 
structure. It works the following way: The user defines a 
functor Make that maps some structure to a structure that defines 
the entities that camlp4 should use: 

    module Make (some arg) = struct 
      let important_fun ... 
    end 

The user then uses Make in a functor application with a 
higher-order, registering functor from camlp4: 

   module IgnoreResult = Camlp4.Register.Purpose(Make) 

where Purpose is one of the functors that Camlp4.Register 
provides. On invocation Purpose applies the user supplied Make to 
the right arguments, obtains a structure with important_fun and, 
finally, performs the side effect to register important_fun in 
the right hook. Actually the story is a bit more complicated, 
because the side effects are delayed: First Make is registered as 
a loaded module inside camlp4 together with a function that will 
perform the necessary side effects some time later. See for 
example functor Printer in camlp4/Camlp4/Register.ml line 73. 

In order to install a new camlp4 printer we only have to find the 
right registering functor and apply it to our arguments, put 
everything into some file and compile it into a .cmo. 

To install a new printer I chose Register.Printer, which takes 
two arguments: an identification module and a Make functor with 
my new printer functions inside. 

Here is the complete code: 

  (* identification module *) 
module Id = struct 
    (* name is printed with the -loaded-modules switch *) 
  let name = "Printer HOWTO" 
    (* cvs id's seem to be the preferred version string *) 
  let version = "$Id: howto verion 1 $" 
end 

  (* the real thing containing the real functions *) 
module Make (Syntax : Camlp4.Sig.Syntax) : 
  Camlp4.Sig.Printer with module Ast = Syntax.Ast = 
struct 
  module Ast = Syntax.Ast 

  let opt_string = function 
    | None -> "<None>" 
    | Some s -> s 

  let info ?input_file ?output_file name = 
    Printf.eprintf 
      "printer on %s\n input : %s\n output : %s\n" 
      name 
      (opt_string input_file) 
      (opt_string output_file) 

    (* print_interf shall be called on .mli files *) 
  let print_interf ?input_file ?output_file ast = 
    info ?input_file ?output_file "signature" 

    (* print_implem shall be called on .ml files *) 
  let print_implem ?input_file ?output_file ast = 
    info ?input_file ?output_file "structure" 
end 

  (* apply everything to register the new printer *) 
module M = Camlp4.Register.Printer(Id)(Make) 

(* end of source *) 

Put the source into a file printer.ml and compile with 

   ocamlc -c -I `camlp4 -where` printer.ml 

Use examples: 

    gromit otags 7> camlp4o printer.cmo printer.ml 
    printer on structure 
     input : printer.ml 
     output : <None> 

    gromit otags 8> camlp4o -o output_file printer.cmo printer.ml 
    printer on structure 
     input : printer.ml 
     output : output_file 

    gromit otags 9> ocamlc -pp 'camlp4o printer.cmo' printer.ml 
    printer on structure 
     input : printer.ml 
     output : <None> 

Happy printing, 

Hendrik

Will be

Since 3.10 is not officially out the sooner is the better.

2) OCaml and C code in a dynamic library

i recently make a dynamic library including c++ wrappers to an ocaml 
module, to be loaded as a SCA component by apache tuscany. 
The first problem was that i have a 64b architecture, and in order to 
link against libcamlrun in shared mode, a recompilation of the runtime 
with -fPIC flag was necessary. I called the resulting library 
libcamlrun_shared, to not confuse it with the original one. 
Also you have to initialize the ocaml runtime from whiting you 
library.., and for my best knowledge it is necessary to pass the path 
to you .so to the caml_main function, like: 

#define LIB_DIR "/home/pablo/ocaml/tproject/deploy/TuscanyCalculator" 
  static char *argv[] = { 
    LIB_DIR "/libTuscanyCalculatorImpl.so", 
    LIB_DIR "/libTuscanyCalculatorImpl.so", 
    NULL 
  }; 
  caml_main (argv); 

The way that work for my is to compile the c code with -c -fPIC flags, 
 compile the ocaml modules also with -c , and then link all the object 
codes together with  ocamlc -linkall -custom -cclib "-fPIC -shared 
.. and include the libraries you need ( -lcamlrun_shared  -ltermcap 
in my system) 

I think the best is to look at the makefile of the ocaml module for 
the aol server <http://www.crystalballinc.com/vlad/software/> 

or the apache mod_ocaml 
<http://merjis.com/developers/mod_caml> , a lite more complex makefile. 

also, look at these previous post in this area:

Yes Menhir is reentrant.

COCANWIKI (very recent versions) use OCamlRSS and xml-light.

5) OCaml Summer Project winners selected

** Yaron Minsky announced:

I'm pleased to announce that we've selected a list of winning projects for 
the OCaml Summer Project.  The project has gone well beyond our 
expectations.  Our initial expectation was to fund 5-10 students, but the 
quality of the submissions we saw was so high that we decided to fund 12 
projects for a total of 15 students (three of the projects had two 
participants.) 

We're really excited about this summer, and we hope to see some great 
software come out of it.  For a list of the accepted titles, take a look at 
the project website:

6) [Camlp4 3.10] The rosetta stone

Thanks a lot. 
I backported it to camlp4 3.10.0+beta. Compiling the extension and 
using it to preprocess a sample file now work fine (but I haven't tested 
the correctness of the generated code). 

The few things that didn't want to work with 3.10.0+beta were commented 
out and replaced by workarounds. 

People interested in upgrading their syntax extensions can read the 
side-by-side diffs:

Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'<1':1
zM
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

If you happen to miss a CWN, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@polytechnique.org) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/>) or the RSS feed of the
archives (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/cwn.rss>). If you also wish
