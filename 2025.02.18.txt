Learn Programming with OCaml (new book)

  Dear OCaml community,

  A long time ago, Sylvain and I wrote a French book on [learning
  programming with OCaml].  Recently, the OCaml Software Foundation
  funded its translation to English. The book is available here:

  [Learn Programming with OCaml]

  Many thanks to [Urmila] for a translation of high quality.

  The book is available as a PDF file, under the [CC-BY-SA license]. The
  source code for the various programs contained in the book are
  available for download, under the same license.

  The book is structured in two parts.  The first part is a
  tutorial-like introduction to OCaml through 14 small programs,
  covering many aspects of the language.  The second part focuses on
  fundamental algorithmic concepts, with data structures and algorithms
  implemented in OCaml. This is also a nice way to learn a language!

  The book does not cover all aspects of OCaml.  It is ideally
  complemented by [other books on OCaml].

Ocsigen's 2024 recap
════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocsigens-2024-recap/16117/1>


William Caldwell announced

  Hi all!

  2024 was a busy year for the Ocsigen ecosystem, in case you missed any
  of it, here are the important highlights:

  wasm_of_ocaml has been merged in its parent project js_of_ocaml,
  making your Ocsigen projects that much closer to being served as WASM
  instead of JavaScript. In the meantime you can build your own WASM by
  using wasm_of_ocaml to get a taste of the future.

  Major work has been undertaken on Ocsigen:

  • Ocsigen Server 6
  • Eliom 11
  • Ocsigen Start 7

  Ocsigen server no longer needs a configuration file to start your
  project, you can instead start Ocsigen server in your project and
  handle the configuration yourself.  If you're eager to
  `Ocsigen_server.start ...' you can learn more in the following
  announcements:

  • [ocsigen server 6]
  • [Eliom 11 and Osigen Start 7]

  Ready for 2025? We certainly are!  Our efforts to make the Ocsigen
  ecosystem more modular are ongoing: next on the list is ocsigen-i18n,
  making easier to pick and choose what bits of Ocsigen you want to
  include in your project, and allowing to use it for any OCaml
  application.  The biggest evolution of the Ocsigen project is underway
  & soon to be announced, and that's not even including wasm\_of\_ocaml.
  Also keep an eye out for our public meeting announcements in which we
  discuss our current tasks, ask for public feedback, and answer
  whatever Ocsigen related questions you might have.

OCaml GADTs for Authentication Tokens

  Hi everyone! 👋

  My name is Max, I've been using OCaml for a while during my years at
  Bloomberg and at some moment decided to dig a little bit into GADTs. I
  found couple of use cases for them and decided to write down one in
  detail:

  • [OCaml GADTs for Authentication Tokens]

  I hope it would help newcomers to find application for GADTs in their
  projects.

  Huge thanks to @chshersh for reviewing this blog post!

  Enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!

OCaml language committe launched
════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-language-committe-launched/16129/1>


octachron announced
───────────────────

  It is my pleasure to announce the launch of the OCaml language
  committee. This committee is intended as collegial instance with the
  aim to facilitate discussions and consensus making about the evolution
  of the OCaml language and its standard library.

  Over the years, it has become a common shared grievance among both
  maintainers and contributors to the OCaml language that, sometimes,
  the review process for changes grinds to a halt, either because
  consensus is elusive or because no one feels empowered enough to take
  a decision single-handed.

  In order to reduce the number of those instances of decision
  paralysis, the OCaml maintainers have decided to experiment with an
  OCaml language committee: [a subgroup of the OCaml community]
  organised to discuss evolution of the OCaml language in a timely
  fashion.

  In practice, if someone feels that a contribution (a Pull Request,
  issue, Request For Comment) might be stuck or might benefit from a
  wider discussion, they may ask the committee to take the contribution
  under consideration by mentioning it to the committee chair (which is
  currently me, aka @Octachron on github).

  Then the committee will deliberate on this contribution both on the
  [archived] public mailing list `ocaml-language-committee@inria.fr' for
  internal committee discussion [^1] and possibly on the relevant
  community channels ([ocaml/ocaml] or [here on discuss]). At the end of
  this collegial discussion, the committee will publish a consultative
  decision on the matter. We expect that having such a collegial
  consultative decision would be enough to unblock most situations.

  For more details, the intended working of the committee is described
  at <https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/blob/master/Committee.md> .

  Happy hacking, Florian Angeletti for the OCaml Language Committee

  [^1]: Anyone is welcome to subscribe to the mailing list to attend to
  the discussions, but please do not flood the mailing list so that we
  can keep it fully open.

Asking For Community Feedback on the OCaml Platform Communications
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/asking-for-community-feedback-on-the-ocaml-platform-communications/16142/1>


Sabine Schmaltz announced

  Hi all,

  I'm looking for feedback on the OCaml Platform communications,
  especially the Platform Newsletter and the [OCaml.org] Changelog.

  For this, I have prepared a Google form survey (you can send me your
  responses by email if you prefer):

  <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctTt-WtWEU9heJixGAcAxeUxZhPeX0ioTnaPk6VKTwYHHs9A/viewform>

  The survey aims to improve both the *process* and the *usefulness* of
  the *OCaml Platform communications* and to help me create a handbook
  that gives a clear picture of all our developer-focused communication
  channels, as well as how the *new Developer Advocate role* at Tarides
  can support the maintainers in these communications.

  A major aim of this effort is to *adapt the process* around the
  communications to minimize the amount of friction imposed on engineers
  and to maximize the *usefulness to the readers*.

  Thanks for your help!
