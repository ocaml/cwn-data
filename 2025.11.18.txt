Announcing the first release of Alice, a radical OCaml build system
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/announcing-the-first-release-of-alice-a-radical-ocaml-build-system/17472/1>


Steve Sherratt announced
────────────────────────

  I’m pleased to announce the initial release of [Alice], a radical,
  experimental OCaml build system, package manager, and environment
  manager for [Windows], macOS, and Linux. Its goal is to allow anyone
  to program in OCaml with as little friction as possible.

  To build your first program with Alice, run:
  ┌────
  │ $ alice tools install   # Skip this if you already have an OCaml compiler!
  │ $ alice new hello
  │ $ cd hello
  │ $ alice run
  │  Compiling hello v0.1.0
  │    Running hello/build/packages/hello-0.1.0/debug/executable/hello
  │ 
  │ Hello, World!
  └────

  The UI is heavily inspired by Cargo.

  An important distinction between Alice's and Opam's packaging
  philosophies is that in Alice, _the OCaml compiler and development
  tools are not packages_. The `alice tools install' command will
  install a pre-compiled ([relocatable!]) OCaml compiler, a compatible
  `ocamllsp', and `ocamlformat' user-wide, similar to how `rustup'
  installs the Rust compiler and LSP server. This lets you go from zero
  to OCaml really fast because you don't have to build the compiler from
  source. This speedup is particularly noticeable on Windows where
  building the compiler can take upwards of 10 minutes.

  Alice supports building packages with dependencies on other packages,
  but currently only local packages are supported, and it can only build
  _Alice_ packages, not Opam packages. See an example [here]. I'll
  probably add Opam compatibility in the future.

  It's still early days and [a lot] is missing before Alice could
  feasibly be used for real projects.

  If you want to try it out anyway, install the `alice' Opam package,
  the `github:alicecaml/alice' Nix flake, or run the interactive install
  script:
  ┌────
  │ curl -fsSL https://alicecaml.org/install.sh | sh
  └────
  More details about installing Alice are [here].

First release of ppx_deriving_jsont
═══════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-ppx-deriving-jsont/17478/1>


vds announced
─────────────

  I am happy to announce the first release of [`ppx_deriving_jsont'].

  As the name implies, it is a tool that automates some of the burden
  inherent to writing Jsont descriptions. [Jsont] is a fairly novel
  library for declarative JSON data manipulation, created by @dbuenzli.

  This ppx can manage most of the basic types, tuples, variants and
  records, but still lacks a lot of features and control. It is also
  quite bad at error reporting. The current roadmap, which highlights
  existing and missing features can be found in [the project’s readme]
  along with many examples. I focused on generating readable and
  reusable code, close to the [cookbook] illustrations.

  Note that Jsont offers much finer control and many more features than
  what that you can achieve using this crude ppx. Please take some time
  to read about all of its intricacies:

  • In the official [documentation] and [cookbook]
  • In Daniel’s [introductory post] here on discuss.

  When precision and good error handling are required, such as when
  interacting with external json sources, thoughtfully crafted
  descriptions should still be considered. But I do believe this ppx to
  be very useful for bootstrapping, prototyping or when both the
  encoders and decoders are entirely under the app’s control. I wrote it
  to that intent and already use it in several personal projects. I hope
  you will find it useful too! (and not too non-sensical
  :slightly_smiling_face:)

crypt 2.0 - unix crypt function
═══════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-crypt-2-0-unix-crypt-function/17485/1>


Mikhail announced
─────────────────

  Hi there!

  I'm happy to announce the release of a new major version (i.e., 2.0)
  of the [crypt] library (bindings to the [Unix
  crypt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(Unix)>) function). The
  previous version, 1.3, was outdated, since the last commit was six
  years ago. This version does not support correct compilation on
  various Unix platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS), and uses deprecated
  tools. However, the new version addresses these issues: it supports
  Linux, FreeBSD and macOS, uses modern tools, has safe C stubs,
  provides excellent documentation, and features an idiomatic high-level
  wrapper.


[crypt] <https://github.com/vbmithr/ocaml-crypt>

Installation
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  by OPAM package manager:
  ┌────
  │ $ opam install crypt.2.0  
  └────


Example of usage
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  ┌────
  │ # #require "crypt";;
  │ 
  │ # Crypt.crypt ~salt:"GUBv0xjJ" "hello";;
  │ - : string = "GUpsIDCLVu8AY"
  │ 
  │ # Crypt.crypt ~derivation:Md5 ~salt:"GUBv0xjJ" "hello";;
  │ - : string = "$1$GUBv0xjJ$rQSvX8r6cT7H/NItzzVNQ/"
  └────
  If you don't provide any salt, a new salt will be generated every time
  the function is called.
  ┌────
  │ # Crypt.crypt "hello";;
  │ - : string = "QwD.wi5nLT/0s"
  │ 
  │ # Crypt.crypt "hello";;
  │ - : string = "MYM.5hv5Lk2Mg"
  └────
  But for a deterministic generation, you should use one salt that you
  can generate using the `Crypt.Salt' module or another external module.
  ┌────
  │ # let salt = Crypt.Salt.gen_base64 9;;
  │ val salt : string = "dHiPl3q99"
  │ 
  │ # Crypt.crypt ~salt "hello";;
  │ - : string = "dHDdeFGUWcGyQ"
  └────


P.S.

Joel Reymont announced
──────────────────────

  I wrote [a blog post] about adding command history browsing and
  editing, as well as tab completion, to `ocamldebug', without typing a
  single line of code. I challenge you to review the PR for fun and to
  try to find holes in it!

  I’m going to add DWARF debugging information to OCaml next. I think
  it’s [almost ready to go] but needs double and triple
  checking. Commits look like this

  ┌────
  │ Date:   Thu Nov 13 14:55:24 2025 +0200
  │ 
  │ 
  │ Add DWARF tests for basic functionality
  │ 
  │ Add minimal tests to verify DWARF emission works correctly with -g flag.
  │ Tests compile OCaml programs with debugging enabled and verify correct
  │ execution.
  └────

  and

  ┌────
  │ Date:   Thu Nov 13 14:54:30 2025 +0200
  │ 
  │ Implement DWARF v4 debugging support for OCaml
  │ 
  │ Add complete DWARF version 4 debugging information generation for OCaml
  │ native code. The implementation generates debug info for functions, types,
  │ and line numbers, enabling debugger support for OCaml programs.
  │ 
  │ Key components:
  │ - Low-level DWARF primitives (tags, attributes, forms, encodings)
  │ - Debug Information Entries (DIE) construction
  │ - Line number program generation
  │ - String table management with offset tracking
  │ - Code address tracking and relocation
  │ - Integration with OCaml compilation pipeline
  │ - Configuration flags to enable/disable DWARF emission
  │ 
  │ The implementation follows the DWARF 4 specification and generates
  │ valid debug sections (.debug_info, .debug_line, .debug_str, .debug_abbrev)
  │ that can be consumed by standard debuggers like gdb and lldb.

Moonpool 0.10, and a blogpost about Moonpool at Imandra
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-10-and-a-blogpost-about-moonpool-at-imandra/17493/1>


Simon Cruanes announced
───────────────────────

  Good morning,

  A couple of news about Moonpool. Moonpool is a concurrency and
  parallelism library that provides a `Runner.t' abstraction,
  implemented mostly by thread pools, as a way to run lightweight tasks
  possibly on multiple cores.

  First, I just wrote a blog post about [our use of Moonpool] at
  Imandra. The post discusses our experience with using Moonpool and
  some lessons learned over time.

  Secondly, Moonpool 0.10 was just released. It contains a few bugfixes,
  and removes some deprecated modules. It also removes `moonpool.fib'
  (fibers with structured concurrency) as they have turned out, over the
  years, to be somewhat hard to use properly (they assume the existence
  of a parent fiber, making code highly context-dependent). Lightweight
  thread-safe futures (based on Picos') with per-future local-storage
  are still there and serve mostly the same purpose. The release and
  change notes can be found [here].

libdrm - OCaml bindings for Linux mode setting, etc
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-libdrm-ocaml-bindings-for-linux-mode-setting-etc/17497/1>


Thomas Leonard announced
────────────────────────

  I'm pleased to announce the first release of [libdrm-ocaml] (OCaml
  bindings for the libdrm C library).

  libdrm is used by applications such as Wayland compositors to control
  the physical graphics hardware.

  For example, you can use the library to enumerate graphics devices:

  ┌────
  │ utop # Drm.Device.list ();;
  │ - : Drm.Device.Info.t list =
  │ [{primary_node = Some "/dev/dri/card0";
  │   render_node = Some "/dev/dri/renderD128";
  │   info = PCI {bus = {domain = 0; bus = 1; dev = 0; func = 0};
  │               dev = {vendor_id = 0x1002;
  │                      device_id = 0x67ff;
  │                      subvendor_id = 0x1458;
  │                      subdevice_id = 0x230b;
  │                      revision_id = 0xff}}}]
  │ 
  │ utop # let dev = Unix.openfile "/dev/dri/card0" [O_CLOEXEC; O_RDWR] 0;;
  │ 
  │ utop # Drm.Device.Version.get dev;;
  │ - : Drm.Device.Version.t =
  │ {version = 3.61.0; name = "amdgpu"; date = "0"; desc = "AMD GPU"}
  └────

  Here's an excerpt configuring a hardware plane to present a
  framebuffer on a CRT controller:

  ┌────
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.fb_id } <- Some fb;
  │ (* Source region on frame-buffer: *)
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.src_x } <- Drm.Ufixed.of_int 0;
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.src_y } <- Drm.Ufixed.of_int 0;
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.src_w } <- Drm.Ufixed.of_int (fst size);
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.src_h } <- Drm.Ufixed.of_int (snd size);
  │ (* Destination region on CRTC: *)
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.crtc_x } <- 0;
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.crtc_y } <- 0;
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.crtc_w } <- fst size;
  │ plane.%{ K.Plane.crtc_h } <- snd size;

New release of visitors
═══════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-visitors/17499/1>


François Pottier announced
──────────────────────────

  I am pleased to announce a new release of `visitors', a tool that
  automatically generates visitor classes for algebraic data types.

  The new features of this release are as follows:

  • `visitors' now decorates every generated method with a type
    annotation. This can help understand the generated code. More
    importantly, this enables type-directed disambiguation, so
    `visitors' now supports situations where two distinct types have a
    field or a data constructor by the same name. (Reported by Guillaume
    Boisseau. Contributed by Sacha Élie-Ayoun.)

  • Install a new executable command, `visitors_preprocess', to
    preprocess an OCaml source file and see the result.

  • Update `Makefile.preprocess' to use `visitors_preprocess'.

  • Require `ppxlib' version 0.37.0 or newer.
