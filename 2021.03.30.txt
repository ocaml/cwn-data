Gregory Malecha announced
─────────────────────────

  I lead the formal methods team at Bedrock Systems
  (<https://bedrocksystems.com>) and we are looking to hire a full-time
  engineer working on automation in the Coq proof assistant (which is
  written in Ocaml). We're very interested in candidates with strong
  Ocaml background especially in topics related to automated theorem
  proving, e.g. SAT/SMT solvers, datalog, superposition, resolution,
  etc. While Coq experience is great, you do not need to be a Coq expert
  to apply to this position, we're happy to marry your Ocaml expertise
  with our Coq expertise.

  Formal methods are at the core of BedRock's business and we are deeply
  committed to solving problems of system verification at industrial
  scale. We get FM techniques and insights into the code early on and
  use them to build, maintain, and evolve code. This includes developing
  more agile techniques to keep evolving verified systems once they're
  built.

  We have eight folks on the formal methods team today, hailing from
  MPI-SWS, MIT CSAIL, Princeton, and other leading research groups. If
  you're interested, send me an email or you can inquire more broadly at
  jobs@bedrocksystems.com.

  *Company overview:*

  BedRock is building a *trustworthy compute base for mission-critical
  applications* . The foundation of the platform is an open source,
  multi-core, capability-based micro-hypervisor that we are developing
  and verifying. On top of these deep specifications we are writing and
  verifying applications to provide an extensible and configurable core.

  Our contention is that the *time is ripe for verifiably trustworthy
  systems*, for everything from secure phones and industrial IoT to
  autonomous systems and financial infrastructure. With significant seed
  funding, great investors, and commercial projects underway, we are
  growing our team in Boston, the Bay Area, DC, and Germany.

Tim Mc Gilchrist announced
──────────────────────────

  I'm pleased to announce the release of [ocaml-aws] 1.2.

  ocaml-aws aims to provide generated bindings to many AWS services
  using the botocore specifications. In this version we've bumped
  version bounds on a bunch of depedencies and also added new bindings
  for:
  • RDS
  • Route53
  • SDB
  • SQS

  Please check it out and report any issues.

Release of `fmlib.0.2.0'
════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-fmlib-0-2-0/7527/1>


Hbr announced
─────────────

  I am pleased to announce the second release (0.2.0) of fmlib, a
  functional library with managed effects.

  The library has up to now 4 components:

  • [Some standard datatypes]
  • [Pretty printing functions]
  • [Parsing combinator library]
  • [Primitives to compile to javascript]

  The last component is the new one in version 0.2.0. Internally it uses
  `js_of_ocaml' to compile to javascript. It is an easy to use library
  of primitive functions to access mainly browser functionality from
  ocaml and some rudimentary functions to access nodejs functionality.

  It can be installed via opam by

  ┌────
  │ opam update
  │ opam install fmlib
  │ opam install fmlib_js
  └────

  It is located at [github]


[Some standard datatypes]
<https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib/Fmlib_std/index.html>

[Pretty printing functions]
<https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib/Fmlib_pretty/Print/index.html>

[Parsing combinator library]
<https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib/Fmlib_parse/index.html>

[Primitives to compile to javascript]
<https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_js/index.html>

[github] <https://github.com/hbr/fmlib>


Hbr added
─────────

  Hint: `fmlib' is still a bundle of three libraries i.e. three toplevel
  modules `Fmlib_std', `Fmlib_pretty' and `Fmlib_parse'. Therefore they
  have to be used in a `dune' file with

  ┌────
  │ (libraries fmlib.fmlib_std fmlib.fmlib_pretty fmlib.fmlib_parse ...)
  └────

  while the new library can be used with

  ┌────
  │ (libraries fmlib_js ...)
  └────

  This inconvenience will be corrected in the next release.


soupault: a static website generator based on HTML rewriting
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-soupault-a-static-website-generator-based-on-html-rewriting/4126/14>


Daniil Baturin announced
────────────────────────

  [soupault 2.5.0] offers some features that are unique among SSGs.

  There are two new built-in widgets for rewriting internal links, which
  is useful if you don't host your website at the server root. For
  example, if you host it at `example.com/~user', you cannot just write
  `<img src="/header.png">': it will point to `example.com/header.png'
  while you want `example.com/~user/header.png' instead.

  The `relative_links' widget will convert all internal links to
  relative links according to their depth in the directory tree. For
  example, suppose you have `<img src="/header.png">' in your page
  template. Then in `about/index.html' that link will become `<img
  src="../header.png">'; in `books/magnetic-fields/index.html' it will
  be `<img src="../../header.png">' and so on. This way you can move the
  website to a subdirectory and it will still work.

  The `absolute_links' widget prepends a prefix to every internal
  link. Conceptually similar to the site URL option in other SSGs and
  CMSes, but works for all links, not only links generated by the SSG
  itself.

  I'm happy to announce the release of Timere-parse 0.0.2, the natural
  language parsing component of Timere, a date time handling and
  reasoning library. Both packages are under the [Timere repo].

  Timere-parse allows interpretation of common descriptions of date,
  time and duration.

Release of cohttp 4.0.0
═══════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-cohttp-4-0-0/7537/1>


Marcello Seri announced
───────────────────────

  We are glad to announce the [upcoming release] of [`cohttp 4.0.0'], a
  low-level OCaml library for HTTP clients and servers.

  This release comes with a big update of the documentation and the
  examples, both in the [README] and in the codebase, and improvements
  and bug fixes from many contributors 🙇 which you will find listed
  below.

  A huge thank you to all the people that helped to get this release
  ready by raising issues, participating in discussions, sending PRs,
  and otherwise using our library.

[README] <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp>

The future of cohttp
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  To quote @avsm from [another post]

        The development process […] is driven by a simple
        principle that is inspired by OCaml itself: don't
        needlessly break backwards compatibility without good
        reason, and when it is necessary, justify it. Our tools
        are embedded in projects that have lifespans measured in
        the decades, and we take compatibility seriously. That’s
        why we take pains to provide migration paths […] that are
        as invisible as possible.

  Since in this release we have decided to include a number of fixes and
  improvements which modified Cohttp module signatures, we decided to
  signal the potential breackage by bumping the major version of the
  library. In most cases, however, you don't need to do anything and
  your code will keep working with the latest cohttp.

  Moving forward, we have agreed to start working on the API and the
  internals of cohttp to modernize it and get it ready for multicore
  support and also for eventual unification with the h2 stack that
  offers HTTP2/3 support.

  To be able to move forward and avoid stalling improvements for months,
  we will be less shy of major releases.  However, to remain true to the
  principle above, we will be careful to introduce one breakage at a
  time, carefully justify its need and provide a clear upgrade path in
  the changelog.

  The version history is:
  • cohttp 2.5.5: security backports (changelog below)
  • cohttp 3.0.0: skipped (explained below)
  • cohttp 4.0.0: the next release (changelog below)
  • cohttp 5.0.0: will include a long-awaited change in [how headers are
    treated]: which fixes a multitude of past issues and simplifies the
    internals of the module.

  For the people that need stability, *we have decided to keep
  backporting important security fixes to the `2.5.x' branch of the
  project*. In fact, `cohttp 2.5.5', released just a few days ago was
  the first release with the backport of a security issue.

What happened to 3.0.0?
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The release of `cohttp 3.0.0' has been long awaited, and we are
  extremely grateful to @dinosaure for the enormous work that went into
  designing and implementing `conduit 3.0.0' and `cohttp 3.0.0' (part of
  which remained in `4.0.0' as bug fixes and API improvements).

  However, a discussion started soon after the release pointing out that
  there could be further room of improvement also with the new design,
  particularly with respect to backwards compatibility. Since the design
  discussion did not reach consensus, these changes were reverted to
  preserve better compatibility with existing cohttp users and `cohttp
  3.0.0' was [marked as unavailable] on the opam repository.  As
  maintainers, our "lesson learnt" is to not do releases incrementally
  when they span multiple libraries: we were caught in an awkward spot
  when conduit 3 was released, but without cohttp 3.

  The work on the new conduit is steadily progressing and will be
  integrated in a new major release of cohttp in the future, once we
  will be confident that the API is settled. If you want to try using it
  immediately, then it is available as the [mimic] library in ocaml-git.

[#730] <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/issues/730>


v2.5.5
┄┄┄┄┄┄

  • `Cohttp_async.resolve_local_file', `Cohttp_lwt.resolve_local_file'
    and `Cohttp_lwt_unix.resolve_file' are now the same code under the
    hood (`Cohttp.Path.resolve_local_file'). The old names have been
    preserved for compatibility, but will be marked as deprecated in the
    next release. This changes the behavior of
    `Cohttp_lwt_unix.resolve_file': it now percent-decodes the paths and
    blocks escaping from the docroot correctly. This also fixes and
    tests the corner cases in these methods when the docroot is
    empty. (@ewanmellor #755)

    *Double check your code base for uses of
     `Cohttp_lwt_unix.resolve_file': it is unsafe with respect to path
     handling*. If you cannot upgrade to `cohttp 2.5.5', you should
     modify your code to call `Cohttp_lwt.resolve_local_file' instead.
