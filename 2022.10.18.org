* Routes v2.0.0 released
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-routes-v2-0-0-released/10617/1

** Anurag Soni announced


I’d like to announce release of version 2.0.0 of [[https://github.com/anuragsoni/routes/][routes ]] to the [[https://ocaml.org/p/routes/2.0.0][ocaml
package registry]].

*Routes* provides a DSL for typed bi-directional URI dispatch. It allows writing route definitions that can be
used for both matching, and printing URI paths. The internal representation of the router uses a ~trie~ to perform
route matching.

*** Changes since the last opam release:

**** New updates
- use ~ppx_expect~ for tests.
- A new ~route~ function is available and is an alias for ~@-->~ which is used to connect a route pattern to a "handler".

**** Breaking changes
- Drop support for OCaml 4.05-4.07
- Switch to a new model for trailing slash handling. In routes 1.0.0 users needed to be careful about using ~/?~ and ~//?~ as the former would only match routes without a trailing slash, and the latter would enforce a trailing slash.
  - Users only need to use ~/?~ to end routes, and it will cover both routes ending with trailing slashes and without
  - The type used for representing match results has more information about whether it was an exact match, or if it was a match but the input target had a trailing slash at the end.
  - ~MatchWithTrailingSlash~ informs the user that the current target was considered a match, but that the target has an additional trailing slash

Examples of how to use the library are available in the [[https://github.com/anuragsoni/routes/blob/4af400b3d72e75f87907a04f47598a6580cd9d2f/test/routing_test.ml][tests

* Domainslib 0.5.0 released
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-domainslib-0-5-0-released/10620/1

** Sudha Parimala announced


I'm happy to announce the release of [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/domainslib/domainslib.0.5.0/][Domainslib
0.5.0]].

[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib][Domainslib]] is a parallel programming library for the upcoming OCaml 5. Domainslib provides support for parallel operations such as ~parallel_for~, ~async~/~await~ tasks etc. with an
efficient work-stealing mechanism in its core. Tasks are expressed with effect handlers, enabling efficient nested
parallelism.

You can give it a spin with the [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/awesome-multicore-ocaml#installation][5.0.0~alpha1
compiler]]. For examples of Domainslib
programs, here is a [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml][tutorial on parallel programming with
domainslib]], KC's [[https://github.com/kayceesrk/ocaml5-tutorial][hands on
tutorial]] at the Tarides retreat, and [[https://github.com/Sudha247/ocaml5-tutorial-icfp-22][another
one]] Marek and I did at ICFP 2022.

Submissions of interesting Domainslib benchmarks appreciated at [[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark][sandmark]].
Results of existing ones can be viewed at https://sandmark.tarides.com/ under the parallel benchamrks tab. Please
feel free to add your multicore/effects libraries and experiments to
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/awesome-multicore-ocaml][awesome-multicore-ocaml]].

Changes from the previous release:

-   Bug fix for ~parallel_for_reduce~ on empty loops.
-   Make Chan.t and Task.promise injective [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/69][Make Chan.t and Task.promise injective ocaml-multicore/domainslib#69]]
-   Add lockfree dependency [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/70][remove Ws_deque module ocaml-multicore/domainslib#70]]
-   CI fixes ([[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/73][Add alpha repo to GitHub Actions ocaml-multicore/domainslib#73]], [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/76][Run ~5.0.0~alpha0~ in the CI ocaml-multicore/domainslib#76]])
-   Breaking change: Rename ~num_additional_domains~ to ~num_domains~ for setup_pool
-   Documentation updates ([[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/80][Use ~invalid_arg~ ocaml-multicore/domainslib#80]], [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/81][Document that non-commutative operators are okay ocaml-multicore/domainslib#81]], [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/82][Explain what will happen with an empty pool ocaml-multicore/domainslib#82]])

* OCaml 5.0.0, first beta release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-5-0-0-first-beta-release/10623/1

** octachron announced


The release of OCaml 5.0.0 is drawing near.

After two alpha releases, we have released a first beta version to help you update your softwares and libraries
ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions).
The standard library has been stabilized and many opam packages already work with this release.
If you find any bugs, please report them here:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Compared to the last alpha release, this beta contains many small internal runtime fixes (in particular in the
systhreads library).
At the user level, the interfaces of the Domain and Effect modules have been tweaked to be more forward-compatible:
- Exceptions related to effects are now defined in the Effect module.
- The value ~Domain.recommended_domain_count~ is no longer a constant and the function ~Domain.at_each_spawn~ has been removed.
With those changes, the standard library should be stable now.
The final release of OCaml 5.0.0 is currently expected to be in December.

If you are interested by the ongoing list of bug fixes, the updated change log for OCaml 5.0.0 is available at:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.0/Changes

You can also follow the state of the opam ecosystem on

  https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/21526

and

  http://check.ocamllabs.io/

A short summary of the changes since the last alpha release is also available
below.

*** Installation instructions
The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:
#+begin_src shell
opam update opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1
#+end_src

For previous version of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more verbose:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src

It might be also interesting to check the new support for parallelism by installing
the domainslib library with

#+begin_src shell
opam install domainslib
#+end_src

The source code for the beta release is available at these addresses:

- https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.0.0-beta1.tar.gz
- https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.0/ocaml-5.0.0~beta1.tar.gz

**** Fine-tuned compiler configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options <option_list>
#+end_src
where ~option_list~ is a comma separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a ~flambda~ and
~no-flat-float-array~ switch:
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 5.0.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda
ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_src
The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam versions anterior to 2.1:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.5.0.0~beta1+options,<option_list>
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src

In both cases, all available options can be listed with "opam search ocaml-option".

**** Optional opam alpha repository

During the beta release, if your dependencies are not yet compatible with OCaml 5.0.0,
you might want to check the alpha opam repository:

https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository

Which can be installed with
#+begin_src shell
opam repo add alpha git+https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
#+end_src
You can check that the alpha repository has been correctly installed with
#+begin_example
$ opam repo
<><> Repository configuration for switch 5.0.0~beta1 <><><><><><><><><><><><><>
 1 alpha   git+https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
 2 default https://opam.ocaml.org
#+end_example
This alpha repository contains various fixes that are in the process of being upstreamed,
but it should be less and less required with the progress of the beta release.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppx-deriving-yaml-0-1-0/7007/2

** Patrick Ferris announced


A new ~0.2.0~ version has just been released. Thanks to all the contributors (including Outreachy applicants!),
there's a lot of nice additions including:

- ~to_yaml~ and ~of_yaml~ attributes allowing you to add custom encoders and decoders
- a ~skip_unknown~ flag for ignoring yaml keys so you can partially decode yaml values
- a ~default~ attribute
- ~[@@deriving yaml]~ is now an alias to ~[@@deriving to_yaml]~ and ~[@@ deriving of_yaml]~ so you can get decoders, encoders or both.

See the documentation in the README: https://github.com/patricoferris/ppx_deriving_yaml
      



* A sandbox for proposing new features in odoc
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-sandbox-for-proposing-new-features-in-odoc/10650/1

** jbeckford announced


/For people interested in good documentation for their projects, but need a bit more from odoc./

I wanted to make a place where the broader OCaml community can experiment and propose odoc features:
[[https://diskuv.github.io/odoc-sandbox/][https://diskuv.github.io/odoc-sandbox/]]

I had two goals for the sandbox:
- Let you visually see any proposals for new features to odoc. Hopefully this will make scoping the proposal easier.
- No one should be blocked. Assuming the proposal is ok, it may take months (or even years) to implement. Any early adopter could use the custom Dune rules from the experiment to adopt in their own projects. Early adoption would be complex (custom Dune rules) but since the syntax shouldn't change they won't have to throw out their documentation.

I have one proposal in the sandbox and more will come later; there are also a few experiments using Sphinx and
Markdown tools.

The first proposal would translate an odoc verbatim block:

#+begin_example
{v
::code-block:: LANGUAGE

source code
v}
#+end_example

into syntax highlighted code. [[https://diskuv.github.io/odoc-sandbox/400-codeblock/index.html][The visual results and the original ~.mli~ are available in experiment
400]].

As I mentioned earlier, it has Dune rules which can be copied if you need it in your own projects. I don't precisely
know _how_ it would be implemented for real in odoc (probably it would be a .mli transformer) but that is not the
point. Instead if you have an implementation idea or simply love/hate the proposal, you can just go to GitHub and
file an issue at [[https://github.com/diskuv/odoc-sandbox/issues][https://github.com/diskuv/odoc-sandbox/issues]].
      



* OCaml Platform Installer alpha release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocaml-platform-installer-alpha-release/10652/1

** Thibaut Mattio announced


In anticipation of the forthcoming OCaml 5 release—and hot on the heels of its beta release—we are thrilled to
announce the alpha release of the [[https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer][OCaml Platform Installer]].

As a reminder, the [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform][OCaml Platform]] is the recommended toolchain for developers to
work with OCaml.

The Platform Installer allows the user to easily setup OCaml's development environment, both for a first-time
installation and for any new opam switches.

You can try it now by following the [installation instructions](#platform-installer-2), but TL;DR, you can install
it with

#+begin_example
$ bash < <(curl -sL https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer/releases/latest/download/installer.sh)
#+end_example

And run it to install the Platform in your opam switch with

#+begin_example
$ ocaml-platform
#+end_example

Don't hesitate to [[https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer/issues][open an issue]] if you encounter any
problem!

*** Update of the Platform State

As part of the work on the Installer, we've updated the [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform][state of the Platform]] to
make it up to date and clarify the requirements to include a project in the Platform. Here are some of the notable
changes:

- ~odoc~ has been promoted from Incubate to Active
- OCamlformat has been promoted from Incubate to Active
- ~ppxlib~ and other metaprogramming frameworks have been removed from the Platform (and ~ppxlib~ is now documented as the official way to do metaprogramming, as part of the official [[https://ocaml.org/docs/metaprogramming][OCaml documentation]])

You can see the complete changes on the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/571][corresponding PR]].

In parallel, we also want to make the Platform more open and transparent. To do this, we want to provide a clear
governance model that can be driven by the community. The governance model should answer questions like:
- How can I incubate my project in the Platform?
- Who decides when a project can be promoted?
- How to discuss changes that would impact multiple Platform projects?

We're currently following the [[https://ocaml.org/governance][OCaml.org's governance]], but are exploring new ways to
govern the OCaml Platform.

We are leaning toward an RFC process for this, but we are still discussing the alternatives and how this could take
shape. We will continue to experiment on the best governance model for the Platform with the project maintainers in
the coming months, and we will publish the resulting governance on OCaml.org.

*** Platform Installer

The Platform Installer provides the best way to install OCaml and the recommended development tools for both
newcomers and existing users.

*Simplicity.* It aims at replacing the [[https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running][existing installation steps]] with a
much simpler workflow.

To install the Platform Installer ~ocaml-platform~, you can run:

#+begin_example
$ bash < <(curl -sL https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-platform-installer/releases/latest/download/installer.sh)
#+end_example

This script will install opam, if not already present in the system, and the latest version of ~ocaml-platform~.

Then, to install the Platform tools:

#+begin_example
$ ocaml-platform
#+end_example

If opam is not initialised, this command will initialise it. Then it will proceed to installing the Platform tools
in the current opam switch.

For first-time users, the above two lines will set them up with a working environment that's complete enough to hack
comfortably with OCaml.

*Speed.* In order to speed up the process of installing development tools, the Installer caches the binaries to
avoid for redundant compilation. For instance, you will only need to compile ~ocamlformat~ once per version of the
tool.

However, some tools such as Merlin depend on the OCaml version. For those, the Installer's cache distinguishes the
binaries, depending on the version of the tool as well the OCaml version it was compiled with.

*Integration.* The Installer integrates the development tools it installs as opam packages to make it fully aware
of what has been installed. The binary provided by the Installer for the ~dune~ tool will allow the installation of
any package with a Dune dependency without reinstalling it.

However, some development tools include libraries in their opam package that are not provided by the Installer. In
this case, installing the original opam package for the tool will replace the one provided by ~ocaml-platform~.

The opam packages installed by ~ocaml-platform~ are dependency-free. This means that installing specific versions of
your development tools will never mess with the actual dependencies of your project!

**** The Tools Installed

The list of tools installed by ~ocaml-platform~ will ultimately be the platform tools listed in the [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform][Platform
Docs]] as either Active and Incubate. Currently, this list is still incomplete for
different reasons, such as keeping installation time short for new users, the number of dependencies, or other
technical constraints.

The set of installed tools already provides a complete working environment, with:

- A build system: Dune
- A documentation generator: ~odoc~
- A code formatter: OCamlformat
- A release helper: ~dune-release~
- Editor integration: ~ocaml-lsp~ and Merlin.

*** Next Steps

There's still a lot to do!

*Governance.* As mentioned above, we should have a clear governance model for how incubation and promotions happen
in the Platform, who decides, and which criterias are applied. This should obviously be an open process driven by
the community; however, we want to make sure that we propose a governance model that will work well, so we're still
discussing alternatives and experimenting on some options. We'd love your input on this, so expect a Discuss post
with a proposed governance model for the Platform soon. Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:thibaut@tarides.com) to
us before then if you want to get involved!

*Editor Integration.* While the Installer is a step forward towards a simple way to install OCaml, the UX for
newcomers can still be improved. We plan to integrate the Installer to the official VSCode plugin. This will provide
a way to get a complete development environment in only a few clicks directly in the editor. We will also explore
how to make the setup of Emacs and Vim more straighforward.

*Remote Cache.* In order to further reduce the time taken to start hacking on a project, we are working on a
remote cache for the Installer. The cache will be populated by a CI and would remove the need for compiling the
tools locally. The local cache and compilation mechanism would still be used as a fallback if the remote repo is
down or incomplete (such as for a pinned compiler).

You can do also do aggregation or, if you are really adventurous, define your own interpreter. Even if you don't
use parameterization you get things you take for granted with OCaml: type-safety, auto-complete and `let`
constants.

The full documentation including installation instructions and examples are available in the [[https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-dune-dsl#readme][README]].

A few cautionary notes:

- The current version (0.1.0 as of Oct 17 2022) does not have 100% coverage of all Dune expressions; it just has the parts of Dune I've needed in my own projects. That includes an encoding of the Ordered Set Language and virtual libraries but not (for example) ~select~ forms, plugins, ctypes and lex/yacc. But I strongly suspect the same people who need a tool like dkml-dune-dsl are the same people who can easily contribute a PR to add any parts of Dune they need.
- The API is unstable; if someone adds more Dune expressions they may have to tweak the API. And I haven't settled on whether the API needs some first-class features to track Dune's ~(lang dune X.Y.Z)~ versioning.
- This is not blessed in any way by the Dune team! Hopefully they don't mind though.
