&gt; Do you have practical hints regarding the l18n or i18n of an application
&gt; (specifically, an application to be runnable either in french or in
&gt; english)?
&gt; 
&gt; Any practical hints are welcome. In particular, it seems to me that the
&gt; novel features of the Printf module could help in particular the format string
&gt; substitution eg printf "%(%d %s)" (I don't know what should come next) .... 
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, I'm seeking advices and examples of how to use advanced
&gt; Printf (&amp; Scanf) features to code a bi-lingual application.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a Printf mini-HOWTO might be helpful?
&gt; 
&gt; What about gettext (or other equivalent?)

There is ocaml-gettext, if you need a gettext library.

 &gt; What you *actually* forgot to tell people is that OCaml
 &gt; unfortunately lacks a macro with which one can store C pointers to
 &gt; alloc_final allocated blocks. If one writes to those using e.g.
 &gt; 
 &gt;   ml_vector = alloc_final(2, finalize_vector, 1, 10);
 &gt;   Store_field(ml_vector, 1,(value)vector);
 &gt; 
 &gt; with vector being a C pointer to a structure, this may or may not
 &gt; lead to random crashes at very unexpected places - because (as I
 &gt; think now) the Store_field macro will be over-eager trying to tell
 &gt; the GC about the value stored - which it should just ignore in this
 &gt; particular case!
 &gt; 
 &gt; Indeed, this has been discussed before, I think:
 &gt; 
 &gt; <a href="http://groups.google.de/group/fa.caml/msg/60ace9405fcf60c0?dmode=source&amp;hl=de">http://groups.google.de/group/fa.caml/msg/60ace9405fcf60c0?dmode=source&amp;hl=de</a>
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, I would strongly suggest introducing a macro that behaves like this:
 &gt; 
 &gt; #define Store_c_field(block,offset,x) (Field(block,offset)=(value)x)
 &gt; 
 &gt; so that one could then use
 &gt; 
 &gt;   Store_c_field(ml_vector, 1,vector);
 &gt; 
 &gt; I actually just spent a full week tracking down precisely this
 &gt; issue in a not particularly trivial C library interface I am
 &gt; building right now.  After looking in the weirdest places, ensuring
 &gt; it's not an issue with the library wrapped, or the trickier pieces
 &gt; of my own code, I even started patching debugging code into the
 &gt; OCaml bytecode's GC and rebuilding...
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, *please* do the world a great favour and tell people about that
 &gt; issue in the C interface documentation!

Well, it already does:
,----
| Rule 3   Assignments to the fields of structured blocks must be done
| with the Store_field macro (for normal blocks) or Store_double_field
| macro (for arrays and records of floating-point numbers). Other
| assignments must not use Store_field nor Store_double_field. 
`----
Final (aka custom) blocks are not structured blocks but raw blocks
(not traced by the GC), so assignements to those blocks falls in the
"other assignments" category.

A good way to deal with custom blocks in the C code is to create a
small struct type and access the content of the block through this type.

struct custom_foo_bar {
  foo *pointer1;
  bar *pointer3;
};

value alloc_foo_bar (foo *f, bar *b)
{
  value v;
  struct custom_foo_bar *s;
  v = alloc_custom (&amp;foo_bar_ops, sizeof struct custom_foo_bar, 1, 10);
  s = Data_custom_val (v);
  s-&gt;p1 = f;
  s-&gt;p2 = b;
  return v;
}
