* Announcing the first release of Alice, a radical OCaml build system

** Continuing this thread, Steve Sherratt announced


[[https://www.alicecaml.org/blog/alice-v0-3-0/][Alice v0.3.0]] is out! This introduces a breaking change which is that Alice now follows the [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/][XDG Base Directory Spec]] in lieu of creating a ~~/.alice~ directory.

To migrate from an older version:
- Delete ~~/.alice~.
- If you have a block in your shell config starting with ~# BEGIN configuration from Alice installer~, remove that block.
- If you installed Alice with the installation script then run the script again (instructions [[https://www.alicecaml.org/install][here]]).
- If you used Alice to install OCaml tools, you'll need to reinstall those tools (run ~alice tools install~).
- If you've configured a custom sandbox template with Visual Studio Code for any Alice projects, change the template based on the new LSP instructions for Visual Studio Code [[https://www.alicecaml.org/lsp/#visual-studio-code][here]].

To enable bash/zsh completions for Alice, source the appropriate file from ~~/.local/share/alice/env~.

[[https://www.alicecaml.org/blog/alice-v0-4-0/][Alice v0.4.0]] is out. The main change is that package manifests now use [[https://kdl.dev/][KDL]] instead of TOML. See [[https://www.alicecaml.org/blog/switching-manifests-to-kdl/][this post]] for the motivation for this change. There's a migration guide [[https://www.alicecaml.org/blog/alice-v0-4-0/#migrating-from-earlier-versions][here]].
      



* OCaml/opam package manager support for Dependabot - I need your help

Hello OCaml community! 😊

Let's kick off the new year with something exciting! I just created a Pull Request to dependabot-core that adds support for Opam in OCaml. This could be super useful for all of us using this ecosystem in our projects!

https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/13877

But the Dependabot maintainers emphasized that maintaining new ecosystems requires community support (check their comment here: [[https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/13711?referrer=grok.com#issuecomment-3659899321][https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/13711#issuecomment-3659899321]]). They already have 3 community-maintained ecosystems and want more, but only if the community helps with long-term updater support.

They will be looking for volunteers to help maintain this – in testing, fixes, or ongoing maintenance. We can push this together if you really want it.

What do you think?
      



* shakuhachi 0.1.0 - A music collection manager

** EruEri announced


Dear all,

I humbly announce shakuhachi `0.1.0`.

Shakuhachi is a music collection manager. It aims to be a rather simple collection manager extensible by plugins. It organizes musics into an artist/album directory structure, can handle multiple collections and provides a mechanism similar to ~GitHub - beetbox/beet~ for querying a collection.  Shakuhachi also exposes some of its internals which allows to hook it inside other applications.

You can visit the source code at [[https://codeberg.org/EruEri/shakuhachi][codeberg - erueri/shakuhachi]].

You can also see an example of integrating shakuhachi inside a C++ music player [[https://codeberg.org/EruEri/audacious-skhc-plugin][codeberg - erueri/audacious-skhc-plugin]].

Sincerely yours.

This is an MP3 player that claims to have good library management - maybe worth a comparison.

* ocaml-posix release 4.0.0

** Romain Beauxis announced


Hi there!

I’m happy to report the release of ~ocaml-posix~ version ~4.0.0~: https://github.com/savonet/ocaml-posix

This collection of modules was started some time ago with the goal of centralizing and normalizing the patterns for binding constants, types (including C ~stuct~ ) and functions from the POSIX standard using ~ctypes~.

The goal is to offer:

- A common set of tools and practices for structuring and binding using ~ctypes~.
- APIs and modules suitable for low-level ~ctypes~ use.
- High level APIs and modules suitable for direct OCaml use.
- Multi platform compatibility: ~*BSD~, ~linux~, ~macos~ and ~windows~when available.
- Cross-platform compilation using ~dune~'s awesome cross-compilation support when applicable (currently only ~posix-errno~and ~posix-socket~)

With this release, 4 new modules have been added:

- ~posix-errno~ to deal with unix error numbers. Although there are some alternatives already existing, this one is a more straight-forward and modern implementation using ~dune~ for building with cross-compilation and multi-platform support.
- ~posix-stat~, ~posix-resource~ and the extensive ~posix-unistd~.

Hopefully these modules can be useful to more developers and provide a common platform for interfacing OCaml programs with system calls in a portable and extensible way!

*** FAQ:

- Why is this not using ~dune~'s direct support for ~ctypes~?

Cross-compilation support requires running binary compiled for the target (e.g. ~windows~) on the host (e.g. ~linux~) in order to extract specific data points such as C constants values and C struct entries offset. Currently, this is not supported using ~dune~' builtin ~ctypes~ support. However, support for this is [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/13112][being worked on]].
