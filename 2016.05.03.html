This is a combined announce for new versions of LablTk and LablGTK,
ready to serve you with OCaml 4.03.

LablTk is an interface for the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit, which allows you to
build user interfaces very fast. It comes with the OCamlBrowser
library explorer, which is not only a good demonstration of the
power of LablTk, but also a useful companion in your everyday
program development.

	<a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/labltk/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/labltk/</a>

Until ocaml-4.01, LablTk and OCamlBrowser were part of the
standard distribution, but they were spun off to simplify maintenance.
This new release contains a few bug fixes, and an upgrade of
OCamlBrowser for OCaml 4.03 (as a result, ocamlbrowser will
not compile on older versions).

LablGTK is an interface for the Gtk+ toolkit, version 2. It also
wraps many extensions, such as libglade, for rapid prototyping,
or gtksourceview2, for programming editors.

	<a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/lablgtk/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/lablgtk/</a>

This is a bug fix release, which in particular fixes some incompatibilities
with 4.03.

Both libraries should also soon be available on opam.

Jacques Garrigue

LablTk 8.06.0 changelog:

* Adapt to ocaml 4.03
* Fix const qualifiers in C code

LablGTK 2.18.4 changelog:

  * update applications
  * Fix ml_gnome_canvas_c2w (Didier Le Botlan)
  * remove build dependency on camlp4 (still needed for tree version)
  * allow to change the GC speed (i.e. the impact of custom blocks)
    see GMain.Gc_custom.set_speed.
  * use own definition of alloc_custom, to be sure to allocate in the heap
  * fix GtkTree.TreeModel.cast
  * add get_image and get_pixbuf to GDraw.drawable.

Markus Weißmann:
&gt;&gt;&gt; The value comes from C bindings, but from a string-value via Char.code.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is then passed through a constructor-function to create the record;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I added a check there to see if the C bindings are to blame:

Gerd Stolpmann:
&gt;&gt; Well, there are other types of errors in C bindings that could also
&gt;&gt; cause this. Imagine what happens when the C bindings do not properly
&gt;&gt; handle pointers (e.g. do not declare them as local roots), and an
&gt;&gt; outdated pointer to an int is followed by the GC because of this.
&gt;&gt; Because the minor GC moves values to the major heap, this could cause
&gt;&gt; that the int is overwritten then.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In my experience, it's always the C binding!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, there's no code for investigations.

Sébastien Hinderer:
&gt; Do you think there is room for improvement at this level?
&gt;
&gt; Do you already have a bit more precise ideas about the kind of tools that
&gt; coould be helpful?

In 2006 there was work on a static analysis tool to check OCaml C
stubs called "Saffire", which you can read about in detail here:
  <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/papers/cs-tr-4845.html">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/papers/cs-tr-4845.html</a>

Adrien Nader extracted the implementation and loaded it on the OCaml
Forge in 2012, anyone interested in fixing/updating the project should
probably get in touch with him:
  <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/saffire/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/saffire/</a>

I have always been curious about how it would fare on the C bindings
in the wild -- my guess is that it may have bitrotten a bit but that
it would find a few issues, and also be very helpful during the
development phase (where you iteratively hunt for segfaults), if it
was an "opam install" away and easy to run.

I have been trying to motivate the Frama-C people to find an excellent
intern to write a specification of the OCaml memory model in ACSL
(their specification language for C, <a href="http://frama-c.com/acsl.html">http://frama-c.com/acsl.html</a> );
the dream is that one may then be able to use Frama-C to check for
safety of the C stubs, and even possibly verify some parts of the C
codebase in the compiler distribution (probably not the runtime
implementation itself, which precisely breaks the abstraction of the
memory model, but at least large parts of C implementation of
primitives, otherlibs/, etc.). I think they are interested as well,
but I'm not sure they have found the time and people to work on this.

Finally, note that Jeremy Yallop's Ctypes (
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes</a> ) may be the better solution
to write correct C bindings. I think that it is complementary with the
above-mentioned efforts:
- Saffire could be used to check legacy C stubs, of which there are many
- A more precise model of the OCaml value representation and exposed
runtime interface could help verify Ctypes itself and other future
projects interacting with the runtime at a lower level.

Ctypes is slightly more restricted than general C stubs, but
substantially more safe (and more convenient). In my experience the
unsafety of C bindings is a huge time sink, so starting with a Ctypes
binding is almost certainly the most productive choice.

I'm glad to announce opam-cross-ios[1], an OPAM-based cross-toolchain
in the spirit and using the conventions of opam-cross-android[2]
and opam-cross-windows[3].

It is based on Gerd Stolpmann's work[4] but expands it so that
1) multi-target deployments are trivial and
2) C libraries can be cross-compiled from within OPAM.
