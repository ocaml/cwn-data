&gt; I'm thinking about to start a new project which has some rather 
&gt; critical requirements. It will be compiled with the native compiler 
&gt; initially targeting Linux/Unix but eventually also windoze. 

&gt; The app consists of a main engine which spawns many short lived 
&gt; child threads or processes. The children go away, do their work and 
&gt; then pass their results back to the main engine. Many of the children 
&gt; will spawn another process and read the child process output via a 
&gt; pipe and many of the children will block on I/O. A small portion of 
&gt; the children may be I/O bound, but there is not way of telling which 
&gt; beforehand. 

&gt; Since I would like to maximize the throughput on multi-core and 
&gt; multi-processor machines I am thinking of using a mix of forking and 
&gt; threading. 


You know that there is no fork on Windows? 
&gt;  For communications, I was thinking of using the Event 
&gt; module for communication between threads, but I don't think that 
&gt; works for forked process (pipes maybe?). 
&gt; Anybody have any advice for this project? Any war stories from similar 
&gt; projects? Any readings they can recommend? 


If there wasn't the Windows requirement I could recommend this: 
You may have a look at ocamlnet2. It includes the netplex library that 
manages parent/children relationships between either forked processes or 
threads. You can use SunRPC for communication (or whatever you like, but 
SunRPC support is included). The bad news is that it does not run on the 
native Windows port, not even in the threaded variant (because there's 
no socketpair...). 

Ah yes, I have a war story, but cannot tell it now. I can only say it is 
used for a really big commercial project.

demexp 0.8 is out! demexp is an electronic voting system for wide 
scale direct democracy. demexp is developed mainly to support the 
democractic experience project (<a href="http://www.demexp.org">http://www.demexp.org</a>), but can be 
used in other contexts (communities, firms, ...). 

Briefly, demexp allows to ask questions ("votes"), to submit 
answers to those questions ("candidate answers"), and to vote on 
the submitted answers to elect a winning answer (using Condorcet voting 
system). 

demexp is implemented as a centralized server and a GTK2 graphical 
client (a Drupal web client will be available soon). A classification 
system allows to navigate through questions. 

* What's new in 0.8? 
  - New configuration file that supports version upgrading; 
  - Support for client internationalization; 
  - Translations of the (English) client in French and Esperanto; 
  - Experimental web client in OCaml (using WDialog); 
  - Improvement of the Windows installer; 
  - simplification of the client's interface; 
  - tooltips on column titles; 
  - various bug fixes on the client and the server. 

* How can I try it? 
 The most recent version of the sources (in OCaml) are here: 
 <a href="http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/demexp/latest-src/">http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/demexp/latest-src/</a> 

 Main code is under GNU General Public License (GPL). It relies on 
 external libraries and code of which licenses are GPL compatible 
 (see source code for details). 

 Once compiled use it to connect to the demonstration server: 
 $ demexp-gtk2-client demexp://demo.demexp.org:50000 

 Packages are also available for various Linux distributions (althought 
 most of them are not 0.8-ready yet). Have a loot at:

Using ocaml-3.09.3-win-msvc 

When I compile the following program as byte code I see a stack overflow

not see the expected overflow exception?

Right.  Given your e-mail address, you might actually understand 
better than I why it is so.  Let me explain: 
The machine code generated by ocamlopt does not test explicitly for 
stack overflows, relying instead on the operating system to detect and 
report them.  However, handling of stack overflow conditions varies 
greatly between processors and operating systems.  Currently: 

- Under Linux/IA32 and Linux/AMD64, stack overflows are properly 
  turned into a Stack_overflow Caml exception.  Similar handling is 
  in the CVS for MacOSX/PPC, and MacOSX/Intel might be feasible soon. 

- Other Unix-like operating systems just report stack overflows 
  as a "segmentation violation" or "bus error" fatal signal. 

- Windows, as you noticed, behaves strangely.  Stack overflows are turned 
  into Win32 system exceptions, but apparently the structured 
  exception handling of Win32 just fails to handle them and silently 
  exits the program.  That might be because the stack frames generated 
  by ocamlopt are nothing like what Win32 expects. 

If you happen to know how to do better under Windows, you're most 
welcome to let me know.

We are pleased to announce the release of Ancient 0.8.0 and 
Weblogs 2.1. 

====================================================================== 
Ancient 0.8.0 

The Ancient module allows you to use in-memory data structures which 
are larger than available memory and so are kept in swap.  If you try 
this in normal OCaml code, you'll find that the machine quickly 
descends into thrashing as the garbage collector repeatedly iterates 
over swapped memory structures.  This module lets you break that 
limitation.  Of course the module doesn't work by magic :-) If your 
program tries to access these large structures, they still need to be 
swapped back in, but it is suitable for large, sparsely accessed 
structures. 

Secondly, this module allows you to share those structures between 
processes.  In this mode, the structures are backed by a disk file, 
and any process that has read/write access that disk file can map that 
file in and see the structures. 

(more here: <a href="http://merjis.com/_file/ancient-readme.txt">http://merjis.com/_file/ancient-readme.txt</a> ) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Differences in this release: 

Previously a hard-coded limit of 1024 objects could be stored in one 
backing file.  This limit has now been removed.

====================================================================== 
Weblogs 2.1 

Weblogs is an OCaml module for importing weblogs from Apache or IIS 
web servers. 

In this major release we have modified the API to use arrays of 
structures instead of lists for efficiency.  We have added support for 
the Ancient module, so that absolutely huge logfiles can now be loaded 
into memory and analysed.  To give you an idea of how large: we have 
analysed 38 GB of logfiles from one customer on a 64-bit desktop 
machine with just 2 GB of physical RAM.

====================================================================== 

Both modules are released under LGPL + OCaml linking exception, to 
make them compatible with the OCaml library and maximise use even in 
commercial applications.
