Happy to share “Camp”, the Caml Amp — an old-school music player heavily inspired by good old Winamp, with a focus on decent music
library and playlist handling.

I was fed up with Winamp being dead and lacking features I wanted, so I went into full-on nerd mode and implemented my own
opinionated replacement, all in OCaml using the Raylib library:

    https://mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/camp/

If you have not yet been sucked in by the streaming cartels, you might find it useful.

- Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Support for WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG, QOA, MOD, and XM
- Advanced music library management with many browse and search features 
- Elaborate playlist manipulation and query-based “smart” playlists
- Animated user interface styled after hifi when it still looked good
  (no corners were rounded in the making of this app)

Enjoy,
/Andreas

** Louis Roché announced


Ahrefs is excited to announce a new *Ahrefs Grant Program for OCaml* to support projects in the OCaml ecosystem. This effort comes in addition to the other sponsorships we do (such as the [[https://ocaml-sf.org/][OCSF]], the [[https://icfp25.sigplan.org/][ICFP]] and [[https://fun-ocaml.com/][Fun OCaml]] conferences, [[https://github.com/orgs/ahrefs/sponsoring][github sponsoring]], and [[https://ahrefs.com/tech][various other projects]]) We are allocating money to fund one or multiple initiatives that help advance OCaml and its tooling.

You can learn more about our engineering culture and opensource support work at [[https://ahrefs.com/tech][https://ahrefs.com/tech]]

*** Call for Applications

We invite individuals, teams, and organizations working with OCaml to submit proposals for funding. Our goal is to support meaningful, practical improvements to the ecosystem, whether through new tools, libraries, infrastructure, education, or long‑term maintenance of existing projects.

Applications should be submitted through [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUNAAnzYezhL6HRraUcbky_VBk9klLdh86TFJWBI8TKhpqcw/viewform][this google form]].

The deadline for submissions is January 20th 2026.

*** What We Are Looking For

We welcome proposals that:

- Strengthen the OCaml compiler or core libraries
- Improve developer experience (tooling, documentation, debugging, profiling, packaging, …)
- Expand the OCaml ecosystem through new libraries or modernization of key dependencies
- Enhance reliability, performance, or safety of OCaml‑based systems
- Support education, community infrastructure, or long‑term maintenance

Both small and large initiatives are welcome. We will prioritize projects that will have lasting impact and will be maintained.

The selection of proposal will necessarily be subjective and depend on our priorities and interests.

*** Funding

Applicants may request up to *USD 50,000* in support per project. We may award a single project or distribute among several proposals.

- A title
- Short abstract 
- Expected time slot 

*Deadline*: 1st February 2026

We’ve set a deadline so we have enough time to finalize the programme and handle the practical organisation (room setup, schedule, announcements, etc.).

*** Call for participation 

You’re very welcome to attend even if you’re not presenting. If you plan to attend, please register [[https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/caml-in-the-capital-feb-2026-tickets-1977730614507?aff=oddtdtcreator][here]].


Many thanks to Imperial College for hosting us and OCaml Software Foundation for funding us!! :raised_hands:

* Dream – looking for maintainers to take ownership
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/dream-looking-for-maintainers-to-take-ownership/17607/1

** Anton Bachin announced


*[[https://github.com/camlworks/dream][Dream]]*, the Web framework, is looking for a maintenance team!

I originally wrote Dream in 2021, and actively maintained it for several years. It has gotten many great contributions from other authors since its first release, for which I am very grateful!

At the present time, I am no longer in a position to sustainably maintain Dream. I’d like to yield it to one or several maintainers, who would have the ability to pursue their vision, bring their ideas, credibly seek funding for work that substantially affects it, and cite it on their resume or elsewhere. In other words, to take ownership of it. I would stay on in an advisory role, to transfer knowledge, help negotiate, and assist in various ways, as a volunteer.

We’ve already been having Dream community development meetings over on Discord since August, which have been very helpful. Last month, I transferred Dream to an org on GitHub. It’s ready for the next step :slight_smile: 

Dream has a very large amount of interesting work to do. The original motivation was not only to create a modern, highly ergonomic Web framework in a minimal sense, but to do a whole tour through the OCaml Web development ecosystem and address every other place where a major library is missing, or where quality of life can be improved. See the [[https://github.com/camlworks/dream/wiki/Roadmap][roadmap]] for some of the many ideas.

In fact, we had started working on this back in 2022 with a small team of people, and created an OAuth library. That enterprise was unfortunately terminated by events outside our control, and the logical step now is for me to yield control of Dream itself to a differently structured team, for its natural development :slight_smile: 

If you’re interested, please DM me here on Discuss! If you have such, please link your projects related to Web development, or where you have been a maintainer. Let me know if you’re a user of Dream, and what you’d like to see in Web development in OCaml.

Thank you!
      



* QCheck 0.90: The Great Renaming
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-qcheck-0-90-the-great-renaming/17613/1

** Jan Midtgaard announced


It is my pleasure to announce release 0.90 of the QCheck packages. QCheck is an
OCaml library for randomized property-based testing in the style of Haskell's
QuickCheck.

  https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/releases/tag/v0.90

It has been over 12 years and 40 releases since @c-cube released version 0.1
back in October 2013. Over this period QCheck has grown organically
- with new combinators on a "by-need" basis and
- with a separate ~QCheck2~ module offering generators with integrated shrinking.

This has unfortunately resulted in a bit of a naming mess with inconsistent
generator names. For example, the (now deprecated) ~small_int~ combinator will
generate only small non-negative numbers, and a combinator for generating
positive integers uniformly is named either ~pint~ or ~pos_int~ across different
QCheck modules.

The 0.90 release thus takes on a cleanup under the heading "The Great Renaming".
To guide the renaming process, we have assembled a list of hard-learned
naming principles:

- Generator names should align with type names (~bool~, ~char~, ... ~list~, ~option~) to be as predictable as possible
- We should have short, unparameterized generators (~int~, ~string~, ...) to lower the barrier to entry
- Specialized generators also start with the type name, but use a consistent suffix (~_pos~, ~_neg~, ~_size~, ~_of~, ...) to help find them, e.g., with tab-completion
- We may include a few shorthand names for convenience (e.g., ~nat~)
- Overall we aim to be as consistent as possible, e.g., offering similar signatures
  across generator interfaces (~QCheck.Gen~, ~QCheck.arbitrary~, and ~QCheck2.Gen~)

The 0.90 release thus both
- introduces a range of new (and hopefully more consistent) combinator names and
- deprecates a sizable number of old, inconsistent combinator names

The deprecated combinators have been annotated with ~@@deprecated~ attributes.

Rather than let a couple more years pass with an even bigger and more confusing
name pool, we are using this opportunity to prepare a long overdue 1.0.0
release, where we will remove the old, deprecated combinator names.

We understand that updating existing tests to the new names takes some effort, but appeal to
users that this should be a one-time investment to
- offer more consistent and easier to recall combinator names and simultaneously
- let us clean up QCheck tech debt and address a long-time pain point.


The changes are summarized in a record-long CHANGELOG section for the release:

  https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/blob/v0.90/CHANGELOG.md

and [[https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/issues/366][c-cube/qcheck#366]] provides a run down of the renaming process.

Finally, on behalf of the maintainers I would like to thank
- the various folks contributing to QCheck over the past 12 years and
- the OCaml Software Foundation for financially supporting the work on these
  past three releases.


Merry Christmas and happy testing! :evergreen_tree: :wrapped_gift:
