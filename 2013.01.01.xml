      <cwn_what>
&gt; I am trying to wrap a C library in OCaml but I don't know how to do
&gt; this particular thing:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a library that looks roughly like this:
&gt; 
&gt; int function(void** ptr);
&gt; 
&gt; So I get an int as return value to show whether the function succeeded
&gt; and it *sets* the ptr.
&gt; 
&gt; void* ptr;
&gt; function(&amp;ptr);
&gt; // ptr is different now
&gt; 
&gt; How can I wrap such a function in OCaml?
&gt; When I call my OCaml wrapper
&gt; 
&gt; let retval = function ptr in
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; the pointer does not get updated. Is there a function in the C API to
&gt; force OCaml to update the values?

Use a '&lt;yourtype&gt; ref' for the parameter (or a record with a mutable field) 
on the OCaml side,
and you can update the field on the C side then.

Or if your C type is not actually void*, and your C function doesn't have 
side-effects (besides updating ptr)
you can also make the OCaml function return the actual value, and raise an 
exception if the function failed.

&gt;&gt; Use a '&lt;yourtype&gt; ref' for the parameter (or a record with a mutable
&gt;&gt; field) on the OCaml side, and you can update the field on the C side
&gt;&gt; then.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking about the same thing and checked
&gt;
&gt; http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/ocaml/ocaml-wrapping-c.php
&gt; and
&gt; http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual033.html
&gt;
&gt; and couldn't find how to modify a ref value from C.
&gt;
&gt; My code looks like this:
&gt;
&gt; CAMLprim value ost_read_next_header(value archive, value entry)
&gt; {
&gt; struct archive* handle = (struct archive*)archive;
&gt; struct archive_entry* ent = (struct archive_entry*)entry;
&gt; printf("ent: %p\n", ent);
&gt; int retval = archive_read_next_header(handle, &amp;ent);
&gt; // ent changed
&gt; printf("ent: %p\n", ent);
&gt; entry = (value)ent;
&gt; return Val_int(retval);
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; And the second parameter is defined as "entry ref", yet when I look at
&gt; the resulting value from OCaml, the ref's value did not change:
&gt;
&gt; let entry = ref (Archive.entry_new ()) in
&gt; Archive.print_pointer !entry;
&gt; ...
&gt; ignore (Archive.read_next_header handle entry);
&gt; Archive.print_pointer !entry;
&gt;
&gt; It still points to the same value that my Archive.entry_new returned.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Or if your C type is not actually void*, and your C function doesn't
&gt;&gt; have side-effects (besides updating ptr) you can also make the OCaml
&gt;&gt; function return the actual value, and raise an exception if the
&gt;&gt; function failed.
&gt;
&gt; I thought about this, but I have a number of these functions and some
&gt; have more than one return parameter, so I'd need to return a tuple at
&gt; least. I plan to make this wrapper as close to C and low-level, so I
&gt; can write a proper high-level wrapper on top.
&gt;
&gt; If the ref-appoach does not get me anywhere, I might still do this.

References are a derived concept defined as:

type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a }

You can update them from the C side just as you would handle a
polymorphic record, with Field and Store_field.

In the code you show, the OCaml value corresponding to the pointer is
exactly the pointer, hidden as a 'value' type. This is correct as
OCaml detects out-of-(OCaml)-heap pointer. However, if you used a
custom block instead (
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual033.html#toc150
), OCaml would do the boxing for you: Data_custom_val(v) already
returns a pointer than can be dereferenced or mutated.

I think you have a choice between using references explicitly for
those functions of the API that mutate input references, or uniformly
representing this type of data as a custom block. The latter option
may be valuable if you have uses for the other features of custom
blocks, eg. the user-defined comparison and finalization operations,
and probably not worth the trouble otherwise. Finally, explicitly
using references to signal mutability in some part of your API is
probably clearer and a better design.
