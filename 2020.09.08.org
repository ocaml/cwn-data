* OCaml 4.11.1: early bugfix release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-11-1-early-bugfix-release/6337/1

** octachron announced


A serious bug has been discovered last week in OCaml 4.11.0:
explicit polymorphic annotations are checked too permissively.
Some incorrect programs (possibly segfaulting) are accepted
by the compiler in 4.11.0.

Programs accepted by OCaml 4.10 are unchanged.

We are thus releasing OCaml 4.11.1 as an early bugfix version.
You are advised to upgrade to this new version if you were
using OCaml 4.11.0.

It is (or soon will be) available as a set of OPAM switches with
#+begin_example
  opam switch create 4.11.1
#+end_example

and as a source download here:
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.11/

This bug was introduced when making polymorphic recursion
easier to use. We are working on making the typechecker
more robust and more exhaustively tested to avoid such
issues in the future.

*** Bug fixes:

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9856][#9856]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9857][#9857]]: Prevent polymorphic type annotations from generalizing weak polymorphic variables. (Leo White, report by Thierry Martinez, review by Jacques Garrigue)

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9859][#9859]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9862][#9862]]: Remove an erroneous assertion when inferred function types appear in the right hand side of an explicit :> coercion (Florian Angeletti, report by Jerry James, review by Thomas Refis)

* Some SIMD in your OCaml
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/some-simd-in-your-ocaml/6367/1

** Anmol Sahoo announced


Fresh from a weekend of hacking, I would like to share some results of an experiment I conducted of
creating a library for exposing Intel AVX2 intrinsics to OCaml code. AVX2 is an instruction set subset
that adds data-parallel operations in hardware.

I chose to fork the amazing [[https://github.com/inhabitedtype/bigstringaf][bigstringaf]] library and
modified it. You can find the additions to the code here -
[[https://github.com/anmolsahoo25/bigstringaf/blob/8df94c4fb5607317ee9634611784eea65368a270/lib/bigstringaf_simd.mli#L287][bigstringaf_simd]].

*** Overview
Given a type ~Bigstring.t~ (1 dimensional byte arrays) there now exist functions such as -
#+begin_src ocaml
val cmpeq_i8 : (t * int) -> (t * int) -> (t * int) -> unit
#+end_src
So ~cmpeq_i8 (x,o1) (y,o2) (z,03)~ will compare 32 bytes starting at ~o1~ and ~o2~ from ~x~ and ~y~
respectively and store the result in ~z~ at ~o3~.

*** Why?
This was mainly an exercise in curiosity. I just wanted to learn whether something like this is viable.
I also want to see if adding some type-directed magic + ppx spells can let us write data parallel code
much more naturally similar to what ~lwt / async~ did for async code.

At the same time, you might ask - why not use something like Owl (which already has good support for
data-parallel operations)? Apart from the fact that such libraries are oriented towards numerical code,
I would also like to explore if we can operate directly on OCaml types and cast them into data parallel
algorithms. Like how ~simdjson~ pushed the boundaries of JSON parsing, it would be nice to port
idiomatic code to data-parallel versions in OCaml. Can we, at some point, have generic traversals of
data-types, which are actually carried out in a data-parallel fashion?

*** Does it work?
Given the limitation of the current implementation (due to foreign function calls into C), I still
found some preliminary results to be interesting! Implementing the ~String.index~ function, which
returns the first occurence of a char, the runtime for finding an element at the ~n-1~ position in an
array with ~320000000~ elements is -
#+begin_example
serial: 1.12 seconds
simd: 0.72 seconds (1.5x)
#+end_example
I still have to do the analysis what the overhead of the function call into C is (even with
~[@@noalloc]~!

*** Future directions
It would be interesting to see, if we can create a representation which encapsulates the various SIMD
ISA's such as AVX2, AVX512, NEON, SVE etc. Further more, it would be really interesting to see if we
can use ppx to automatically widen `map` functions to operate on blocks of code, or automatically cast
data types in a data parallel representation.

*** Disclaimer
This was mostly a hobby project, so I cannot promise completing any milestones or taking feature
requests etc. I definitely do not recommend using this in production, because of the lack of testing
etc.
      



* A PPX Rewriter approach to ocaml-migrate-parsetree
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-ppx-rewriter-approach-to-ocaml-migrate-parsetree/6369/1

** Chet Murthy announced


*** TL;DR

Based on ~camlp5~ and the ~pa_ppx~ PPX rewriters, I've written a new one,
~pa_deriving_plugins.rewrite~, that automates almost all the work of writing a migration from one
version of OCaml's AST to another.
1. It took a few days (b/c of laziness) to write the initial PPX rewriter
2. A day to get 4.02->4.03 AST migration working
3. a couple of hours to get 4.03->4.02 working
4. and a few more hours to get 4.03<->4.04 and 4.04<->4.05 working

At this point, I fully expect that the other version-pairs will not be difficult.

You can find this code [warning: very much a work-in-progress] at
https://github.com/chetmurthy/pa_ppx/tree/migrate-parsetree-hacking

The file ~pa_deriving.plugins/pa_deriving_rewrite.ml~ contains the source for the PPX rewriter.

The directory ~pa_omp~ contains the migrations, typically named ~rewrite_NNN_MMM.ml~.

*** A slightly longer-winded explanation

If you think about it, ~ppx_deriving.map~ isn't so different from what
we need for ~ocaml-migrate-parsetree~.  ~ppx_deriving.map~, from a type definition for ~ 'a t~, will
automatically generate a function
#+begin_src ocaml
map_t : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
#+end_src
If you think about it, if we could just substitute our own type for the second occurrence of ~t~
(somehow .... yeah *grin*) then it would be almost like what we want for o-m-p, yes?

With 11 versions of the Ocaml AST so far, maybe it's worth thinking about how to automate more of the
migration task.  Also, since so much of it is type-structure-driven, one would think that it would be
an excellent opportunity to apply PPX rewriting technology.  *Indeed, one might think that a good test of PPX rewriting, is the ability to automate precisely such tasks.*

So what's hard about this migration task?  Here are some issues (maybe there are more):
1. the types are slightly differently-organized in different versions of the AST.  Types might move from one module to another.
2. sometimes new types are introduced and old ones disappear
3. constructor data-types may get new branches, or lose them
4. record-types may get new fields, or lose them
5. sometimes the analogous types in two consecutive versions are just really, really different [but this is rare]: we need to supply the code directly
6. when mapping from one version to another, sometimes features are simply not mappable, and an error needs to be raised; that error ought to contain an indication of where in the source that offending feature was found
7. And finally, when all else fails, we might need to hack on the migration code directly

But morally, the task is really straightforward (with problems listed in-line):

1. use ~ppx_import~ to copy over types from each of the AST times of each Ocaml version
   - ~ppx_import~ works on ~.cmi~ files, and those have different formats in different versions of Ocaml.  Wouldn't it be nice if it worked on ~.mli~ files, whose syntax (b/c OCaml is well-managed) doesn't change much?
2. build a single OCaml module that has all the AST types in it (from all the versions of OCaml)
  - but without the form
    #+begin_src ocaml
    type t = M.t = A of .. | B of ....
    #+end_src
	  that is, without the "type equation" that allows for a new type-definition to precisely repeat a previous one.
3. Then use ~ppx_import~ against this single module to construct a recursive type-declaration list of all the AST types for a particular version of OCaml, and apply a "souped-up" version of ppx_deriving.map to it, to map the types to *another* version of the AST types.
  - but ~ppx_deriving.map~ doesn't do this today, and besides, it would have to provide a bunch of "escape hatches" for all the special-cases I mentioned above.

But this is in principle doable, and it has the nice feature that all the tedious boilerplate is
mechanically-generated from type-definitions, hence likely to not contain errors (assuming the PPX
rewriter isn't buggy).

So I decided to do it, and this little post is a result.

*** Discussion

I think this is a quite viable approach to writing ~ocaml-migrate-parsetree~, and I would encourage the
PPX community to consider it.  One of the nice things about this approach, is that it relies *heavily*
on PPX rewriting itself, to get the job done.  I think one of the important things we've learned in
programming languages research, is that our tools need to be largely sufficient to allow us to
comfortably implement those same tools.  It's a good test of the PPX infrastructure, to see if you can
take tedious tasks and automate them away.

I'm not going to describe anymore of how this works, b/c I'd rather
get the rest of the migrations working, start figuring out how to
test, and get this code integrated with camlp5.

But for anybody who's interested, I'd be happy to interactively
describe the code and walk them thru how it works.
      

** Louis Roché then asked


For a person who hasn't digged into OMP, can you explain how it is different from what is done
currently? Because the idea I had of OMP is basically what you describe, a set of functions
transformation an AST from vX to vX-1 and vX+1. So I am obviously missing something.
      

** Chet Murthy replied


Yes, you're right: imagine a series of modules M2...M11.  Each declares the same set of types, but with
different definitions, yes?  Then you'd have migration modules, ~migrate_i_j~ (j=i+1 or j=i-1) that
have functions that convert between the analogously-named types.  The entire question is: how are these
functions implemented?  By hand?  With significant mechanized support?  They can't be implemented
fully-mechanically, because there are decisions to be made about how to bridge differences in
type-definitions.  For instance, look at the 4.02 type ~label~ and the 4.03 type ~arg_label~.
Sometimes these are analogous (and sometimes they're not).  When they're analogous, the code that
converts between -cannot- be automatically inferred: a human has to write it.  But -most- of the code
of these migration functions can be inferred automatically from the type-definitions themselves.

And that's really all that my little experiment does: automatically infer the migration code (most of
the time) with some hints for those cases where it's not possible to automatically infer.

Now, why would one do this?  Well, two reasons:

1. it should be more maintainable to automatically generate most of the code from types, and it should be quicker to bring online a migration for a new version of the Ocaml AST.
2. this should be a good test of PPX rewriting.  That is, if we're going to build a macro-preprocessing support system, shouldn't it be able to make solving such straightforward, but very tedious, problems much, much easier?
      

** Chet Murthy then added


I forgot to add a third reason why this PPX-rewriter-based approach is better:

3. If you look at ocaml-migrate-parsetree "migrations", you'll find that they're almost all boilerplate code.  But sprinkled here-and-there, is actual logic, actual decisions about how to come up with values for new fields, about which fields, when non-trivial (e.g. not "[]") should lead to migration-failure, etc.  It is this code, that is the actual meat of the migration, and it's not at all obvious, when sprinkled thru the mass of mechanically-produclble boilerplate.

A mechanized production of that boilerplate would mean that we retained explicitly only this nontrivial code, and hence for maintenance we could focus on it, and make sure it does the right thing.
      

** Josh Berdine asked


Figuring out ways to make maintaining this stuff more efficient would be great! One aspect that isn't
clear to me is how this approach compares to the process currently used to generate the omp code. I
haven't done it myself, but at first glance the tools to generate the omp code (e.g. gencopy) seem to
also accurately be describable as heavily using ppx infrastructure in order to implement the map code
from one version to another. Is there an executive summary that compares and contrasts that and this
proposal?
      

** Chet Murthy replied


From the README, gencopy is used to generate a prototype file for each migration, and then a human goes
in and fixes up the code.  A way to put my point is: gencopy should be provided the fixups in some
compact form, and apply them itself.

I'm happy to announce release of [[https://github.com/daypack-dev/telltime][telltime]] 0.0.1, a small cli
tool for interacting with Daypack-lib (a schedule, time, time slots handling library) components.

It primarily answers time related queries, with support for union (~||~), intersect (~&&~) and "ordered
select" (~>>~, explanation of this is at the bottom).

The query language, time expression, aims to mimic natural language, but without ambiguity. The grammar
is only documented in the online demo [[https://daypack-dev.github.io/time-expr-demo/][here]] at the
moment.

Some examples copied from the README are as follows.

One specific differing case would be when the search starts at 4pm today, ~3pm || 5pm~ would return 5pm
today and 3pm tomorrow, and so on, while ~3pm >> 5pm~ would return 3pm tomorrow and 5pm tomorrow (a 5pm
is only picked after a 3pm has been picked already).

I am happy to announce this milestone release of Sihl, a web framework for OCaml.

Github: https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl \\
opam: http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/sihl/

Sihl is really just a collection of services that can be plugged into each other and a tiny core that
knows how to start them. The goal is to take care of infrastructure concerns so you can focus on the
domain.

After many iterations, the API is in a shape where we dare to show it to you :slight_smile:
It is still under heavy development so expect breakage without a major version bump. However, we just
finished migrating a project from Reason on NodeJS to OCaml on Sihl, so we use it in production.

We provide service implementations that were useful to us so far. In the future we want to provide many
more to cover all kinds of needs. (PRs are always welcome!)

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, thanks! :)

this library also uses indirection internally when handling nested promises in order to ensure that the
bindings are type safe.

This project is part of ongoing work to port
[[https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform][vscode-ocaml-platform]] to Js_of_ocaml.

Generated documentation can be found
[[https://mnxn.github.io/promise_jsoo/promise_jsoo/Promise/index.html][here]].
