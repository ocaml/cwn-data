* Dune 2.3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-2-3-0/5184/1

** Rudi Grinberg announced


On behalf of the dune team, I'm proud to announce the 2.3.0 release of dune. This release is particularly relevant for users of coq that use dune to build their theories, developers of coq that use dune to build their favorite theorem
prover. I'd like to thank @ejgallego for all the hard work to improve dune in this regard.

I'd also like to point out the ~(strict_package_deps)~ option that is now available in project files. This option will now ask dune to validate the package dependencies specified in the ~package~ stanzas in your dune-project files.

Here's the full change list, and as always, happy hacking!

*** 2.3.0 (15/02/2020)

- Improve validation and error handling of arguments to ~dune init~ (#3103, fixes
  #3046, @shonfeder)

- ~dune init exec NAME~ now uses the ~NAME~ argument for private modules (#3103,
  fixes #3088, @shonfeder)

- Avoid linear walk to detect children, this should greatly improve
  performance when a target has a large number of dependencies (#2959,
  @ejgallego, @aalekseyev, @Armael)

- [coq] Add ~(boot)~ option to ~(coq.theories)~ to enable bootstrap of
  Coq's stdlib (#3096, @ejgallego)

- [coq] Deprecate ~public_name~ field in favour of ~package~ (#2087, @ejgallego)

- Better error reporting for "data only" and "vendored" dirs. Using these with
  anything else than a strict subdirectory or ~*~ will raise an error. The
  previous behavior was to just do nothing  (#3056, fixes #3019, @voodoos)

- Fix bootstrap on bytecode only switches on windows or where ~-j1~ is set.
  (#3112, @xclerc, @rgrinberg)

- Allow ~enabled_if~ fields in ~executable(s)~ stanzas (#3137, fixes #1690
  @voodoos)

- Do not fail if ~ocamldep~, ~ocamlmklib~, or ~ocaml~ are absent. Wait for them
  to be used to fail (#3138, @rgrinberg)

- Introduce a ~strict_package_deps~ mode that verifies that dependencies between
  packages in the workspace are specified correctly. (@rgrinberg, #3117)

- Make sure the ~@all~ alias is defined when no ~dune~ file is present
  in a directory (#2946, fix #2927, @diml)

** Continuing this thread, Stéphane Lavergne said


Aside from Mascot and ~ppx_js_style~, it seems that [[https://github.com/OCamlPro/typerex-lint][ocp-lint]] is actively maintained by the folks at OcamlPro. I personally only use ~ocamlformat~ so I can't vouch for it, but it seems
promising.
