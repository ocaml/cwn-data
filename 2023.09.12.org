** Calascibetta Romain announced


I'm pleased to announce the experimental release of Miou (~0.0.1~beta1~): a round-robing scheduler for OCaml 5.
Miou is a small library that focuses on implementing system & network applications.

You can now find the project on [[https://github.com/roburio/miou][GitHub]], Robur's
[[https://git.robur.coop/robur/miou][repository]], as well as [[https://docs.osau.re/miou/][its documentation]] and a
few tutorials. This release was marked by the implementation of a
[[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305][happy-eyeballs]]/dns [1] client combining
concurrency and parallelism. The aim is to be able to continue implementing services using this library and to
guide the user/developer towards good system practices.

The project is still in an iteration phase with the implementation of services such as dns and email in order to
validate our design. This release invites you to iterate with us to benefit from everyone's experience.

We will complete this thread with articles specifying the implementation of Miou. The documentation gives a good
overview of our objectives and the Miou framework. If you are interested, we invite you to read it.

We would like to thank everyone who has been involved in any way in the project for their experience and their
contributions. And we hope to consider other experiences and feedback in order to develop Miou in the same way as
[[https://robur.coop][Robur]] has already done for the other projects.

*[1]*: Implementing [[https://github.com/roburio/happy-eyeballs][happy-eyeballs]] via the
excellent [[https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns][ocaml-dns]] project has enabled us to:
1) check that it is possible to launch a background task managing connections without being able to *detach* a task
2) satisfy the notions of [[https://docs.osau.re/miou/Miou/Ownership/index.html][socket ownership]]
3) implement a real application using one of the protocols we maintain
      



* Eio Digest #1 (September 2023)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2

** Sudha Parimala announced


As we're bracing towards an update to Eio 1.0 after ICFP (famous last words, just kidding :D), the team is happy to
present updates on Eio and friends. We hope to carry this out on monthly or bi-monthly basis, in line with the
precedent set by Multicore Monthlies, the Platform Newsletter and others.

For the uninitiated, [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio][Eio]] is a direct-style concurrency library for OCaml
5 and beyond. Eio leverages effect handlers for non-blocking IO, and at the same time offers advantages such as
enhanced support for backtraces and being able to write concurrent code in direct-style.

Additionally, Eio offers fast native backends for various operating systems when available, such as ~io_uring~ for
Linux. Eio is conceived to be a replacement for existing monadic concurrency libraries such as Lwt.

[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/releases/tag/v0.12][Eio 0.12 was released]] not long ago. The pending tasks
for Eio 1.0 are being tracked at [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/388][Eio#338]].

Before going on with detailed updates, I'd like to take a moment to thank all contributors and users for spending
their time on Eio. Without their collective efforts, there is no way we could be as far in the development of Eio
as we are. If you're interested in contributing or testing we'd be more than happy to welcome you to the community!

*** Updates

Eio has undergone significant developments and improvements in the past few months. Notably, it replaces the OCaml
object system with polymorphic variants to represent OS resources, thereby making code more accessible. Eio also
boasts various backends, including a fast native IO backend for Linux's ~io_uring~ and a generic POSIX backend,
while also exploring possibilities for macOS and Windows support.

Moreover, Eio is making strides in JavaScript interoperability, aiming to target browser applications. The latest
release introduces a resource pool, akin to ~Lwt_pool~, and anticipates support for custom events with the
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/meio][~meio~]] CLI tool. Quite a few applications have started migrating to Eio,
including Irmin, Wayland, ~ocaml-grpc~, OCaml CI's solver service and more, expanding Eio's utility across diverse
domains.

**** Replacing objects with variants

PR: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/553

Originally, Eio's capabilities were encoded using the OCaml object system. However, as objects in OCaml are not a
widely used feature, there was concern from the community that reliance on the object system would hinder wider
adoption of Eio. As a result of this feedback, Eio now uses polymorphic variants to serve the same function as
objects did previously.

Polymorphic variants are better understood by most OCaml practitioners and we hope that this change will enable
more users to adopt Eio. Very little code is expected to break as a result, and this change will be made available
in other libraries built with Eio soon.

**** Backends

One of the goals of Eio is to provide fast native IO backends for major operating systems. It is for this reason
that we started with a backend for ~io_uring~, Linux's state-of-the-art, high-performance I/O API. We eventually
added a ~libuv~ backend  (through Luv), which allowed portability across multiple operating systems, vis-Ã -vis
Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Unfortunatley it also caused [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/434][several
problems]], and we ended up replacing it with ~eio_posix~.

~Eio_posix~ is a generic POSIX backend, using [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-iomux][~ocaml-iomux~]]. The
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/tree/main/lib_eio_windows][Windows backend]] is functional (pun intended),
with more improvements being added. At some point, we may rethink a Grand Central Dispatch backend and IO
Completion ports backend for MacOS and Windows respectively.

**** Javascript Interop

PR: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/405

Having talked about backends for major operating systems, one cannot ignore browsers, which are getting
increasingly common. We have a WIP browser backend for enabling Eio to target Javascript (and Jsoo) applications.
This is a promising avenue that opens up possibilities for
Lwt based libraries that use Jsoo to migrate to Eio.

Furthermore, [[https://github.com/patricoferris/eiojsoo/tree/main][~eiojsoo~]] shows some interesting examples of Eio
+ Js_of_ocaml in action.

**** Pool and Lazy

- Pool: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/602
- Lazy: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/609

The latest release of Eio provides a pool. This is similar to ~Lwt_pool~, helpful for managing a collection of
resources. For instance, it's possible that maintaining a *pool* of expensive resources such as domains or
database connections is more memory and resource efficient than the alternative.

The latest release also includes a fiber-safe lazy module (~Eio.Lazy~) that allows lazy values to be forced
concurrently from multiple fibers.

**** Custom Events (meio)

OCaml 5.1 will have support for user-defined custom events, extending the ring-buffer based event tracing system.
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/meio][~meio~]] is a [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/console][tokio-console]] style
CLI tool for real time monitoring of Eio programs. The hope is that it will make debugging Eio programs a more
pleasant experience. The tool is currently experimental. We hope to have an initial release scheduled for after
OCaml 5.1 is out.

**** Splitting Eio Core

Issue: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/544

Something we discussed in our developer meeting is potentially splitting out the core Fiber as a separate library.
A potential use-case of this might be formally verifying Eio Fibers. While no decisions have been made on this yet,
we're interested to know if this could be useful for anything not mentioned above.

**** Applications

Several applications have started harnessing the power of Eio. Below are some we know of:

*Irmin*

In a first for the library, Irmin has a shiny new [[https://github.com/mirage/irmin/tree/eio][Eio backend]]. Irmin,
the distributed database (which is used as storage system for Tezos, amongst others), has started migrating to Eio
with the eventual goal of supporting multicore Irmin. Stay tuned to hear more about this from the Irmin team.

*Wayland*

Eio 0.12 added support for SCM_RIGHTS. This allowed conversion of the
[[https://github.com/talex5/ocaml-wayland/tree/eio][ocaml-wayland]] library to Eio. That, in turn, allowed an Eio
port of [[https://github.com/talex5/wayland-proxy-virtwl/tree/eio][wayland-proxy-virtwl]]. These ports should be
merged and released soon.

*OCaml-grpc*

Repository: https://github.com/dialohq/ocaml-grpc

~ocaml-grpc~ now includes an Eio mode. @quernd reported that it has been deployed in their production systems and
is working quite well.

*Solver Service*

OCaml CI's solver service is now [[https://github.com/ocurrent/solver-service/pull/71][powered by Eio]]. This has
also made the solver service multicore. The Lwt version is still active because we are still debugging some
performance issues with the Eio version.

*Eio-solo5*

Available at: https://github.com/TheLortex/eio-solo5

We're committed to preserving Eio's compatibility with the larger Mirage ecosystem. With that in mind, ~eio-solo5~
is a small experiment that demonstrates Dream running over Eio and Mirage libraries.

*Nixpackages*

PR: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/230270

Thanks to @toastal, Eio and sub-packages are now available at Nix packages.

**** Call to Action

*Windows*

The good news is that we have a functional Windows backend for Eio (shout-out to @patricoferris). Not so good news
is that we haven't done an awful lot of stress testing on it. If you are running Eio on Windows, we're eager to
hear what works, and more importantly what doesn't. We intend for the Windows backend to be a first class citizen,
in alignment with the overarching objective of upholding Windows as a primary platform within the OCaml ecosystem.
That means resolving bugs and improving workflows, so please let us know about your experience using Eio on
Windows.

** Chet Murthy announced


Hi, I've just released ~pcre2-ocaml~, a wrapper around the Debian package ~pcre2~ (for PCRE new version #2, PCRE2).  ~pcre-ocaml~, the long-standing version by Markus Mottl will become obsolete b/c Debian is removing support for the underlying Debian package ~pcre3~ (PCRE  old version #1, PCRE1).

[yes, this is confusing.]

This is a port by @tobil4sk (don't know their ID on this forum): I'm (for now) just maintaining it.

https://github.com/camlp5/pcre2-ocaml

It should be available in opam by now.

I've already found a bug (courtesy of @viritrilbia ) and have a fix with the beginning of unit-tests ready to release.

If anybody has any interest in joining in to maintain this package, please do contact me.
      



* Third (and hopefully last) release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/third-and-hopefully-last-release-candidate-for-ocaml-5-1-0/12975/1

** octachron announced


Since last week, there were two significant bugs fixed in the OCaml 5.1.0 runtime (one overflow bug, and a stack
corruption bug in the s390x port). Since those bug fixes are as small as they are subtle, they were deemed worthy
of a release of a third release candidate for OCaml 5.1.0.

If there are no more surprises this week, the release of OCaml 5.1.0 shall happen next week.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][OCaml's issue tracker]].

The full changelog for OCaml 5.1.0 is available [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes][on GitHub]]

A short summary of the two fixed bugs in this release candidate is also available below.

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1 and later:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc3
#+end_src

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-rc3.tar.gz][GitHub]]
- [[https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~rc3.tar.gz][OCaml archives at Inria]]

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc3+options <option_list>
#+end_src
where ~<option_list>~ is a comma-separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a ~flambda~ and
~no-flat-float-array~ switch:
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 5.1.0~rc3+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~rc3+options ocaml-option-flambda
ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_src

All available options can be listed with ~opam search ocaml-option~.

We'd like to have your opinion on this new one:
- Staging: https://staging.ocaml.org/docs/basic-data-types
- GitHub PR: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/1514

It addresses datatypes basic concepts. It covers the most common predefined datatypes, variants, and records.

Mutability and references are not covered, and polymorphic variants are neither (we're planning to work on these as
stand-alone tutorials).

We love feedback, we need it.
