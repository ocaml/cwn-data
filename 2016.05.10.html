Since 4.03, ocamlbuild is distributed separately from the OCaml compiler,
as announced in:
  <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2015-12/msg00003.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2015-12/msg00003.html</a>

Early-adopters have been able to use ocamlbuild 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 since
before the official 4.03 release, and the migration seems to have been
fairly smooth.

OCamlbuild 0.9.2, released on the Workers' Day, better supports
some 4.03-related options.

In particular, Martin Neuhäußer contributed new flags for flambda-specific
optimization options.
We also extend the scope of the flags -opaque and -for-pack, to align
with 4.03 best practices.

- #67: Add support for flambda's optimization parameters
  The flags are named according to the flambda options with two exceptions:
    optimization_rounds(int) for -rounds &lt;int&gt;
    optimize({2,3,classic}) for -O{2,3,classic}
  (Martin Neuhäußer)
- #70 (partial): fix hygiene complains about the build directory under
  Windows
  (Andreas Hauptmann, Gabriel Scherer)
- #73: also pass predicates(foo) to ocamldep
  (Jérémie Dimino)
- extend the scope of the -opaque flag under 4.03
  (Gabriel Scherer)
- extend the scope of the -for-pack flag to ocamlc,
  as recommend by OCaml compiler maintainers in

I am new to OCaml and wonder, whether there exists any noob-friendly
X-based IDE that is at least a bit like PyCharm. Termianl-based editors
and IDEs proved to be cumbersome and too shortcut-heavy in the past.
Has anyone seen such a beast?

I come from Python in need of more performance and already wrote some
tens of lines of code feeling that this language might be exactly what i
need to write the more performance-critical parts in (don't like C/C++).

Personally, I feel emacs is the best supported environment for
OCaml programming.

Agreed.
I have been using Merlin
<a href="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch">https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch</a>
inside emacs and found it a worthwhile addition.

You may try Atom editor with Nuclide extension (developed at Facebook for
internal uses, as I understand).
I also recommend the ocaml-indent and build extensions.

As soon as you have opam and atom installed it's as simple as:
$ opam install merlin ocamlbuild ocp-indent
$ apm install nuclide language-ocaml ocaml-indent build

Sure we have! OCaml-top [1] is very newbie friendly and work out of box, ideal
for the first steps. Even a faster way to start is to try OCaml in your web
browser [2]. Once you feel yourself more comfortable in the language, you should
consider to switch to emacs, vim or sublime. They all have a nice integration
with OCaml, including intellisense like completion, code and doc lookup and
incremental typechecking.
