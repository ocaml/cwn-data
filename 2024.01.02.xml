      <cwn_what>
Hi folks! :wave: happy to announce [castore 0.0.1](https://github.com/leostera/castore).

*tl;dr*
I'm taking a page from the Elixir community's playbook here, the ~Ca_store~ module includes an up-to-date public
certificate chain from a generally trustworthy source (eg. Mozilla) that we'll update via CI and publish
automatically to ~opam~ periodically.

*How to use it*
Easy, just ~opam install castore~ and in your ~dune-project~ make sure to use ~(castore (>= "0.0.0"))~ so you
automatically upgrade to the latest certificate.

Now you can use it with ~ocaml-tls~ and when you need that .pem file you can feed it the contents of
~Ca_store.pem~.

*Why we did this*
I was building an [HTTP client](https://github.com/leostera/blink) for [Riot](https://github.com/leostera/riot) and
realized that to support TLS I'd need to either have custom certificates or bring in ~ca-store~ and let it resolve
them from the system.

The Elixir community's approach to this is a lot simpler.

*What's missing/next*
The latest .pem file was updated on Dec 12th and I need to build the scheduled CI workflow that'll update it /
publish the lib, so if you're into crypto (maybe i can nerdsnipe @hannes?) or ci (@ulrikstrid?) then ping me :)

Happy hacking! :camel:

I spent a little time consolidating that preprocessing code into ~castore~, and
[0.0.2](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/24994) is on its way on opam.

It'll let you write this:

#+begin_src ocaml
let decode_pem ca =
  let ca = Cstruct.of_string ca in
  let cert = X509.Certificate.decode_pem ca in
  Result.get_ok cert
in
let cas = List.map decode_pem Ca_store.certificates in
let authenticator = X509.Authenticator.chain_of_trust ~time cas in
let tls_config = Tls.Config.client ~authenticator () in
(* ... *)

Heya everyone!

This weekend I had some fun and built a [fixture generator](https://codeberg.org/marcc/fixgen) in OCaml! It is my
very first DSL.

I found it very time consuming to set up test data, especially when dealing with relational data, where some data
generated needs to reference some other data. Therefore, I wanted a slim DSL that can be used to quickly generate
test data which I can import it into SQL or NoSQL.

So to give an example:

#+begin_example
~: fixgen 'user (2): id uuidv4, name name; order (5): id uuidv4, buyer user.id, amount int(1,40), currency
("USD","MXN")'

FILE NAME: user
name,id
Ivan,1aa2f650-95b2-477a-9ccf-88c46d927e4e
Judy,0bb7258f-8843-4997-97a8-08351623a9d1

FILE NAME: order
currency,amount,buyer,id

#+end_example

It can also export to JSON!

#+begin_example
~: fixgen 'user (2): id uuidv4, name name; purchase (5): id uuidv4, buyer user.id, amount int(1,40), currency
("USD","MXN")' -f json

FILE NAME: user

"57eccc5c-ad09-4229-b0c7-a828280dba1b"}]

FILE NAME: purchase
[{"currency": "USD", "amount": 14, "buyer": "f6c90f96-faad-4741-a52b-6d53b94d48f3", "id":

"amount": 17, "buyer": "f6c90f96-faad-4741-a52b-6d53b94d48f3", "id": "b15cd3d7-ede1-4612-b0f2-a36cc1a73f1c"},
{"currency": "MXN", "amount": 32, "buyer": "f6c90f96-faad-4741-a52b-6d53b94d48f3", "id":
"295a85b8-42d9-49a4-8ce6-e4d7b1a94ea9"}, {"currency": "USD", "amount": 29, "buyer":

#+end_example

For now it doesn't have many generators (I plan to add more), the docs are a bit sparse and I don't know if I
shared the compiled binary correctly. However, I wanted to share it early to gather feedback!

Hi everyone :wave:

I've been using Haskell in production for the previous 8 years. But for the last 8 months, I used OCaml at
Bloomberg.

I wrote a blog post comparing two languages from my POV:

- [Dev.to: 8 months of OCaml after 8 years of Haskell in production (by @chshersh)](https://dev.to/chshersh/8-months-of-ocaml-after-8-years-of-haskell-in-production-h96)

I tried to provide a reasonable and balanced overview of these two languages, although my experience in both is
significantly different. I hope this blog post can give a rough idea of both languages :relieved:

Enjoy! And let me know any feedback you have!

      <cwn_title>riot 0.0.7 – an actor-model multi-core scheduler for OCaml 5</cwn_title>

      <cwn_who>ostera announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Hi folks :wave: we skipped over 0.0.6 because of a CI bug, and ended up releasing Riot
[0.0.7](https://ocaml.org/p/riot/0.0.7) instead :slight_smile:

Here's a summary of the changes.

*** Single public package

The public surface of the Riot package should be limited now to the top-level `Riot` module.

*** Introduce dedicated I/O Scheduler

To improve long-tail latency when doing I/O, we're splitting out the poll loop out of the main schedulers and using
a dedicated thread for polling I/O.

*** Improved I/O primitives
The runtime now ships with an IO and a Buffer module that includes more low-level functions:
- to do vectorized reads/writes,
- await for file descriptor availability (for reading, writing, or both),
- copy data between buffers
- write buffers directly to writers

*** I/O Readers &amp; Writers
We're introducing *Reader/Writer* to build Read/Write streaming pipelines like you'd do in Rust with the
Read/Write traits.

This one is particularly exciting because we can now write super clean transformations of data that can be made
super efficient, and are tracked at the type-level, like this:

#+begin_src ocaml
let file = File.open_read "test" in (* [ `r ] File.t *)
let read = File.to_reader file in (*  [ `r ] File.t Reader.t  *)
let decrypt = Decrypt.of_reader read in (* [ `r ] File.t Decrypt.t Reader.t *)
let unzip = Unzip.of_reader read in (* [ `r ] File.t Decrypt.t Unzip.t Reader.t *)
let data (* IO.Buffer.t *) =
  let buf = IO.Buffer.with_capacity 1024 in
  let* len = IO.Reader.read unzip ~buf in
  IO.Buffer.sub buf ~len
in
(* ... *)
#+end_src
   This will pull 1024 bytes out of this stream, lazily reading backwards through the chain. And if you want it
buffered, you just gotta call. ~IO.Reader.buffered reader~ and you're good to go.

These new interfaces are available for the new File module as well as for the Net.Socket module.

Hi folks :wave: I have been willing to share Spatial Shell here for a while now, mostly because it is implemented
in OCaml so it’s a good way for me to find potential contributors ahah (unfortunately, the codebase could be more
commented tbh). [Spatial Shell](https://github.com/lthms/spatial-shell) implements a spatial model inspired by
[Material Shell](https://material-shell.com) for i3 and sway. I have very recently tagged its 6th release, and I
believe now is a good time to try and put it in the hands of other human beings. What might go wrong? :sweat_smile:

The [~README~](https://github.com/lthms/spatial-shell#spatial-shell) should be comprehensive enough to get you
started, and [I’ve also published a short blogpost](https://soap.coffee/~lthms/posts/SpatialShell6.html) giving a
bit more background on my Spatial Shell journey, and has a nice [video](https://spatial-shell.app/demo.mp4) you can
witch if you are curious.

If you run into problems while trying to test, do not hesitate to reach out ([GitHub
issues](https://github.com/lthms/spatial-shell/issues) are probably the best way to do so). I do hope Spatial Shell
becomes a usable programs for anyone interested in the workflow it enables on i3/sway deskop.
