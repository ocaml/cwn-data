FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
TFP 2005 <a href="http://www.tifp.org/tfp05">http://www.tifp.org/tfp05</a> : Sixth 
Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming,

September 23rd-24th 2005, Tallinn, Estonia 
(co-located with ICFP 2005 and GPCE 2005).

The 2005 Symposium on Trends in Functional 
Programming (TFP '05) is an international forum
for researchers with interests in all aspects of 
functional programming languages, focusing
on providing a broad view of current and future 
trends in Functional Programming.
Previous TFP symposia were held in Munich, 
Germany in 2004, in Scotland in 2002 and 2003,
as successors to the successful series of 
Scottish Functional Programming Workshops.

TFP <a href="http://www.tifp.org/">http://www.tifp.org/</a> aims to combine a 
lively environment for presenting the latest
research results with  a formal post-symposium 
refereeing process leading to the
publication by Intellect of a high-profile volume 
containing a selection of the best papers
presented at the symposium. A review of a 
previous TFP proceedings can be found in the July
2003 issue of the Journal of Functional Programming.

BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD
TFP traditionally pays special attention to 
research students, acknowledging that students
are almost by definition part of new subject 
trends. The TFP05 best student paper award
(i.e. for the best paper with a student as first 
author) acknowledges more formally the
special attention TFP has for students. The 2004 
award was given to Ron van Kesteren for
the paper entitled: "Proof Support for General Type Classes".

In order to enhance the quality of student 
submissions, student papers will be given the
option of a feedback on their submission to the 
symposium proceedings. This feedback is
intended for authors who are less familiar with a 
formal publication process and will
provide general qualitative feedback on the 
submission, but will not give a grade or
ranking.

SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM
The Symposium recognises that new trends may 
arise through various routes. As part of the
Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify 
the following five categories of paper.
High-quality papers are solicited in any of these categories:

RESEARCH PAPERS   (leading-edge, previously unpublished research work)
POSITION PAPERS   (on what new trends should or should not be)
PROJECT PAPERS    (descriptions of recently started new projects)
EVALUATION PAPERS (what lessons can be drawn from a finished project)
OVERVIEW PAPERS   (summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject)

Papers must be original, and not submitted for 
simultaneous publication in any other forum.
They may consider any aspect of functional 
programming: theoretical, implementation-
oriented, or more experience-oriented. Also 
applications of functional programming
techniques to other languages may be considered.

Papers on the following subject areas are particularly welcome:

o   functional programming and security
o   functional programming and mobility
o   functional programming applied to global computing
o   functional languages for embedded systems
o   telecommunications applications in functional languages
o   functional GRIDs
o   validation and verification of functional programs
o   functional languages for reasoning about 
imperative/object-oriented programs
o   interoperability with imperative programming languages
o   dependently typed functional programming
o   any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your paper is 
within the scope of TFP, please contact the
TFP05 program chair, Marko van Eekelen, marko@cs.ru.nl.

PROCEEDINGS
Acceptance to the symposium will be based upon 
extended abstracts of at least 6 and at most
10 pages. Accepted abstracts are to be completed 
to full papers for publication in
the proceedings that will be available at the symposium in Tallinn.

In addition, we intend to continue the TFP 
tradition of publishing a high-quality subset of
contributions in the Intellect series on Trends 
in Functional Programming.  Revised papers
will be refereed after the symposium to the 
normal standards and a subset of the best
papers over all categories will be selected for publication by Intellect.

This implies (among other things) that:

    * the paper is written in English.
    * the paper is well written.
    * the topic of the paper should be stated clearly.
    * the submission should clearly indicate to 
which paper category it belongs: a research,
      position, project, evaluation or overview 
paper; it should also indicate whether the
      paper is a student paper (i.e. first author a student).
    * for research papers, the approach to solving 
the problem should be outlined clearly
      and a detailed discussion of the solution must be given.
    * the work is properly compared with relevant related work.
    * there is an abstract, introduction and conclusion.
    * for research papers, the conclusion should 
summarise the problem, the solution, and
      how the work solves the problem.
    * papers for the symposium proceedings must 
adhere to the formatting instructions using
      the tfp.cls style, as will be provided on 
the TFP05 site; papers must not exceed 16
      pages (papers in some categories may comprise considerably less pages).
    * papers submitted for publication by 
Intellect must follow formatting and any other
      instructions provided by the Program Chair.

Papers will be judged on their contribution to 
the research area, with different criteria
applying to different categories of paper, as appropriate.

I've asked about OCaml and SOAP before on this mailing list and didn't
get a response.  As far as I can find out, there are two
possibilities, but both seem unsuitable.  OCaml-SOAP (from INRIA) -
the home page for this has disappeared in the site redesign.  O'SOAP -
seems to be all about writing command-line clients and attempts no
mapping of data types.

                                ---

    Is anyone interested in discussing writing a SOAP client
    with me, in pure OCaml, and probably based around ocamlnet
    and/or PXP?

                                ---

General plan: a tool which could take a WSDL description file and
generate OCaml stubs for functions and datatype conversions.  The
stubs would use PXP to make and parse SOAP XML, and ocamlnet to
dispatch the requests off to the server.

My personal itch is the Google Adwords API
(<a href="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/">http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/</a>).
    </pre><i>Alain Frisch answered:</i><br /><pre>
Parsing WSDL means parsing XML Schema, which is not straightforward.
Stefano Zacchiroli and I have written an approximative parser for XML 
Schema (used in CDuce); you could use it as a starting point. I'm 
currently reimplementing such a parser using my OCaml+CDuce extension
as the implementation language, and trying to follow closely the XML 
Schema spec, but I guess you won't want to switch to this experimental 
language just to parse XML Schema.

Sorry for the delay.
