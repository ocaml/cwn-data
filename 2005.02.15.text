Ah, another micro-benchmark.  Great pasttime!  

Your OCaml code is about as good as you can write.  All the unboxing
optimizations are triggered.

On x86, you can get a bit more speed with -ffast-math, which turns the
call to sqrt() into inline assembly.  As others mentioned, "-ccopt -O2"
is useless.

You don't say which Java implementation you used (there are several).
The "0.112" overhead of Java corresponds to start-up time, which includes
JIT-compilation.  As to why Java is asymptotically faster, we'd
need to look at the generated assembly code.  Good luck doing that
with a JIT compiler.

So, to understand OCaml's performances here, one has to turn to a
different baseline.  I translated your Caml code to C and looked at
gcc output.

The best gcc output is faster than the best OCaml output by about 30%.
Looking at the asm code, the main difference is that gcc keeps some
float variables (dx, dy, dz, etc) in the floating-point stack while
OCaml stores them (unboxed) to the stack.  Maybe the Java
implementation you used manages to use the float stack.  Who knows.

The x86 floating-point stack is an awfully bad match for the
register-based OCaml code generation model, so, no, I'm not going to
the great lengths the gcc folks went to extract some performance from
that model.

(Besides, being 1.3 times slower than gcc on numerical code is within
the design envelope for OCaml.  My performance goals have always been
"never more than twice as slow as C".)

On a "normal" (register-based) float architecture like PowerPC or
x86_64, the OCaml-generated code is essentially identical to the
gcc-generated one.

The C translation is attached for your amusement.

2) OCaml-HTTP 0.1.0
Archive: <http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200502/msg00279.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Stefano Zacchiroli announced:

OCaml-HTTP is an Objective Caml library freely inspired from perl's
HTTP::Daemon module that enables creation of simple HTTP daemons in
OCaml.

I just released version 0.1.0, download and more information available
at the following links:

3) String to list to string

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Juancarlo Añez asked and William D.Neumann answered:

> Why aren't there functions in the standard library to convert strings 
> to lists of characters and back?

Because a) they're not all that useful and b) they're trivial to write 
for yourself:

let explode s =
   let rec exh acc = function
   | -1 -> acc
   | i -> exh (s.[i]::acc) (pred i)
   in exh [] (pred (String.length s))

let implode l =
   let s = String.create (List.length l) in
   let rec imh i = function
   | h::t -> s.[i] <- h; imh (succ i) t
   | [] -> s
   in imh 0 l
    
** Erik de Castro Lopo replied:

Here's one thats a little more obvious (remove the function, use String.get)
and runs about 20% faster (at least on my iBook running Linux):

let string_to_charlist str =
	let rec stc lst n =
		if n < 0 then lst
		else stc ((String.get str n) :: lst) (n - 1)
	in
	stc [] ((String.length str) - 1)
	;;

To be honest, this was my second attempt. My first attempt was slower
than yours and blew the stack on million character strings (obviously
not tail rescursive). This one (and yours) is quite happy with strings 
10 times that size.
    
** Radu Grigore answered:

Yet another one:
<http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/FAQ_EXPERT-eng.html#strings>
     
** Jon Harrop suggested:

If you want succinct implementations then I'd go for:

let char_list_of_string s =
  let l = ref [] in
  String.iter (fun c -> l := c :: !l) s;
  List.rev !l

let string_of_char_list l =
  String.concat "" (List.map (String.make 1) l)
     
** Richard Jones also replied:

As others have said, these functions are not in the standard library.
However, useful functions like these[1] are available in Extlib, which
you can find here:

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocaml-lib/>

and is also available as a binary package for various platforms such
as Debian.

It contains important functions such as String.map,
String.replace_chars, String.slice, String.starts_with,
String.ends_with, and many more.

Rich.

[1] Although embarrassingly, it appears, not these exact functions,
which is why I've CC'd to ocaml-lib-devel list.  To ocaml-lib-devel:

4) Contract position in compiler development available, MSR Cambridge

Dear OCaml-list,

This is a job opportunity for an ML programmer, and may be of particular
interest to those who love compiler development for functional languages.

Thanks

Contract position in compiler development

Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK

MSR Cambridge has available a 6 month contract position in applied language
design, optimization and compiler development for work on the F# project.  F#
is a variant of the ML functional programming language with core subset
essentially compatible with the core of the OCaml language, along with a
compiler and tools for the .NET platform and Visual Studio.  It is specifically
designed to facilitate cooperation between ML code and other .NET languages
such as C# and can be downloaded from <http://research.microsoft.com/downloads> .
F# is also being used by several projects within Microsoft and Microsoft
Research.  More information on F# can be found at
<http://research.microsoft.com/projects/fsharp> .

We are looking for candidates with some or all of the following qualifications:

    * MS. or Ph.D. in Computer Science
    * Strong applied ML or functional programming skills, in Standard ML,
      OCaml, F# or Haskell.  Some experience with C++ is also required.
    * Knowledge of algorithms and techniques from compilers, including
      experience with the design and implementation of inference-based type
      systems
    * Good communication and inter-personal skills
    * Leadership and cross-team collaboration skills, including a desire to
      work with Microsoft product teams and external partners in training them
      in the use of the language and tools.
    * 2 years of industrial experience, including the ability to self-manage
      through the progressive release of stable versions of a product
    * A strong desire to ensure that mixed functional/imperative programming is
      a viable reality on the .NET platform
    * Excitement at the potential that the libraries and tools of the .NET
      Framework and Visual Studio offer to niche programming languages

This position will be tailored according to the skills of the candidate, but
will include key activities such as the following: 

- Maintaining the language and runtime infrastructure

  o Fixing bugs in the F# code base

  o Implementing new features in F#, including the Visual Studio tools for F#

  o Responding to customer feature requests

  o Improving the performance of programs compiled with F#

- Technology transfer from Microsoft Research

  o Working with key F# customers within Microsoft Research and the product
    divisions


The candidate must be willing to work in Cambridge and travel as needed to the
Seattle area and elsewhere.

Applications should be sent to Alex Reed  (alreed@microsoft.com)

F# is a contribution by Microsoft Research to ensure that a strong ML-like
symbolic programming language is available in the context of .NET.  Our group
has a good track record of positively influencing the design and implementation
of Microsoft's programming languages and platforms.  As such this position
offers the candidate the chance to make a major contribution to how future
developers write programs and to the quality of the software that we use, both
directly through ML as a language and indirectly through the research agenda of
the academic community from which it stems.
