      <cwn_what>
The benchmarks from the "Retrofitting Effect handlers to OCaml" PLDI 2022 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00250) is
available here: https://github.com/prismlab/retro-concurrency/tree/master/bench. See sections 6.2 and 6.3 in the
paper.

      <cwn_who>He later added</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I've moved the microbenchmarks alone to a separate repo: https://github.com/prismlab/retro-concurrency-bench. This
repo also contains instructions to run the docker container that runs the benchmarks from the paper with the custom
compiler variants.
