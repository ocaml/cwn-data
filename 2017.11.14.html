I'm pleased to announce the first release of LASCAr, an OCaml library for
manipulating Labeled Transition Systems.

The library provides, in particular, functions for
- building and inspecting models of such systems
- generating graphical (`.dot` format) and text (`.tex` format) representations
- computing execution trees and displaying them in graphical or text format
- computing the product (in various flavors) of such systems

Its provides implementations both for "generic" LTS (with or without state
attributes) and for "specialized" versions such as
- deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (DFA, NFA),
- Mealy and Moore automata
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)

The source code, documentation and some examples can be downloaded from GitHub at : 

<a href="https://github.com/jserot/lascar">https://github.com/jserot/lascar</a>

For a quick glance, some annotated code snippets are available here

<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jserot/lascar/blob/master/doc/examples/examples.html">http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jserot/lascar/blob/master/doc/examples/examples.html</a>

The API is documented here 

<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jserot/lascar/blob/master/doc/api/lascar.html">http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jserot/lascar/blob/master/doc/api/lascar.html</a>

Contributions are welcome since this kind of library is, due to pervasive nature
of LTS, highly extensible in many ways.
[please note that, since i’m new to GitHub, any advice on how to handle this
would be appreciated].

It is my pleasure to announce a new release of
[Tuareg](<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg</a>) which provides Emacs modes to edit
OCaml, OPAM, and jbuild files. The full changelog is below.

Happy hacking,
C.

### Changes

* Let &lt;kbd&gt;M-q&lt;/kbd&gt; reformat strings (and use only SMIE).
* Do not indent an expression after `;;` (issue #106).
* New face `tuareg-font-double-colon-face` to highlight `;;`.
* For `type … and …`, left-align `and` with `type`.
* Fix indentation of some GADT type definitions.
* Use `prettify-symbols-mode` to turn `+.` into `∔`,… and add a menu
  entry to toggle it.
* Properly indent `type 'a foo = 'a bla = …` (issue #98).
* Properly indent (issue #7):

        module … with module X = Z
                  and type t := C.t

* Support `let exception E in expr` (issue #102).
* Improved highlighting of `val` and `module` in first class module
  expressions.
* Warn if a file inside a `_build` is edited and propose to switch.
* Add a custom face `tuareg-font-lock-label-face` for labels.
* Add option `tuareg-match-patterns-aligned` to allow to choose
  between the two styles:

        function          v.s.        function
        | A                           | A
          | B -&gt; ...                  | B -&gt; ...
        | C -&gt; ...                    | C -&gt; ... "

* Highlight attributes and extension nodes.
* Disable by default and improve the compilation advice—see the new
  variable `tuareg-opam-insinuate` (issue #97).
* New keybinding &lt;kbd&gt;C-cC-w&lt;/kbd&gt; and function `tuareg-opam-update-env`
  to update the environment to an opam switch (offering completion).
* Improved highlighting of quoted strings `{|…|}` (issue #89).
* Move after `;;` when evaluating a phrase in the toploop (issue #96).

* ocamldebug:
  - Add support for `completion-at-point`.
  - Highlight the right location even in presence of non-ascii chars
	(issue #80).
  - Make possible to pass argument to ocamldebug (say, paths with `-I`).
  - Make possible to pass argument to the program being debugged (issue #66).
  - Warn if SMIE is disabled.

* New modes `tuareg-jbuild` and `tuareg-opam` with syntax
  highlighting, indentation, and skeletons.

We have observed that some of our binaries have grown in size over several
releases and I'd like to find out what are the biggest contributors to this. I'd
be grateful for recommendations how best to do this: can the compiler or linker
be made to emit informations, or is it better to analyse the binary with
something like nm(1). Obviously I can take a look at library files before
linking but it seems a bit tedious to me and I don't know how much the linker
actually selects.
      </pre><i>Hannes Mehnert replied:</i><br /><pre>
Some time ago I had the same interest (and still have). I have implemented an
overproximation (by hooking into the link step of `ocamlbuild`, and gathering
the byte sizes of all linked libraries). This is available
[here](<a href="https://gist.github.com/hannesm/c8a9b2e75bb4f98b5100a838ea125f3b">https://gist.github.com/hannesm/c8a9b2e75bb4f98b5100a838ea125f3b</a>). I also
wrote some text about the results over in [my
blog](<a href="https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/BottomUp">https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/BottomUp</a>). This will obviously need some
adaption for the jbuilder area. I also didn't so far find enough time to
upstream this analysis into the mirage utility (or make it more standalone).

I'd also be really interested to have a way coming from the binary, using
objdump/nm to find the function names and sizes, and then some heuristics which
puts function names into library buckets. Especially to see the comparison in
terms of bytes of the results.
      </pre><i>Christian Lindig then said:</i><br /><pre>
Looking at output from nm(1), the code for each module is marked:

```
: ring3tools $ nm -n logfreq.native | egrep '_code_begin|_code_end' | head
000000000002e500 T caml_startup__code_begin
0000000000030fd4 T caml_startup__code_end
0000000000030fe0 T camlStd_exit__code_begin
000000000003100d T camlStd_exit__code_end
0000000000031010 T camlLogfreq__code_begin
0000000000031fca T camlLogfreq__code_end
0000000000031fd0 T camlUnix__code_begin
0000000000037443 T camlUnix__code_end
0000000000037450 T camlUnixLabels__code_begin
0000000000037ccc T camlUnixLabels__code_end
```

While this does not account for space taken up for data, it could be a good
approximation.

In the MirageOS organization, we have many repositories that have lots of old
and no-longer-relevant issues in them (some have even been fixed!) as well as
issues that haven't gotten a reply yet from a maintainer. In preparation for the
upcoming hack retreat (starting on 29th November), when more eyes are on obscure
corners of the Mirage ecosystem than usual, I think it would be nice to take a
day and do some housecleaning.

On Friday, 17th November (a week from now), @hannes, @djs55, and I will be going
through old issues and coordinating our efforts on the #mirage channel over on
irc.freenode.net (the same venue as our biweekly catchups). I expect there to be
the most activity during the afternoon UTC and maybe a bit later, but don't feel
limited to that timeslot -- if you're familiar with a repository and have a bit
of time, we'd love your help any time at all. Please do join us if you're free!

If you're not sure where to start, here's a link to a GitHub search for all
issues in repositories owned by the Mirage organization which are open and not
archived, sorted with the least recently updated first, for your editing and
browsing pleasure:

I am pleased to announce a new release of ProVerif, version 1.97pl3.
ProVerif is a automatic security protocol verifier that relies on the symbolic
model of cryptography.

ProVerif is available at
   <a href="http://proverif.inria.fr">http://proverif.inria.fr</a>
It is also available via opam. If you use opam, you can install it by:
   opam install proverif
(You may need to do "opam update" before, to get the latest version.)
This release is mainly a bug fix release.

Recent changes:

Version 1.97pl3

- Modified the code so that it is compatible with OCaml 4.06

Version 1.97pl2

- Fixed bug that could cause an internal error in trace reconstruction,
  when a message was received of a type different from the one expected
  by the input.
- Fixed bug that happened when "sync" was under a process macro.
  It could lead to unbound variables, causing an internal error.

Interested in contributing to OCaml as part of the team that created it?

The Gallium project-team at Inria Paris (<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/">http://gallium.inria.fr/</a>) is
opening a post-doctoral position to work on the OCaml language and
core system.

The position is part of the SecurOCaml project
(<a href="http://ocamlpro.github.io/SecurOCaml/">http://ocamlpro.github.io/SecurOCaml/</a>) and aims at improving the
usability and reliability of OCaml for the development of
high-assurance applications.  

In this context, a broad variety of OCaml-related research topics can
be considered depending on the expertise of the post-doctoral
scientist.  Theory-oriented topics will be considered but more
practically-oriented topics such as tool development and short-term
improvements to the OCaml system are especially welcome.

The position can start as early as February 2018 and extends until
June 2019, with a possible extension to December 2019.

The candidate should have a PhD, prior experience in the design and
implementation of functional programming languages, and a solid
experience in developing advanced software in OCaml.

To apply, send your curriculum vitae (including software portfolio and
names of references) to Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr.

It is my pleasure to announce statmemprof, a statistical memory profiler
for OCaml. This tool will help you better understand the memory
consumption of your programs and find memory leaks. It can be tuned to
have little overhead (as low as &lt; 1%) while still gathering useful
information.

This tool can already be installed via opam:
$ opam switch 4.06.0+statistical-memprof  #The switch also exists for 4.03.0 and 4.05.0.
$ opam install statmemprof-emacs

Then, instructions for using it can be found be reading the

a preliminary stage of development. I would be very happy to get your
comments to help me understand what would be the most useful improvements.
