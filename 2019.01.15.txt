  The dune team is pleased to announce the bug fix release of Dune
  1.6.3. Normally, we don't bother announcing all bug fix releases, but
  this one contains quite a few fixes. I'd like to take this opportunity
  to encourage everyone to upgrade. Cheers.


1.6.3 (08/01/2019)
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Fix merlin handling of private module visibility (#1653 @bobot)

  • skip directories when looking up programs in the PATH (#1628, fixes
    #1616, @diml)

  • Fix preprocessing for libraries with `(include_subdirs ..)' (#1624,
    fix #1626, @nojb, @rgrinberg)

  • Do not generate targets for archive that don't match the `modes'
    field. (#1632, fix #1617, @rgrinberg)

  • When executing actions, open files lazily and close them as soon as
    possible in order to reduce the maximum number of file descriptors
    opened by Dune (#1635, #1643, fixes #1633, @jonludlam, @rgrinberg,
    @diml)

  • Do not generate targets for archive that don't match the `modes'

  • Get the correct environment node for multi project workspaces
    (#1648, @rgrinberg)

  • Fix an issue causing menhir generated parsers to fail to build in
    some cases. The fix is to systematically use `-short-paths' when
    calling `ocamlc -i' (#1743, fix #1504, @diml)
