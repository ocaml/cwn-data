      <cwn_title>GSoC: call for students</cwn_title>
      <cwn_who>Christophe TROESTLER announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The "OCaml community" application to the Google summer of code has
been sent.  In about a week we will know whether we are accepted or
not.

On behalf of the Admin team, I would like to thank everybody who as
accepted to become a possible mentor.  The call is still open, if you
think you would be a good mentor, please create an account and add
your name on http://gsoc-team.forge.ocamlcore.org/

More ideas can also be added to
http://gsoc-team.forge.ocamlcore.org/GSoC2011/Applying

To all of you who are in contact with students, please let them know
about the opportunity to have fun coding OCaml during their holidays!
Encourage them to add their name on
http://gsoc-team.forge.ocamlcore.org/ and to look at the ideas page
http://gsoc-team.forge.ocamlcore.org/GSoC2011/Applying

Now is a good time for the students to start interacting with the
community.

Best, Christophe
