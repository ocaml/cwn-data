Note that you can, to a certain degree, build your own flat structures with the ~Bytes~
module. Compared to bigarrays, ~Bytes.t~ has less indirection, a lower constant memory
overhead and can be allocated on the minor heap. The contents of ~Bytes.t~ are not scanned by
the GC, just like bigarrays.

For example, a more efficient ~int32 Array.t~:

#+begin_src ocaml
module Int32_array : sig
  type t
  val equal : t -> t -> bool
  val create : int -> t
  val length : t -> int
  val get : t -> int -> int32
  val set : t -> int -> int32 -> unit
  val sub : t -> int -> int -> t
  val to_list : bytes -> int32 list
end = struct
  type t = Bytes.t
  let equal = Bytes.equal
  let create len = Bytes.create (4 * len)
  let length t = Bytes.length t / 4
  let get t i = Bytes.get_int32_le t (4 * i)
  let set t i x = Bytes.set_int32_le t (4 * i) x
  let sub t pos len = Bytes.sub t (4 * pos) (4 * len)
  let to_list t = List.init (length t) (get t)
end
#+end_src

A more efficient ~(int * int)~:

#+begin_src ocaml
module Point : sig
  type t
  val create : int -> int -> t
  val x : t -> int
  val y : t -> int
end = struct
  external get_int64_unsafe : bytes -> int -> int64 = "%caml_bytes_get64u"
  external set_int64_unsafe : bytes -> int -> int64 -> unit = "%caml_bytes_set64u"
  type t = Bytes.t
  let create x y =
    let p = Bytes.create 16 in
    set_int64_unsafe p 0 (Int64.of_int x);
    set_int64_unsafe p 8 (Int64.of_int y);
    p
  let x t = Int64.to_int (get_int64_unsafe t 0)
  let y t = Int64.to_int (get_int64_unsafe t 8)
end
#+end_src

(making a more efficient ~(int * int) Array.t~ is left as an exercise to the reader)

The downside compared to bigarrays is that it doesn't support ~sub~ without copying. Also,
bytes can be moved by the GC (during minor GCs or compaction), and therefore you cannot
release the runtime lock when passing them to C. The latter point is less relevant with the
multicore extensions, especially since there is no compactor yet. There is some related
discussion on the eio repository: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues/140

      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dkml-c-probe-2-0-0-cross-compiler-friendly-definitions-for-c-compiling/9950/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>jbeckford announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Summary: dkml-c-probe is a new package for maintainers who compile or link C code. Install it
with ~opam install dkml-c-probe~. Full docs are at
[https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-c-probe#readme](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-c-probe#readme)

*** Problem

You are creating an OCaml package that has foreign C code. Perhaps you need special C headers
or libraries when you are targeting Apple users, or perhaps you need to execute custom OCaml
code for Android users. More generally you need a way to determine whether your OCaml or C
code is compiling for a Linux AMD/Intel 64-bit, Android ARM 32-bit, or any other ABI target.

*** Solution
A user of your OCaml package may, for example, be on a 64-bit AMD/Intel Linux machine using a
32-bit OCaml system compiled with ~gcc -m32~; additionally they have a 32-bit Android ARM
cross-compiler toolchain. ~dkml-c-probe~ will tell you the target operating system is ~Linux~
and the target ABI is ~Linux_x86~ except when the cross-compiler toolchain is invoked. With
the cross-compiler toolchain ~dkml-c-probe~ will tell you the target operating system is
~Android~ and the target ABI is ~Android_arm32v7a~.

*** How it works

~dkml-c-probe~ uses C preprocessor definitions (ex. ~#if TARGET_CPU_X86_64~, ~#if
__ANDROID__~, etc.) to determine which ABI the C compiler (ex. ~ocamlopt -config | grep
native_c_compiler~) is targeting.

This isn't a new idea. The pattern is used in Esy and Mirage code as well. ~dkml-c-probe~
just codifies the pattern for use in your own code.

*** Usage

In OCaml code you can use the /versioned/ module:

#+begin_src ocaml
module V2 :
  sig
    type t_os = Android | IOS | Linux | OSX | Windows
    type t_abi =
        Android_arm64v8a
      | Android_arm32v7a
      | Android_x86
      | Android_x86_64
      | Darwin_arm64
      | Darwin_x86_64
      | Linux_arm64
      | Linux_arm32v6
      | Linux_arm32v7
      | Linux_x86_64
      | Linux_x86
      | Windows_x86_64
      | Windows_x86
      | Windows_arm64
      | Windows_arm32
    val get_os : (t_os, Rresult.R.msg) result Lazy.t
    val get_abi : (t_abi, Rresult.R.msg) result Lazy.t
    val get_abi_name : (string, Rresult.R.msg) result Lazy.t
  end
#+end_src

In C code you can use the [provided ~dkml_compiler_probe.h~
header](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-c-probe#c-header) from within Dune or Opam. Here is a
snippet that handles part of the Linux introspection:

#+begin_src c
#elif __linux__
#   if __ANDROID__
#       ...
#   else
#       define DKML_OS_NAME "Linux"
#       define DKML_OS_Linux
#       if __aarch64__
#           define DKML_ABI "linux_arm64"
#           define DKML_ABI_linux_arm64
#       elif __arm__
#           if defined(__ARM_ARCH_6__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_6J__) ||
defined(__ARM_ARCH_6K__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_6Z__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_6ZK__) ||
defined(__ARM_ARCH_6T2__)
#               define DKML_ABI "linux_arm32v6"
#               define DKML_ABI_linux_arm32v6
#           elif defined(__ARM_ARCH_7__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_7A__) ||
defined(__ARM_ARCH_7R__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_7M__) || defined(__ARM_ARCH_7S__)
#               define DKML_ABI "linux_arm32v7"
#               define DKML_ABI_linux_arm32v7
#           endif /* __ARM_ARCH_6__ || ...,  __ARM_ARCH_7__ || ... */
#       elif __x86_64__
#           define DKML_ABI "linux_x86_64"
#           define DKML_ABI_linux_x86_64
#       elif __i386__
#           define DKML_ABI "linux_x86"
#           define DKML_ABI_linux_x86
#       elif defined(__ppc64__) || defined(__PPC64__)
#           define DKML_ABI "linux_ppc64"
#           define DKML_ABI_linux_ppc64
#       elif __s390x__
#           define DKML_ABI "linux_s390x"
#           define DKML_ABI_linux_s390x
#       endif /* __aarch64__, __arm__, __x86_64__, __i386__, __ppc64__ || __PPC64__,
__s390x__ */
#+end_src

*** Versioning and Contributing

Whenever a new ABI is added, it goes into a new version (ex. ~module V3~). Your existing code
that uses ~module V2~ will be unaffected.

But each new ABI needs to have its own maintainer because I don't have access to every
hardware platform on the planet!

For example, PowerPC (~ppc64~) and Linux on IBM Z (~s390x~) are supported in the C Header but
not the OCaml module because there are no PowerPC and S390x maintainers.

Please consider contributing, especially if you want others to have an easier compilation
story for your favorite hardware platform.

      <cwn_what>
Hi everyone! Iâ€™ve written a tutorial blog series about full-stack web development in OCaml,
and wanted to share it here.

Last semester, I took Penn State's [CMPSC
431W](https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/cmpsc/#:~:text=CMPSC%20431W%3A%20Database%20Management%20Systems),
where our final project was to build a database-driven web application. Since I'm fairly
familiar with web programming through my work on [Flarum](https://flarum.org/) and past
internships/side projects, I decided to use this opportunity to explore the OCaml web
development ecosystem. I used [Dream](https://aantron.github.io/dream/) for the backend, and
[Bonsai](https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai) for the frontend.

While working on this project, I realized two things:

- OCaml is very underrated for web development. In addition to all the languageâ€™s great features and safety guarantees, the ecosystem is pretty good! Dream near-perfectly coincides with my vision of backend webdev, and Bonsai has a great balance of flexibility/elegance and safety.
- I couldnâ€™t find realistic but accessible full-stack web projects in OCaml available for reference. I found [tutorials](https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti) for [bits](https://jsthomas.github.io/ocaml-dream-api.html) and [pieces](https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai/blob/master/docs/getting_started/counters.mdx), but nothing that connected all the dots.

I really enjoyed writing an article series on [hardware design with
OCaml](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/hardcaml-mips-cpu-learning-project-and-blog/8088), so I
decided to do so for web development as well. In total, I wrote 7 articles that walk through
my projectâ€™s:

1. [Full-Stack WebDev in OCaml Intro](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/26-1x-full-stack-webdev-in-ocaml-intro). This includes some background on the project, and instructions for accessing the [live demo](https://cmpsc431.ceramichacker.com/).
2. [Backend WebDev w/ Dream and Caqti](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/28-2x-backend-webdev-w-dream-and-caqti).
3. [Building GraphQL APIs with Dream](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/29-3x-building-graphql-apis-with-dream)
4. [Setting up Bonsai](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/30-4x-setting-up-bonsai).
5. [Understanding Bonsai](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/31-5x-understanding-bonsai). I actually wrote the first draft of this before I decided to do a blog, while trying to, well, understand Bonsai. It goes over some underlying concepts (SPAs, Frontend State Management, Algebraic Effects, Monads), as well as Bonsaiâ€™s core design.
6. [Using GraphQL in Bonsai](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/32-6x-using-graphql-in-bonsai).
7. [Routing in Bonsai and Project Conclusion](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/33-77-routing-in-bonsai-and-project-conclusion).

Additionally, the [projectâ€™s README](https://github.com/askvortsov1/nittany_market) has a
comprehensive overview of the tech stack, folder structure, and usage instructions. It also
includes some reflections on design decisions and my experience working with these libraries.

I had a lot of fun writing these, and I hope theyâ€™re useful to anyone considering OCaml for
web development. Would be happy to answer any questions or comments.

People who are looking for more lightweight alternatives â€“ and want to do web programming without bothering too much about front end insanity can have a look at
[hc](https://erratique.ch/software/hc) (yes indeed: sending HTML over ~fetch~, web programming excels at running in circles).

The front JavaScript for that [CRUD webapp](https://github.com/dbuenzli/hyperbib) comes out at 132Ko uncompressed without even trying to tweak anything.

      <cwn_title>Sketch.sh now supports multiple compiler versions, starting with 4.13.1</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-sketch-sh-now-supports-multiple-compiler-versions-starting-with-4-13-1/9971/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Javier ChÃ¡varri announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The interactive OCaml sketchbook [sketch.sh](https://sketch.sh/) has now support to store,
edit and run sketches in different versions of the OCaml compiler.

*** Support for 4.13

Storing and running sketches using the compiler version 4.13.1 is now possible, this
functionality has been added to the already existing support for version 4.06.1. The Reason
parser and formatting tool refmt were also updated to a more recent version that supports
4.13.1.

Here you can see a sketch showcasing the monadic let syntax, using the example from the
official OCaml docs: [ZipSeq - Sketch.sh](https://sketch.sh/s/8cnNChTTq6IoGeFQarbvN2/).

*** Existing sketches and forks

Previously existing sketches remain in 4.06.1, while newly created sketches will be on
4.13.1. For now, the only way to "migrate" a sketch to the newer version of the compiler is
by copying its content and pasting it in a new sketch.

Forked sketches inherit the compiler version of the forked sketch.

*** Future plans

In the future, there are plans to support version 4.14.0 of the compiler, and we are
considering adding a way so that the version of the compiler can be chosen for a given
sketch. We are also working on migrating the editor UI codebase to a more recent version of
ReasonReact, and use JSX3 instead of JSX2.

*** Feature requests and bugs

Please [let us know](https://github.com/Sketch-sh/sketch-sh/issues/new) in case you have a
feature request, or if you encounter any issues or bugs. Also, don't hesitate to reach out
via DM or any other means if you would like to contribute or participate in the project in
some way.

Thanks to [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) for supporting an Open Source Day initiative, which
allowed to allocate time to work on this improvement for sketch.sh, and for providing the
infrastructure to run the sketch.sh service for the community. Thanks as well to the authors
and maintainers of the OCaml compiler, js_of_ocaml, and ReScript, that sketch.sh relies upon.

      <cwn_title>Explicit type binding and mutual recursion</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/explicit-type-binding-and-mutual-recursion/9973/3</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Deep in this thread, octachron explained</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
For most use cases, if you want an explicit annotation for recursive function, it will be
much simpler to use the ~type a. ...~ form:
#+begin_src ocaml
let rec foo: type a. a -> a = fun x -> x
and bar: type a. a -> a = fun x -> foo x
#+end_src
This form is a shortcut for both adding an explicit universal quantified and and a
corresponding locally abstract type (in other words ~let f :  'a . .... = fun (type a) -> ... ~).

The root issue with

#+begin_src ocaml
let rec f (type a) (x:a) = f x
#+end_src
is that the locally abstract type ~a~ is introduced after ~f~. Moreover, without an explicit
type annotation, a recursive function like ~f~ is monomorphic in its body and a monorphic
function cannot be called on a type that was defined after the function.

In other words, the issue is that in term of type scopes, the function ~f~ is equivalent to
#+begin_src ocaml
let f = ref Fun.id
type t = A
let x = !f A
#+end_src
which also fails with
#+begin_example
Error: This expression has type t but an expression was expected of type 'a
       The type constructor t would escape its scope
#+end_example
This is why the second solution proposed by @Gopiandcode  works. Indeed, in

#+begin_src ocaml
let foo, bar = fun (type a) ->
  let rec foo (x: a) : a = x
  and bar (x: a) : a = foo x in
  foo, bar
#+end_src
the type ~a~ is defined before the recursive functions ~foo~ and ~bar~, thus ~foo a~ does not
break any scope constraint.
