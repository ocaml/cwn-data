      <cwn_what>
Would anyone have an example I could look at of a homebrew "formula" for an OCaml program? I'm looking to
distribute an executable to colleagues who are not OCaml users.

(There seem to be lots of moving parts and I'm not sure which one has stopped moving!).

Many thanks.

      <cwn_title>v0.16 release of Jane Street packages</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-v0-16-release-of-jane-street-packages/12398/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Diana Kalinichenko announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Dear OCaml developers,

We are pleased to announce the v0.16 release of Jane Street packages!

This release comes with 34 new packages and a plethora of new features, fixes, and enhancements.

The remainder of this post highlights the main changes since the v0.15
release.

*** Release-wide changes

**** Switch to OCaml 4.14

We are switching Base and all our packages, except sexplib0, to OCaml 4.14 and above.

Previously, Base supported the four latest OCaml versions. The prime reason for it was to ensure that a single
ppxlib release would work across multiple compilers. However, ppxlib now depends solely on sexplib0, not Base.

Meanwhile, we are making a considerable effort to integrate the latest OCaml features. We've already added features
like the ~In_channel~ module from the 4.14 standard library to Base, and we’re working on switching to the 5.0
compiler internally.

As a result, we decided to remove the strict requirement for Base's backward compatibility. Instead, we hope to
provide a more comprehensive Stdlib replacement and better testing for recent compiler versions. We plan to
eventually add support for OCaml 5 primitives in Base, starting with releases v0.17 or v0.18.

**** 32-bit platform support

As stated [previously](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/jane-street-packages-dropping-support-for-32-bit/8621), we are
no longer testing on 32-bit platforms. That said, we expect that our packages will mostly continue to function on
32-bit, and we strive to maintain compatibility. In particular, we will keep responding to bug reports and
accepting 32-bit compatibility patches. We’re also hoping that Tarides’ work in this area will improve the testing
of our packages across many platforms, including 32-bit bytecode.

**** Deprecation of ~Caml~ in favor of ~Stdlib~

We are deprecating our ~Caml~ alias for the OCaml standard library, in favor of using the default module, ~Stdlib~.
This allows writing code that references the standard library regardless of whether Base is opened or not.

**** Local allocations

We’ve included annotations for local allocations in our public release code; however, these annotations are not
recognized by the stock OCaml compiler. More information on local allocations can be found in our blog post at
https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-locality/.

For those interested in experimenting with local allocations, our OCaml fork with local allocation support can be
found [here](https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/ocaml-jst). Please be aware that this is highly experimental and not
guaranteed to function outside of Jane Street.

*** Future plans

**** Shadowing ~Stdlib~

We plan to stop shadowing Stdlib in Base. We also plan to add a flag to Dune to enable ~-nopervasives~ during
compilation, which prevents ~Stdlib~ from being opened automatically. The previous practice of shadowing Stdlib in
Base has caused issues, and we hope this new approach will prove more resilient.

**** OCaml extensions

We intend to create an experimental Opam repository with our internal compiler for a more straightforward setup.
This will allow users to experiment with our new language extensions before they are integrated into mainstream
OCaml.

At present, we convert our native syntax for OCaml extensions into annotations. However, once we transition to the
experimental repo, we will release the unmodified code featuring the preferred ~local_~ syntax.

*** Many, many other changes

Since our last release, we have focused on delivering improved changelogs for our users, and we plan to maintain
these efforts moving forward. Most of our libraries now include changelog files that outline changes since the
v0.15 release. Browse [our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/janestreet) and access the respective
~CHANGES.md~ files for more information.

For examples, see changelogs for [Base](https://github.com/janestreet/base/blob/master/CHANGES.md),
[Async_kernel](https://github.com/janestreet/async_kernel/blob/master/CHANGES.md), and

      <cwn_who>François Pottier announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Dear users of Menhir,

I am happy to announce a new release of Menhir, with several minor changes and bug fixes, listed below.

#+begin_example

  opam upgrade menhir
#+end_example

Happy parsing,
François Pottier

*** 2023/06/08

- The new command line switch ~--dump-menhirLib &lt;directory&gt;~ causes the source
  files ~menhirLib.ml~ and ~menhirLib.mli~ to be created in the designated
  directory. This command can be useful to users with special needs who wish
  to use ~menhirLib~ but do not want to rely on it being installed somewhere
  in the file system. (Contributed by Nicolás Ojeda Bär.)
- Changes in the public API of the library ~MenhirSdk~.
  (Contributed by Frédéric Bour.)
  + The function ~Lr1.reductions~,
    whose type is ~t -> (terminal * production list) list~,
    is still present but is now deprecated.
    The function ~Lr1.get_reductions~,
    whose type is ~t -> (terminal * production) list~,
    should be used instead.
    The library offers a view of the automaton after conflict resolution,
    so, for each token, at most one production can be reduced.
  + The function ~Lr1.default_reduction : Lr1.t -> production option~
    appears. This function indicates which states have a default reduction.
  + The function ~Cmly_read.read_channel~ appears.
  + The module ~Cmly_read.Lift~ appears.
- The new experimental flag ~--specialize-token~ causes the code back-end
  to perform code specialization so as to guarantee that each token is
  examined exactly once (thus never more than once) by the parser. This
  causes an increase in code size and does not (yet) allow a performance
  increase. This feature is independent of the choice between ~-O 0~,
  ~-O 1~ and ~-O 2~. It may disappear in the future.
- Inconsistent type definitions used to be produced when ~--only-tokens~ and
  ~--inspection~ were passed on the command line. The type ~terminal~ was
  defined at the toplevel, whereas it should always be defined inside the
  submodule ~MenhirInterpreter~. (Reported and fixed by Frédéric Bour.)
- Malformed code and type definitions used to be produced when
  ~--external-tokens~ and ~--inspection~ were passed on the command line.
  Fixed. (Reported by Maxime Dénès.)
- Enable OCaml warning 39 (unused rec flag) in the OCaml code produced
  by Menhir's code back-end. Menhir now carefully emits ~let~ instead
  of ~let rec~ when a function is not recursive.

Dear OCaml users,

I am currently working with the OCaml.org maintainers on improving the blog section of the OCaml.org website.
Specifically, I am adding filters that enable you to quickly find relevant articles from the OCaml community.

To make this feature truly useful, it is essential that we add relevant and useful tags to the blog posts. I would
like to hear your feedback on which specific tags you would like to see.

Your opinion is very important to us. Here are some ideas for possible tags/filters:
- By authors
- Industry vs Personal blog / kind of blog source
- relating to libraries and packages
...

Feel free to add your own tag suggestions or comment on those that have already been proposed. Which filters are
most important to you?
Your feedback will help us improve the search experience and make ocaml.org more user-friendly for everyone.

Thank you in advance for your participation and contribution!

      <cwn_who>Thibaut Mattio announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Welcome to the second issue of the OCaml Platform newsletter!

We're excited to share the work we've done in May on improving OCaml developer experience with the [OCaml
Platform](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform). Similar to the [previous
update](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-platform-newsletter-april-2023/12187), this issue is structured around
the development workflow we're currently exploring or improving.

The highlight of this month is the publication of the [work-in-progress roadmap for the OCaml
Platform](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-roadmap-for-the-ocaml-platform-seeking-your-feedback/12238). We published
it to start gathering community feedback on the Design Principles and Persona of the Platform. The feedback will be
used to establish our plans for the next three years. We've received tons of very insightful and constructive
feedback already, and in the coming weeks and months, we'll revise the roadmap based on that feedback. As a next
step, we'll share the first version of the proposed developer workflows.

Another important milestone this month is the release of [Dune
3.8](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/releases/tag/3.8.0). The release comes with support for compiling OCaml projects
to JavaScript using Melange, which has seen its [first stable
release](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-melange-1-0-compile-ocaml-reasonml-to-javascript/12305) this month! It
also contains several important features and improvements that have been in the work for some time, like the new
~concurrent~ action and the composition of Coq rules.

As a last highlight, the first alpha of opam 2.2 is getting very close. There were some unexpected issues while
preparing the release this month, but the opam team is still aiming for a release in June.

There's a lot of other very exciting work to talk about, so let's delve into it!

*** Building Packages

**** *Dune* Exploring Package Management in Dune

Contributors: @rgrinberg (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV (Tarides), @gridbugs (Tarides), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides)

Explorations continue on adding package management support to Dune. This month progress has been made on several
fronts:

- The work on the solver has been started, including vendoring the opam-0install solver for solving dependencies when generating Dune lockfiles. A work-in-progress implementation of lockfile generation is available on the ~main~ branch.
- The source tree handling has undergone a refactor to eventually allow multiple context-specific lockfiles.
- The source fetching implementation has seen improvements, including checksum handling and a better Fetch API. This results in a cleaner interface for building opam packages.
- Work continues on prototyping the building of opam packages, which includes the addition of new ~Patch~ and ~Substitute~ actions. This has increased the subset of opam packages that can now be built.

*Activities:*
- Merged the PR that added the ability to build opam packages -- [ocaml/dune#7626](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7626).

- Carried out a refactor to allow passing in a custom runner to ~OpamStd.Sys~ -- [ocaml/dune#5549](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5549).

**** *opam* Native Support for Windows in opam 2.2

Contributors: @rjbou (OCamlPro), @kit-ty-kate (Tarides), @dra27 (Tarides), @emillon (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV
(Tarides)

Throughout May, the opam team has focused on reviewing and fixing remaining PRs for the 2.2 alpha release. This
effort debugged and resolved issues found during testing, and the team is now working through the handful PRs
pending review.

A new release, opam 2.1.5 point release, has also been rolled out, backporting several fixes from the upcoming 2.2
release, and an important security fix. You can read the announcement on the [OCaml
Changelog](https://ocaml.org/changelog?t=opam).

**** *Dune* Improving Dune's Documentation

Contributors: @emillon (Tarides)

Two Dune libraries now have a documentation page on OCaml.org: both
[dune-build-info](https://ocaml.org/p/dune-build-info/latest/doc/index.html) and
[dune-configurator](https://ocaml.org/p/dune-configurator/latest/doc/index.html) now have their API documentation
directly on their package page, and for Dune itself, a link to its official documentation has been included.

A new ~action:~ directive has been added to the Dune Sphinx domain, allowing for improved cross-referencing.
Finally, the old ~.org~ format Dune example docs have been converted to Markdown to standardize the documentation
format further.

The improvements to the documentation have been published as part of the Dune 3.8 release. The new structure and
many improvements can be viewed on [Dune documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

*Activities:*
- Placed uncategorized pages under the most appropriate header -- [ocaml/dune#7683](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7683).
- Converted README.org in example to markdown -- [ocaml/dune#7738](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7738).
- Added API documentation for dune-build-info -- [ocaml/dune#7739](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7739).
- Directed readers to the official docs in odoc -- [ocaml/dune#7746](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7746).
- Added an odoc index for configurator -- [ocaml/dune#7749](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7749).
- Corrected the documentation for ~(map_workspace_root)~ -- [ocaml/dune#7775](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7775).
- Expanded actions documentation with a special directive -- [ocaml/dune#7804](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7804).

**** *Dune* Composing installed Coq theories

Contributors: @Alizter and @ejgallego (IRIF)

Last month, the PR that brings [support for composing Coq theories with
Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7047) was merged.

This is now available in the release of Dune 3.8.0! From this point onwards, Coq users can utilize Dune to build

**** *Dune* Running Actions Concurrently

Contributors: @Alizter and @hhugo (Nomadic Labs)

Last month, a couple of PRs were merged into Dune to [add a new concurrent
action](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/6933) and it was utilized to [run inline tests
concurrently](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7012).

These patches are part of Dune 3.8.0 release, starting now, you can use the new ~concurrent~ action in your Dune
rules:

#+begin_example
(rule
 (action
  (concurrent
   (run &lt;prog&gt; &lt;args&gt;)
   (run &lt;prog&gt; &lt;args&gt;))))
#+end_example

**** *Dune* Benchmarking Dune on Large Code Bases

Contributors: @gridbugs (Tarides), @Leonidas-from-XIV (Tarides)

The quality of the dune benchmark results has been improved, averaging out the variance seen in short tests by
running them multiple times. This enhancement aims to reduce the effect of the background noise inherent in the
environment.

The dune benchmarks also exposed two broken packages: the hash of [ppx_rapper
(3.1.0)](https://ocaml.org/p/ppx_rapper/3.1.0) artefact has been updated as it had changed in place, and
[ocamlcodoc](https://ocaml.org/p/ocamlcodoc/latest) artefacts have been added to the
[opam-source-archives](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-source-archives) as the original URL is no longer reachable.

Moreover, a stack overflow in ~dune-rpc-lwt~ exposed by the benchmarks has been fixed.

*** Compiling to JavaScript

**** *Dune* Compile to JavaScript with Melange in Dune

Contributors: @anmonteiro, @jchavarri (Ahrefs), @rgrinberg (Tarides)

We're thrilled to see the joint release of Dune 3.8.0 and [Melange
1.0](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-melange-1-0-compile-ocaml-reasonml-to-javascript/12305) this month!

[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange) is a compiler from OCaml to JavaScript with the vision of
maintaining compatibility with OCaml and providing the best OCaml experience within the modern JavaScript
ecosystem.

Have a look at the [Dune documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/melange.html) and [Melange
documentation](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/) to learn how to get started using Melange to compile your OCaml projects
to JavaScript.

You can also refer to the [template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template) to get started.

*** Generating Documentation

**** *Odoc* Add Search Capabilities to ~odoc~

Contributors: @panglesd (Tarides), @EmileTrotignon (Tarides), @trefis (Tarides)

The odoc team is making steady progress on adding a search bar to odoc's generated documentation.

In May, an interface for interaction between odoc and search engines was designed.
[Sherlodoc](https://doc.sherlocode.com/), which can now run in the browser, was updated to use the new interface
exposed by odoc. Improvements were also made to ~sherlodoc~ itself to enable searching for constructors and record
fields, as well as in docstrings. The larger database from all this extra indexing prompted work on profiling it
and implementing optimizations.

Anticipating the June update, the [odoc PR](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/972) that was open a few days ago
can be checked out.

In parallel, a [working prototype](https://github.com/panglesd/odoc/tree/occurrences-in-odoc) of counting
occurrences in odoc was developed. The aim is to add usage statistics in the generated index, so that search
engines can use it to sort search results. It will also allow for a "jump-to-documentation" feature in the
[rendered source code](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/909) that was merged in March.

**** *Odoc* Support for Tables in ~odoc~

Contributors: @gpetiot (Tarides), @panglesd (Tarides), @Julow (Tarides), @jonludlam (Tarides), @trefis (Tarides)

The PRs adding support for a new syntax to create tables in Odoc have been merged!

As a reminder, this new feature will enable the creation of tables using a syntax similar to Markdown:
#+begin_example
{t
  a  | b | c | d
  ---|:--|--:|:-:
  a  | b | c | d
}
#+end_example

Odoc will generate tables for different backends, including LaTex and HTML. This new syntax will be available in
the upcoming release of Odoc 2.3.0. Stay tuned!

*Activities:*
- Merged the PR that adds a new syntax for tables in odoc-parser -- [ocaml-doc/odoc-parser#11](https://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc-parser/pull/11)
- Merged the PR that adds support for tables to odoc -- [ocaml/odoc#893](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/893)

*** Editing and Refactoring Code

**** *Merlin* Support for Project-Wide References in Merlin

Contributors: @voodoos (Tarides), @let-def (Tarides)

Not much progress was made on the support for project-wide occurrences in Merlin this month due to the Merlin
team's focus on performance improvements, fixing user-reported bugs, compatibility with OCaml 5.1, and the release
of Merlin 4.9

The remaining issues, such as module aliases traversal and index filtering, were discussed, with the implementation
of identified solutions set to commence soon.

**** *Merlin* Improving Merlin's Performance

Contributed by: @pitag-ha (Tarides), @3Rafal (Tarides), @voodoos (Tarides), @let-def (Tarides)

The final stages of work on benchmarking Merlin are in progress, with the Merlin team focusing on integrating the
developed benchmarking tooling into Merlin's CI using ~current-bench~. The
[PR](https://github.com/pitag-ha/merl-an/pull/2) on ~merl-an~ has been opened to add a new current-bench compatible
backend and work has started on adding memory usage information to Merlin's telemetry.

On the performance optimisations front, the PPX phase cache in Merlin was completed and merged. Issues were opened
upstream on how tools that use Merlin can benefit from the new PPX cache.

*Activities:*
- Implemented a sketch of ~current-bench~ backend in ~merl-an~ -- [pitag-ha/merl-an#2](https://github.com/pitag-ha/merl-an/pull/2).
- Started work on adding memory usage information to Merlin's telemetry.
- Completed and merged the PPX phase cache PR -- [ocaml/merlin#1584](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1584). - Opened issues at ~dune~ and ~ocaml-lsp-server~ to keep record of the necessities to enable the PPX phase cache
  - In Dune: ~dune ocaml-merlin~: enable PPX phase cache -- [ocaml/dune#7731](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7731).
  - In OCaml LSP: Handle Merlin's PPX phase cache -- [ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1095](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1095).
- Identified and fixed a memory "leak" related to the ~(F A).t~ syntax, causing uncontrolled memoization table growth -- [ocaml/merlin#1609](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1609).

**** *OCaml LSP* Using Dune RPC on Windows

Contributors: @nojb (LexiFi)

In May, a couple of patches that build on the [support for watch mode on
Windows](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7010) introduced in Dune 3.7.0 were merged in
[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/7666) and [OCaml LSP](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1079) to
allow OCaml LSP to use Dune RPC. The aim is to enable Windows users to leverage Dune RPC and receive build statuses
and more exhaustive build errors in the editor when Dune is running in watch mode.

Dune 3.8.0 was released with the above patches and a release of OCaml LSP will follow in the coming weeks.

**** *OCaml LSP* Upstreaming OCaml LSP's Fork of Merlin

Contributors: @voodoos (Tarides), @3Rafal (Tarides)

The effort to upstream OCaml LSP's fork of merlin continued. Necessary patches in Merlin have been reviewed and
merged. Work also continued on the PR to use Merlin as a library in OCaml LSP.

*Activities:*
- Reviewed and merged the PR enabling configurable Merlin PP/PPX spawning -- [ocaml/merlin#1585](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1585).
- Continued working on the PR to use Merlin as a library in LSP -- [ocaml/ocaml-lsp#1070](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/1070).

*** Formatting Code

**** *OCamlFormat* Closing the Gap Between OCamlFormat and ~ocp-indent~

Contributors: @gpetiot (Tarides) and @EmileTrotignon (Tarides), @Julow (Tarides), @ceastlund (Jane Street)

The effort continued to tune the ~janestreet~ profile so that it aligns better with the output of ~ocp-indent~.
Despite encountering difficulties with formatting "cinaps" comments, considerable progress was made in May and work
will continue throughout June.

*Activities:*
- Align pattern alias -- [ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#2359](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat/pull/2359)
