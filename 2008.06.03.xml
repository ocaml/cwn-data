			<cwn_title>Release date for 3.11?</cwn_title>

			<cwn_who>Richard Jones asked and Xavier Leroy answered</cwn_who>
			<cwn_what>
&gt; I'm sure the answer will be 'when it's ready', but is there a release 
&gt; date (month / year / ...) for 3.11 or release candidates of 3.11? 

I'd like to release by late August, provided no show-stopping problems 
show up by then.

			<cwn_title>First release of Oug: reference graph from ocaml code</cwn_title>

I'm glad to announce the first release of Oug (0.1).

Oug is a code analysis tool building reference graphs from OCaml code, that
is graphs representing which elements (value, module, class, ...) reference
which elements.

It comes with the Ouglib library to be able to embed the analyzer in other
OCaml applications.

From the graph, various outputs can be obtained: list of elements not
referenced anywhere ("dead code"), various graphiz graphs, ...

Oug does not compute the call graph of the given OCaml code; this would
require data flow analysis. For this reason, the "dead code" dump always
consider that every method is referenced.
