* Jupyter -- a better UTop?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/jupyter-a-better-utop/2633/1

** nil announced


I recently figured out how to get an alternative REPL which has some things that UTop doesn't. It's the Jupyter console, which runs in a terminal (and is less well-known than the Jupyter notebook).

Here's how to set it up:
- install jupyter by a method that works for your OS.
- ~opam install jupyter~
- set up ocaml as a kernel for jupyter, as explained in the package doc: ~jupyter kernelspec install --name ocaml-jupyter "$(opam config var share)/jupyter"~
- in ~jupyter kernelspec list~ find the new kernel directory and edit the JSON file there, for instance to include a custom ~.ocamlinit~. In mine I added ~#use topfind;;~
- enable vi edit mode by ~echo "c.ZMQTerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode='vi'" >> ~/.jupyter/jupyter_console_config.py~ (entirely non optional ;) )

Then start your new REPL by ~jupyter console --kernel=ocaml-jupyter~. Thanks to
the cool ocaml jupyter [[https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter][package]] it will
use Merlin to autocomplete and it will have a ~vi~ mode!
You can also use various editor plugins to send code cells to the kernel
directly from an editing buffer. Right now, it's missing the
~UTop.set_create_implicits~ but that not a huge problem. Overall, pretty neat in
my book!

Interesting!

As a (k)ubuntu linux user at least, I had to add ~--user~ to step #3 to avoid running as ~sudo~. I also had to manually create the ~~/.jupyter~ directory before running the ~echo~ command.

** 文宇祥 announced


I'm happy to announce the first release of *[[https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird][ocamlearlybird]]*.

~ocamlearlybird~  is a debug adapter purely written in OCaml. Currently it has these features:

- Auto discover sources heuristically
- Line breakpoints and column breakpoints
- Basic  ~next~ ,  ~step in~ ,  ~step out~  and  ~continue~  commands
- Inspect stack frames, local variables, closure variables and global variables

You can use ~ocamlearlybird~ in VS Code by install [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hackwaly.ocaml-debugger][ocaml-debugger extension]].

Enjoy!
      

** Christian Lindig asked and 文宇祥 replied


> Could you talk a bit about how it works?

It use env CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET and [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/runtime/caml/debugger.h][debugger.h]] to talk to the debugger in vm.

> Does it work with native code?

It only work with bytecode with debug information - compiled with -g option.

> How does it hook into the execution of a program?

Mostly same as the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/debugger][ocamldebug's implementation]]
