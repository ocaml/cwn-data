2) lablgtk newbie question
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Jones asked and Jacques Garrigue answered:

> Why do I have to run lablgtk programs using the 'lablgtk' interpreter?
> What does this do above and beyond ordinary /usr/bin/ocaml?

Two years ago, when ocaml didn't have dynamic loading, this was a
requirement, like for old versions of Tcl as you say.

Nowadays, except on some exotic platform, this is just a question of
comfort: the toplevel is configured to make its use easier.
You can do the same thing by passing some options to the standard
toplevel:
        ocaml -w s -I +lablgtk lablgtk.cma gtkInit.cmo

3) Bigarray
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the profile shows that significant time is spent in the bigarray_get_*
and igarray_set_* functions, this indicates that your Caml code is too
polymorphic.  ocamlopt can inline bigarray accesses only when the
types of the bigarrays is fully, statically known.

It is easy to get unwanted polymorphism for Caml code that uses
bigarrays.  For instance,

        let f a = a.{0} <- 3.14

has type (float, 'a, 'b) Bigarray.Array1.t -> unit.  The assignment 
determines that the Caml type of the array elements is float,
but it doesn't determine fully the underlying representation type
(could be float32 as well as float64), nor the layout of the array
(could be C or Fortran layout).

Thus, the assignment cannot be inlined and must be performed by a C 
function that discriminates at run-time on the actual representation
types and layout.  This is quite slow indeed.  To avoid this, consider
adding a type constraint:

        open Bigarray

        type floatarray = (float, float64_elt, c_layout) Array1.t

        let f (a: floatarray) = a.{0} <- 3.14

That should improve performance somewhat.  Still, the extra
flexibility of bigarrays over regular arrays causes the inlined
bigarray access code to be a bit slower than regular array accesses.

4) Str memory leak in 3.06?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

No, there is no need for explicit deallocation of regexps.  Actually,
there is no leak either: if you put a call to Gc.major() in the loop,
memory usage remains constant.

What happens is that the speed of the (incremental) major collector
isn't appropriately adjusted, so it runs too slowly and lets "floating
garbage" accumulate.  This is a common problem with Caml objects that
are just handle on resources allocated outside the Caml heap: precise
determination of the space consumption of the latter is generally
impossible, causing the incremental major GC to run often too slowly,
sometimes too fast...

The new implementation of Str that will go in release 3.07 allocates
all its data in the Caml heap, so this fixes both the issue you  
mention and the "floating garbage" problem described above.

5) new ensemble release - 1.41
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ohad Rodeh announced:

   I've put out a new Ensemble release, version 1.41. This version was
tested only on i386 platforms with Linux/win32 operating systems, so
people working on HP/Solaris please check it out and send me fixes.

RELEASE_NOTES

  This release primarily cleans up the maestro code-base. There is now
just one code for all platforms with relatively few "ifdefs". From the   
next release the CORBA/GIOP code included in Maestro will not be
supported. Aside from a maestro cleanup several bugs have been fixed:
1. A maestro bug due to a miscalculation of the previous group leader
2. A total-ordering bug in the Seqbb protocol
3. A bug that prevented the use of a user-specified IP address for an
   Ensemble process


OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.06 for this version.

PORTABILITY
  This version was tested on Linux (RedHat 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, i386
  architecture) and windows XP.

======================================================================
6) LSM2003/VHLL Annoucement
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fabrice Popineau announced:

The 2003 Libre Software Meeting (LSM) will take place  this year in Metz
(North-East  of France) from July,  9th to July, 12th.  I have taken the
responsibility for the VHLL track (Very High Level Languages) originally
initiated by Robert  Strandh  and headed  by   him for the  first  three
editions. I will be pleased to welcome in Metz all people interested in
VHLL and who will contribute to the success of the 2003 LSM.

This track is meant to show how those high level languages such as Lisp, 
Scheme and their   derivatives, ML, Python,  etc. increase productivity,
quality, fiability,  ease of maintenance  in the  context of developing
applications.

Developers who want  to  share  their  experience in this   domain  are
invited to contact me. Subjects may include :
- development of tools or platforms
- comparison between languages
- developer's experiences using VHLL
- ...

You will find more information about the LSM2003 by browsing
http://rencontresmondiales.org. The web site is frequently updated.

Old cwn
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to miss a cwn, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@inria.fr) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
