** polytypic announced


I'm happy to announce that Picos version 0.6.0 has been released!

#+begin_quote
Picos is a systems programming interface between effects based schedulers and concurrent abstractions.
#+end_quote

A lot of work has been done on Picos since previous announcements.

You might start on the new minimalist landing page for [[https://ocaml-multicore.github.io/picos/][Picos]], which, among other things, allows you to access the documentation of all the released Picos versions.

Also, in case you missed it, a recording of the talk

#+begin_quote
[[https://icfp24.sigplan.org/details/ocaml-2024-papers/5/Picos-Interoperable-effects-based-concurrency][Picos — Interoperable effects based concurrency]]
#+end_quote

can be found [[https://youtu.be/OuQqblCxJ2Y?t=20115][here]].

We also held a workshop on concurrency and parallelism at [[https://fun-ocaml.com/][Fun OCaml]]. You might enjoy trying out [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/fun-ocaml-workshop][the exercise we developed for the workshop]].

As, for reasons of dependencies, Picos now comes in no less than [[https://ocaml-multicore.github.io/picos/0.6.0/][8 packages]] and multiple libraries, here is a summary of the packages and the libraries inside each package:

** Gerd Stolpmann announced


findlib-1.9.7 is out. This is mostly a bugfix release. There is now also
some support for relocability (driven by environment variables),
contributed by Marek Kubica.

For manual, download, manuals, etc. see here:

http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html

An updated OPAM package will follow soon.
      



* First release candidate for OCaml 5.2.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/first-release-candidate-for-ocaml-5-2-1/15578/1

** octachron announced


The release of OCaml version 5.2.1 is imminent.

OCaml 5.2.1 is a collection of safe but import runtime time bug fixes backported from the 5.3 branch of OCaml. The full list of bug fixes is available below.

In order to ensure that the future release works as expected, we are planning to test a release candidate during the upcoming week.

If you find any bugs, please report them here on [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][GitHub]].

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands on opam 2.1:
#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create 5.2.1~rc1
#+end_example

The source code for the release candidate is available on

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.2.1-rc1.tar.gz][GitHub]]
- [[https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.2/ocaml-5.2.1~rc1.tar.gz][Inria archives]]

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:
#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.2.1~rc1+options <option_list>
#+end_example
where `<option_list>` is a space-separated list of `ocaml-option-*` packages. For instance, for a `flambda` and `no-flat-float-array` switch:
#+begin_example
opam switch create 5.2.1~rc1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.2.1~rc1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_example

All available options can be listed with `opam search ocaml-option`.

*Changes Since OCaml 5.2.0*
*** Runtime System:
  - [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13207][#13207]]: Be sure to reload the register caching the exception handler in
    caml_c_call and caml_c_call_stack_args, as its value may have been changed
    if the OCaml stack is expanded during a callback.
    (Miod Vallat, report by Vesa Karvonen, review by Gabriel Scherer and
     Xavier Leroy)
  - [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/13252][#13252]]: Rework register assignment in the interpreter code on m68k on Linux,

    (Miod Vallat, report by Stéphane Glondu, review by Gabriel Scherer and
     Xavier Leroy)

    platform.
    (Stéphane Glondu, review by Miod Vallat and Vincent Laviron)

    on rooted values inside blocking questions / without the runtime lock.
    (Calling Int_val(...) on non-rooted immediates is fine, but any
     access to rooted values must be done outside blocking sections /
     with the runtime lock.)

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4

** Reynir Björnsson announced


I am pleased to announce the first release of [[https://github.com/robur-coop/mirage-swapfs][mirage-swapfs]] (swapfs on opam). It is an experimental library to use a mirage block device for ephemeral, append-only, anonymous "files". It was developed for use cases such as in [[https://git.robur.coop/robur/opam-mirror/][opam-mirror]]  where opam package source archives are downloaded. The files are first downloaded to "swap" and if the download succeeds and the checksum is as expected the data is then copied over to the tar filesystem.

Internally it uses a weak pointer array (~Weak.t~) to map "block" offsets to handles. The idea is the garbage collector can help us free up "blocks" if the user forgets to explicitly free the handle. A "block" is (configurable, see ~blocking_factor~) multiple of sectors in order to reduce bookkeeping overhead. With a sector size of 512 bytes the default is 1 MiB per block.

See also the documentation https://robur-coop.github.io/mirage-swapfs/doc/swapfs/index.html

I would be interested to hear about other ideas or approaches.
