Rudi Grinberg announced
───────────────────────

  Dear Vim & Neovim users,

  I would like to announce that I've officially moved the [vim-ocaml]
  repository under the control of the OCaml organization on
  github. Please direct your bug reports and pull requests to this
  repository. This move is done not because vim-ocaml is being
  neglected, on the contrary, there's an active team of maintainers that
  recently expanded. I simply want to take this opportunity to draw more
  Vim & Noevim users to this project, as I suspect many users aren't
  aware of recent efforts.
