      <cwn_title>Initial Release of OCI, a framework for continuous integrations and benchmarks</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-04/msg00044.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Fran√ßois Bobot announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm pleased to release OCI. OCI is a framework for continuous integrations and
benchmarks. At its heart it is a container manager and at the top a tool that
allows to compile, test, and compare compilations and runs of inter-dependent
git repositories.

The main interest of OCI is to be able to select a specific commit of a project,
and of its dependencies, easily.

Here let's imagine myproj is your cool project ;) :
* ./myproj-client run --rootfs 1 myproj
* ./myproj-client run --rootfs 1 --myproj=cool_feature myproj
* ./myproj-client run --rootfs 1 --ocaml=4.03 myproj
* ./myproj-client run --rootfs 1 --ocaml=trunk --myproj=new_warning_trunk myproj

This ability allows it to compare the performance of different commits of a
project but also to compare between different versions of libraries or the
compiler (ex: flambda)

OCI is used continuously for testing pull-requests within the Frama-C
development team, and it also allows to track continuously their compatibility
with the current tip of ocaml 4.03 branch (automatically compiled when it
changes).

The tutorial at https://github.com/bobot/oci/blob/master/README.adoc will show
you a full example of the abilities of OCI. The possibility to use OCI as a
framework is not shown yet.

You can install it with:

  opam install oci


The repository is at:

  https://github.com/bobot/oci


It has been presented at the last Ocaml User in Paris (OUPS) and it is supported
by the ANR SOPRANO Project.
