* Sandmark Nightly - Benchmarking as a Service
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-sandmark-nightly-benchmarking-as-a-service/10174/1

** Shakthi Kannan announced


Tarides is happy to announce Sandmark Nightly benchmarking as a service. tl;dr OCaml compiler developers can now
point development branches at the service and get sequential and parallel benchmark results at
https://sandmark.tarides.com.

[[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark][Sandmark]] is a collection of sequential and parallel OCaml benchmarks, its
dependencies, and the scripts to run the benchmarks and collect the results. Sandmark was developed for the Multicore
OCaml project in order to (a) ensure that OCaml 5 (with multicore support) does not introduce regressions for
sequential programs compared to sequential OCaml 4 and (b) OCaml 5 programs scale well with multiple cores. In order
to reduce the noise and get actionable results, Sandmark is typically run on [[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/ocaml_bench_scripts#notes-on-hardware-and-os-settings-for-linux-benchmarking][tuned
machines]].
This makes it harder for OCaml developers to use Sandmark for development who may not have tuned machines with a
large number of cores.

To address this, we introduce Sandmark Nightly service which runs the sequential and parallel benchmarks for a set of
compiler /variants/ (branch/commit/PR + compiler & runtime options) on two tuned machines:

- Turing (28 cores, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5120 CPU @ 2.20GHz, 64 GB RAM)
- Navajo (128 cores, AMD EPYC 7551 32-Core Processor, 504 GB RAM)

OCaml developers can request their development branches to be added to the nightly runs by adding it to
[[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark-nightly-config][sandmark-nightly-config]]. The results will appear the
following day at https://sandmark.tarides.com.

Here is an illustration of sequential benchmark results from the service:

https://i.imgur.com/Mn7VZky.png

You should first specify the ~number of variants~ that you want for comparison, and then select either the ~navajo~
or ~turing~ hostnames. The dates for which benchmark results are available are then listed in the ~date~ column. If
there are more than one result on a given day, then the specific variant name, SHA1 commit and date are displayed
together for selection. You need to choose one of the variants as a baseline for comparison. In the following graph,
the ~5.1.0+trunk+sequential_20220712_920fb8e~ build on the ~navajo~ server has been chosen as the baseline, and you
can see the normalized time (seconds) comparison for the various Sandmark benchmarks for both
~5.1.0+trunk+sequential_20220713_c759890~ and ~5.1.0+trunk+sequential_20220714_606abe8~ variants. We observe that the
~matrix_multiplication~ and ~soli~ benchmark have become 5% slower as compared to the July 12, 2022 nightly run.

https://i.imgur.com/7b0yS0h.png

Similarly, the normalized MaxRSS (KB) graph for the same baseline and variants chosen for comparison is illustrated
below:

https://i.imgur.com/SfMbEiu.png

The ~mandelbrot6~ and ~fannkuchredux~ benchmarks have increased the MaxRSS (KB) by 3% as compared to the baseline
variant, whereas, the metric has significantly improved for the ~lexifi-g2pp~ and ~sequence_cps~ benchmarks.

The parallel benchmark speedup results are also available from the Sandmark nightly runs.

https://i.imgur.com/uKFDXCv.png

https://i.imgur.com/24BGXVZ.png

We observe from the speedup graph that there is not much difference between ~5.1.0+trunk+parallel_20220714_606abe8~
and the ~5.1.0+trunk+decouple_20220706_eb7a38d~ developer branch results. The x-axis in the graph represents the
number of domains, while the y-axis corresponds to the speedup. The number in the parenthesis against each benchmark
refers to the corresponding running time of the sequential benchmark. These comparison results are useful to observe
any performance regressions over time. It is recommended to use the ~turing~ machine results for the parallel
benchmarks as it is tuned.

If you would like to use Sandmark nightly for OCaml compiler development, please do ping us for access to the
[[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark-nightly-config][sandmark-nightly-config]] repository so that you may add your
own compiler variants.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/pjmp][Pomba Magar]] we now have a code editor with highlighting. It hopefully should
also solve the lack of monospace font on safari.

** Matt Russell announced


Jane Street is looking to hire Front End Engineers that want to design and build our next-generation of browser-based
tools for operating our trading infrastructure (in OCaml).  We’re building tools for expert users, and want to
maintain a high UX bar while building tools that are powerful and flexible, so it’s a challenging domain.

Ron Minsky wrote a bit more about the role here:

* BAP 2.5.0 Release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-bap-2-5-0-release/10185/1

** Ivan Gotovchits announced


We are proud to announce the 2.5.0 release of the Carnegie Mellon University Binary Analysis Platform (CMU BAP). This
is one of the biggest releases of BAP with lots of new [[https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap/releases/tag/v2.5.0][features and bug fixes]]. In this release, we significantly
improved BAP performance (in some use cases by a factor of three) and reduced memory consumption (up to a factor of
two). In addition, we devised a new method for representing floating-point operations that is scalable and efficient
and now we enable floating-point lifters for all x86 binaries with little to no extra overhead. The floating-point
support for other targets is coming! We also rewrote the ABI specifications and now support dozens of different ABI.
The new ABIs support calling conventions for structures and floating-point values and the `bap-c` library was
significantly expanded with lots of new functions and types to describe C types and C object layouts.

You can install bap with

#+begin_example
opam install bap.2.5.0
#+end_example

Do not forget to  ~opam update~ before that.

* Liquidsoap 2.1.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-liquidsoap-2-1-0/10192/1

** Romain Beauxis announced


Liquidsoap ~2.1.0~ was just released, some ~10 months after the initial release of the ~2.0.x~ release cycle!

The release is available here: https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases/tag/v2.1.0 and should be coming through
~opam~ pretty soon.

*** 🤔  What is liquidsoap?

Liquidsoap is a statically-typed, type-inferred, functional scripting language equipped with specialized operators to
build audio and video stream automation.

The liquidsoap language offers all the flexibility and expressivity of a fully featured programming language to help
build your media streams.

Using liquidsoap, one can very quickly stand up a media streaming platform that can rotate files from playlists,
accept live DJ input, mux audio and video, encode (or not!) and send the resulting data to youtube, icecast, HLS and
more..

*** :white_check_mark: Why liquidsoap?

While there are many tools that offer competing features, the real difference with liquidsoap is its scripting
language.

Setting up tools using configuration files is often easier and more straight forward, however, when it comes to the
finer details, such as inserting jingles between shows, defining crossfades between tracks and more, potentially,
each project has its own set of expectations, and this is where liquidsoap becomes really useful!

*** :zap:️ What's new in Liquidsoap 2.1.0? :zap:

Lots of things have been brewing since the ~2.0.0~ release. This new release branch is intended to bring up some of
the breaking changes that were introduced while we keep working on more exciting future changes that we have on our
[[https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/blob/main/ROADMAP.md][roadmap]]

Some noticeable changes include:

**** Improved JSON parsing

You should now be able to do:
#+begin_src ruby
let json.parse ({
  foo,
  bla,
  gni
} : {
  foo: string,
  bla: float,
  gni: bool
}) = '{ "foo": "aabbcc", "bla": 3.14, "gni": true }'
#+end_src
For any one who has ever tried to parse json in their liquidsoap scripts, this is gonna be a game changer. We have a
detailed article [[https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/json.html][here]]

**** Regular expressions are now first-class entities.

This should be familiar to anyone used to working with Javascript's regular expression. So, now, instead of doing:

#+begin_src ruby
string.match(pattern="\\d+", s)
#+end_src

You will now do:

#+begin_src ruby
r/\d+/.test(s)
#+end_src

There's a detailed description of this new feature
[[https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/language.html#regular_expressions][here]].
      



* Vim now highlights types, feedback welcome
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/vim-now-highlights-types-feedback-welcome/10198/1

** Maëlan announced


[[https://github.com/ocaml/vim-ocaml/pull/76][A patch]] just made its way to [[https://github.com/ocaml/vim-ocaml][the community-maintained Vim files for OCaml]] (not propagated to the
[[https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/runtime][official Vim distribution]], yet), that tries to highlight types. IMHO the patch is large and hacky so you may
want to try it cautiously, and *feedback would be appreciated*. :-)

The former behavior was to highlight identifiers that happened to be the name of a builtin type (such as ~int~ or
~list~), regardless of where they appeared. Now, in principle, all type expressions can be highlighted, and be so
only when in a type context. By default, only builtin types are highlighted, but you can unleash the full power of
the new linter:

#+begin_src vim
" put this in ~/.vim/after/syntax/ocaml.vim for instance:
hi link ocamlTypeConstr   Type
hi link ocamlTypeBuiltin  Type
hi link ocamlTypeVar      Type
hi link ocamlTypeAnyVar   Type
#+end_src

or fancier (if you like excess :rainbow:):

#+begin_src vim
" 112 = light green (the color of the “Type“ hl group with my theme)
hi ocamlTypeConstr       ctermfg=112
hi ocamlTypeBuiltin      ctermfg=112 cterm=bold
hi ocamlTypeVar          ctermfg=112 cterm=italic
hi ocamlTypeAnyVar       ctermfg=112 cterm=bold
#+end_src

Even if you don’t care about highlighting types, allowing the linter to discriminate between types and exceptions has
some tangential benefits.
