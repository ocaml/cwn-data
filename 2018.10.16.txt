Bruno Bernardo announced
────────────────────────

  The next OUPS meetup will take place on Tuesday, October 23, 7pm at
  IRILL on the Jussieu campus. As usual, we will have a few talks,
  followed by pizzas and drinks.

  The talks will be the following:

  • Jacques Garrigue, Lightweight linearly-typed programming with lenses
      and monads
  • Yann Régis-Gianas, Learn OCaml
  • Gabriel Scherer, Porting the OCaml parser of the compiler from  
    ocamlyacc to Menhir

  Please do note that we are always in demand of talk *proposals* for
  future meetups.

  To register, or for more information, go here:

  *Registration is required! Access is not guaranteed after 7pm if
  you're not registered.* (It also helps us to order the right amount of
  food.)

Dune 1.4.0
══════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-1-4-0/2712/1]


Rudi Grinberg announced
───────────────────────

  The dune team is pleased to announce the 1.4.0 release of Dune. The
  highlight of this release is the improved support for menhir, in
  particular the long awaited `--infer' flag. This seemingly small
  feature took quite a bit of coordination between the maintainers of
  dune and menhir. So I'd like to thank @fpottier for helping us out
  with this by adding better support for dune in menhir itself, and
  implementing the majority of the support in dune as well.

  The rest of the release is mostly bug fixes, but one notable feature
  is that dune is now `C-c' friendly. Dune will now resume exactly where
  it's stopped after interruption instead of restarting the entire
  build.

  Here is the full change log:


1.4.0 (10/10/2018)
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Do not fail if the output of `ocamlc -config' doesn't include
    `standard_runtime' (#1326, @diml)

  • Let `Configurator.V1.C_define.import' handle negative integers
    (#1334, @Chris00)

  • Re-execute actions when a target is modified by the user inside
    `_build' (#1343, fix #1342, @diml)

  • Pass `--set-switch' to opam (#1341, fix #1337, @diml)

  • Fix bad interaction between multi-directory libraries the `menhir'
    stanza (#1373, fix #1372, @diml)

  • Integration with automatic formatters (#1252, fix #1201, @emillon)

  • Better error message when using `(self_build_stubs_archive ...)' and
    `(c_names ...)' or `(cxx_names ...)' simultaneously. (#1375, fix
    #1306, @nojb)

  • Improve name detection for packages when the prefix isn't an actual
    package (#1361, fix #1360, @rgrinberg)

  • Support for new menhir rules (#863, fix #305, @fpottier, @rgrinberg)

  • Do not remove flags when compiling compatibility modules for wrapped
    mode (#1382, fix #1364, @rgrinberg)

  • Fix reason support when using `staged_pps' (#1384, @charlesetc)

  • Add support for `enabled_if' in `rule', `menhir', `ocamllex',
    `ocamlyacc' (#1387, @diml)

  • Exit gracefully when a signal is received (#1366, @diml)

  • Load all defined libraries recursively into utop (#1384, fix #1344,
    @rgrinberg)

  • Allow to use libraries `bytes', `result' and `uchar' without
    `findlib' installed (#1391, @nojb)

  • Take argument to self_build_stubs_archive into account. (#1395,
    @nojb)

  • Fix bad interaction between `env' customization and vendored
    projects: when a vendored project didn't have its own `env' stanza,
    the `env' stanza from the enclosing project was in effect (#1408,
    @diml)

  • Fix stop early bug when scanning for watermarks (#1423, @struktured)


State of OCaml and web assembly

Carmelo Piccione asked
──────────────────────

  I spent some time studying various ways the OCaml compiler can produce
  web assembly and interpret or depend on other web assembly
  libraries. The landscape is quite confusing. Does anyone have
  experience with OCaml and web assembly? Is there a reliable project to
  bet on and start developing with? What about interop with other
  libraries that compile to wasm and you want to reference in OCaml?
  Here's a list of the projects I have discovered which seem
  relevant. Would appreciate insights on whether they are being
  maintained, or if anybody has noteworthy experience with them:

  • ocamlrun-wasm: [https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ocamlrun-wasm]

    > This is a build script for building the OCaml bytecode interpreter
      for WebAssembly using emscripten.

  • wasm: [https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/wasm/wasm.1.0/]

    > An OCaml library to read and write Web Assembly (wasm) files and
      manipulate their AST.

  • cmm_of_wasm: [http://simonjf.com/2018/08/27/cmm-of-wasm.html]

    > From WebAssembly to Native Code via the OCaml Backend.

  • [https://github.com/SanderSpies/ocaml/tree/wasm/wasmcomp]

    > A fork of the ocaml compiler with a web assembly compile target.

  • grain: [https://github.com/grain-lang/grain]

    > Grain is a language built for the modern web by leveraging the
      brilliant work done by the WebAssembly project.

    While grain is not actually OCaml it seems to be a fork of the OCaml
    codebase and thus worthy of mention.
