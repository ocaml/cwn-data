** jbeckford announced


There is now a new library ~MlFront_Top~ with a build tool ~mlfront-top~ that will generate self-contained OCaml toplevel script files with parallelism based on @c-cube's moonpool library:

#+begin_example
  .
  ├── AcmeWidgets_Std/
  │   ├── JobsA1.ml
  │   └── JobsA2.ml
  └── BobBuilder_Std/
      └── JobsB.ml
#+end_example

#+begin_example
$ mlfront-top -o buildscript.ml

$ ocaml buildscript.ml -j 2 -native
  legend: -> start | <- finish
     directory create: target/
     file create: target/AcmeWidgets_Std.ml
     link create: AcmeWidgets_Std/JobsA1.ml -> target/AcmeWidgets_Std__JobsA1.ml
     link create: AcmeWidgets_Std/JobsA2.ml -> target/AcmeWidgets_Std__JobsA2.ml
     link create: BobBuilder_Std/JobsB.ml -> target/BobBuilder_Std__JobsB.ml
  -> compile: AcmeWidgets_Std.JobsA1
  -> compile: AcmeWidgets_Std.JobsA2
  <- compile: AcmeWidgets_Std.JobsA1
  <- compile: AcmeWidgets_Std.JobsA2
  -> compile: AcmeWidgets_Std
  <- compile: AcmeWidgets_Std
  -> compile: BobBuilder_Std.JobsB
  <- compile: BobBuilder_Std.JobsB
  -> executable create: BobBuilder_Std.JobsB
  <- executable create: BobBuilder_Std.JobsB
  done.

$ target/BobBuilder_Std.JobsB
I am an A1!
I am an A2!
I am a B!
#+end_example

It requires the ~ocaml~ binary and ~ocamlc~ or ~ocamlopt~. The complete example is at https://gitlab.com/dkml/build-tools/MlFront/-/blob/0.4.0-6/tests/MlFront_Top/jobs.t/run.t.
      



* Rpmfile library v0.3.0 with new Eio-based reader
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/rpmfile-library-v0-3-0-with-new-eio-based-reader/15149/1

** Mikhail announced


Today I want to tell you about new version of [[https://github.com/dx3mod/rpmfile][Rpmfile library]]. Rpmfile is a library for reading metadata from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager][RPM]] packages. Originally Rpmfile's parser (reader) used [[https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom][Angstrom]] for parsing. And in the new release added new modern [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio][Eio]]-based reader. 

Globally, the project is now split into four packages: ~rpmfile~, which contains signatures and implementation-independent functions, ~rpmfile-unix~ with the original Angstrom parser, and ~rpmfile-eio~ (with ~rpmfile-cli~) written using Eio.

*** My experience porting to Eio 

Eio is a fantastic effect-based I/O library for a more modern age in multicore OCaml. I think it takes the best ideas from the ecosystem. So built-in ~Buf_read~ and ~Buf_write~ modules implement ideas from Angstrom and Faraday libraries. Almost API one-to-one, allowing porting via copy-paste. 

But, of course, not everything is so perfect. Unlike the ~Angstrom.parse_~ function, the ~Buf_read.parse~ function thinks I want to read a whole stream to end of input.

A snippet of the source code:
#+begin_src ocaml
let parse ?initial_size ~max_size p flow =
  let buf = of_flow flow ?initial_size ~max_size in
  format_errors (p <* end_of_input) buf
  (*               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^           
                    0_0 nice (not)        *)
#+end_src

So I had to rewrite this function myself in a form similar to ~Angstrom.Consume.Prefix~.

**** Is it a signed or unsigned integer? 

~BE.uint16~ and other similar functions are *signed int* even though they have the prefix ~u~ in the name for some reason.

**** And a few other differences

- ~Angstrom.advance~ is ~skip~
- ~Angstrom.pos~ is ~consumed_bytes~

*** P.S.

Thanks for your attention!

** Jim Dupont announced


Here is a working first version (with warts) of a ppxlib to yojson converter,
am still testing it but the hello world is working, I have tried multiple times to get this to work, 
and finally settled on the import route to override the type system.
code here:
https://github.com/meta-introspector/ocaml-libppx-import-yojson-introspector

example snippet

#+begin_example
{
  "pexp_desc": [
    "Pexp_constant",
    [
      "Pconst_string",
      "Hello, World!"
    ]
  ]
}
#+end_example
      



* Dune Developer Preview Updates

** ostera announced


Just wanted to share some of the work the Dune has been up to lately re: the Developer Preview we announced [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-platform-newsletter-march-may-2024/14765][here]] :) – we'll be using this thread to share more updates as things go.

As always, we hold our Dune Developer meetings in public and you're more than welcome to subscribe to our public Calendar ([[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_5cd698df6784e385b1cdcdc1dbca18c061faa96959a04781566d304dc9ec7319%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FStockholm][Google]], [[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_5cd698df6784e385b1cdcdc1dbca18c061faa96959a04781566d304dc9ec7319%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics][iCal]])

*** Getting ready for the Public Beta

As we prepare for the public beta, we're ramping up the DX interviews and ensuring the first few users will have a fun, productive experience with the developer preview.

#+begin_quote
:inbox_tray: If you signed up for the Dev Preview back in May, check your inbox for a link and instructions to schedule your DX interview with us.
#+end_quote

Here's a sample video ([[https://mas.to/deck/@leostera/112988841207690720][Mastodon]] or [[https://x.com/leostera/status/1825519465527673238][X]]) where you can see me building the Riot project on a machine that does not have OCaml installed. It is pretty neat!

Seriously, big shoutout to the Dune team at Tarides[0] who have been doing a phenomenal job :clap: :sparkles: :camel: 

So here's what getting started with OCaml looks like today with the Dune Developer Preview as of today (August 19 2024):

1. get ~dune~ from our binary distribution – we'll soon make this public!
2. run ~dune pkg lock~ in your favorite project
3. run ~dune build~

That's it. No need to install anything else, Dune will see that lock file, fetch, and build all necessary dependencies.

#+begin_quote
:world_map: These are some strong step towards the [[https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap][OCaml Platform vision for 2026]], that we are actively working towards. If you have any thoughts or feedback please let me know!
#+end_quote

There are more improvements coming that will help remove friction to get started and creating a delightful experience. Both of these things we strongly believe will help onboard new users to the OCaml world.

Here's a few in the works:

- *Various DX improvements* – from new outputs to simplified workflows, we want to make using Dune just delightful.
- *Bundled support for dev tools* (ocalmformat, odoc, lsp) – the default toolset will be available without any extra steps! just call ~dune fmt~, and it works. No need to manually install anything else.
- *Automatic dependency locking* – when building, and even on watch mode, Dune will lock your dependencies by default and keep the lock up to date.
- *Cross-project Caching* – by default we'll enabled a local Dune cache that across the system, so you never rebuild the same dependency even across projects.
- *Signed binaries with certificates of origin* – we care deeply about security and want to make sure that any binary we ship will be easily verified and tracked back to its sources.

Stay tuned! :wave: 

PS: here's a longer video ([[https://mas.to/deck/@leostera/112988880290815356][Mastodon]], [[https://x.com/leostera/status/1825519469759812062][X]]) showing you the setup for OCaml from zero, creating a new project, and adding a dependency, all within ~5 minutes

** Nathan Rebours announced


This month's meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, [date=2024-08-20 time=17:00:00 timezone="Europe/London"]!

The meeting agenda thus far is to discuss the following:

- *5.2 Bump Progess*
    - Auto-generate AST pattern code and labelled arguments (e.g. ~value_binding ~constraint_:none~ but no positional argument?)
    - ~Ast_helper.Exp.function_~ deprecation
    - [[https://github.com/patricoferris/opam-ppxlib-repository][opam-repository overlay for 5.2 AST bump]]
- *Issues in migrations*
    - Bumping the AST has uncovered issues in migrating code up and down the internal ppxlib ASTs -- would be good to discuss this and also how to mitigate this going forward. 
- *Documentation*
    - Great user feedback from [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ppxlib-getting-the-original-definition-of-typ-constr-like-type-declaration-from-core-type-of-ptyp-constr/15110][Ppxlib: Getting the original definition of ~typ_constr~ like ~type_declaration~ from ~core_type~ of ~ptyp_constr~]] which we should take onboard and work into https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/issues/324 
- *Some carry over items from last month*
    - In general what is the medium term goals for ppxlib? Mostly maintenance and bumping the AST/keeping up with compiler releases?

The meeting will be hosted on google meet here: https://meet.google.com/yxw-ejnu-cju

Everyone is very welcome to join! :camel:
