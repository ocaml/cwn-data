Hongbo Zhang announced
──────────────────────

  We made a new release of bs-platform, feedback is very much
  appreciated!
  [https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/08/12/release-5-10-0]

  One feature that might interest you is that we support NODE_PATH in
  dependency resolving so that in theory you can use opam to install
  bucklescript packages, the directory layout is no longer tied to
  `node_modules'


x509 0.7 released
═════════════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-x509-0-7-released/4252/1]


Hannes Mehnert announced
────────────────────────

  it is my pleasure to announce the x509 0.7 series, which contains a
  major revision of the API (using a map instead of lists for
  extensions, general and distinguished names, …). The release 0.7.1 is
  already merged into the opam-repository, and users of x509 have been
  updated to comply with the new API. I wrote a blog post about this
  release – [https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/X50907]. I'm happy to receive
  feedback, either in this topic, via eMail, or via social media.


A(nother) short tutorial on how to use Dune to build and use Opam packages

Jocelyn Sérot announced
───────────────────────

  In the continuation of my last announcement, here’s another page
  containing a collection of simple projects showing how to use Dune for
  building and using Opam packages :

  [https://github.com/jserot/dune-howto]

  In the hope this can be useful to anyone starting to use these
  powerful tools.

  Again, comments, bug reports and suggestions for improvements welcome.


No debugger improvements in 4.08?
═════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/no-debugger-improvements-in-4-08/3158/7]


Continuing this thread, gasche announced
────────────────────────────────────────

  On the "good news" side, we were finally able to review and merge
  support for dynlinked code in ocamldebug (in trunk, not 4.08;
  [https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/8654]), which could be a big help
  for people using ocamldebug with plugins – some Coq hackers do this,
  for example.


The end of Camlp4
═════════════════

  Archive: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/the-end-of-camlp4/4216/89]


Deep in this thread, Anton Kochkov said
───────────────────────────────────────

  I think that everyone can just provide their suggestions about ppx
  here: [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/the-future-of-ppx/3766], which is a
  proper place for discussing the future of this subsystem.


Anton Kochkov then added
────────────────────────

  I also cleaned up the list in
  [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/the-end-of-camlp4/4216/2], removed
  obsolete projects and these that were fixed since already. Many of
  them also dropped the camlp4 dependency, but not made release
  yet. Added the issues links to those that are at GitHub, for tracking
  the progress.


release of batteries v2.10.0
════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  [https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-batteries-v2-10-0/4261/1]


UnixJunkie announced
────────────────────

  OCaml batteries included is a community maintained extension of the
  OCaml standard library.

  The batteries maintainers are pleased to announce the latest release:
  v2.10.0.  This minor release adds support for OCaml 4.08.0.

  Bug reports, pull requests and user feedback are warmly welcome, see
  the project page at
  [https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/]

  The library's API documentation can be found at:
  [http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.io/batteries-included/hdoc2/]

  After an `opam update' your should be able to do an `opam upgrade
  batteries' an enjoy this new release.

  This release is compatible with OCaml 4.08.0, but it is not complete
  with respect to the standard library of OCaml 4.08.0: this release saw
  a lot of changes to the standard library, which have not yet been made
  available in the corresponding Batteries module. This means that users
  of OCaml 4.08.0 (and Batteries 2.10.0) will have access to these
  functions, but users of older OCaml versions (and Batteries 2.10.0)
  will not. If you are looking for this kind of backward-compatibility
  of new functions, as provided by previous Batteries releases, we
  recommend trying the `stdcompat' library.

  Change log entries:
  • added LazyList.equal: `('a -> 'b -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'b t -> bool'
    #811 (Marshall Abrams, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  • added BatList.fold_while : `('acc -> 'a -> bool) -> ('acc -> 'a ->
    'acc) -> 'acc -> 'a list -> 'acc * 'a list' #889 (Francois Berenger,
    Thibault Suzanne)

  • fix `BatNum.of_float_string' on inputs between -1 and 0: "-0.5" or
    "-.5" would be interpreted as "0.5" or ".5".  #886, #887 (Gabriel
    Scherer, report by Marcel Hark)

  • added BatHashtbl.merge and merge_all #891 (Cedric Cellier, Francois
    Berenger, Gabriel Scherer)


Down 0.0.1

Getting Started in OCaml Notes

Philip Zucker asked
───────────────────

  Hi! I've been getting going in OCaml over the last couple weeks and
  wrote down my very [basic notes], more about the ecosystem and
  learning resources than the language itself. It might seem obvious
  once you're deep in OCaml, but it actually was kind of confusing
  figuring out even the simplest lay of the land. This is kind of a
  silly soft question, but any suggestions for other tools, libraries,
  learning resources, things that would be nice to know about?
