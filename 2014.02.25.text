** Adrien Nader said:

Roughly one year ago, late Wojciech Meyer and I started working on the
integration of a set of patches aimed at enabling the OCaml compiler to
be used for cross-compilation.

Some of the patches so far have caused issues to some people. The goal
of this RFC and email thread is to raise awareness of the upcoming work
and its implications and also to start getting feedback as early as
possible. The patches should be handled through the github interface
which Gabriel Scherer mentionned a few weeks ago.


******************************** Note ********************************
The words "target", "host" and "build" below have the meaning that the
GNU project gives them when it comes to compilation.
When compiling an application or library:
- build: the system the compilation process runs on
- host: the system that will run the binaries that are built
- target: meaningless
When compiling a cross-compiler:
- build: the system the compilation process runs on
- host: the system that will run the binaries that are built (i.e. the
  cross-compiler)
- target: the system for which the cross-compiler builds binaries


*************************** Immediate Goals ***************************
- build "${target}-ocamlc", "${target}-ocamlopt", ..., i.e. a
  cross-compiler for ${target}
- typical cross-compilation of projects is expected to go through
  ocamlfind; in practice, oasis-based projects can be cross-compiled
  with no change


**************************** Further Goals ****************************
- cross-compile the compiler: build a native Windows toolchain on Linux
- canadian cross support: ${build}, ${target}, ${host} are all
  different, i.e. on Linux, build a toolchain that runs on Windows 64b
  but targets Windows 32b or a different architecture/OS like ARM Linux.


*************************** Current status ***************************
- the compiler makes few assumptions about the target; this is very
  good.
- build system is fairly large, has been in flux because of the
  separation of labltk and camlp4, supports both GNU make and BSD's
  makes (i.e. it uses no extension beyong POSIX), some things are split
  between "Makefile" and "Makefile.nt" (and for the ".nt" variant, only
  GNU make is supported and these files do use GNU make extensions).
- most of the patches I ended up with have been upstreamed; a couple
  hairy ones are left and one in particular caused issues when
  bootstrapping.


****************************** Approach ******************************

*** A cross-compiler requires a native toolchain of the same version ***
A working _native_ compiler toolchain of the _exact_ same version as the
cross-toolchain is needed, both when building the cross-toolchain and
when using it; the main reason was camlp4 but I believe it is still a
valid restriction


*** Give up the restriction to POSIX for makefiles ***
Either remove compatibility with BSD makes, or move GNU-make-isms to
"GNUMakefile", BSD-makes-isms to "BSDMakefile" and common data to
"Makefile.common" with the GNU/BSDMakefile files being the
"entrypoints".

The manual page for GNU make states (and mk is similar but with
BSDMakefile iirc):
  "If no -f option is  present, make  will  look for the makefiles
  GNUmakefile, makefile, and Makefile, in that order."

However, separating the code which benefits from the extension requires
that:
- the amount of non-shared code (i.e. the size of GNUmakefile and
  BSDMakefile files) is small and at least the data can be shared; this
  is meant for a few specific functions that are currently shelled-out
  because they are too difficult to write in POSIX make
- most BSDs, if not all, can be supported without workarounds, kludges
  or additional hurdles caused by their fragmentation (for instance,
  OpenBSD's pmake is 10-years late compared to NetBSD's and has
  several bugs that are long solved in NetBSD)


*** Use configure-defined variables instead of "ocaml{c,opt}"... ***
The creation of the cross-compiler will rely on a native toolchain on
${build}. As such, ./configure will locate that toolchain and store its
paths. This forbids any call like "./ocamlopt"; everything must rely on
the paths found by configure.


*** Use Int64.t in the compiler instead of Nativeint ***
Currently, OCaml uses Nativeint to handle all the integers in the code
that is being compiled. The "native" is for ${build}, not for ${target}.

With a 64b host and 32b target, OCaml will output its values over 64
bits in the assembly and ld will then complain and truncate them.

Move to Int64.t instead and delay the conversion to the right bitness
until code emiting. The following types change: Cmm.expression,
Cmm.data_item, Arch.specific_operation, Mach.operation. After that it's
mostly a matter of fixing the type errors (around 50); since I do not
have all the platforms that OCaml supports, I need to devise a way to
compile the files for the other architectures too as a quick test.

(types to change: Cmm.{expression,data_item}, Arch.specific_operation,
Mach.operation)

*** For bytecode, assume C libraries contain the required primitives ***

When doing linking for bytecode with -custom, OCaml will dlopen() the
corresponding library and dlsym() the primitive as an early check for
their availability at runtime.

Quite obviously, this fails for cross-compilation and the only solution
I can think of is to disable the check completely. I have already
written the corresponding patch; it adds 4 trivial lines and changes
one.

*** Devil is in the details ***

While I wish the list above was exhaustive, I know for sure that it
isn't, partly because some of the changes needed are implementation
details more than general approaches. Do not hesitate to ask for
clarification on anything you might wonder.

problems seems to make a good case for a patch.

Camlp4 was clearly the main component to require this but I have also
been wondering about ocamldoc and ocamldep which can break because of
new syntax.

For now this requirements is probably the safe approach. Note that this
restriction only checks for x.y.z versions, not for the tags than can
come after 'z'; it made working with trunk too difficult.

Also, as a packager, I prefer this. I find that the other approach makes
packaging more difficult.

OK; I liked pmake and its descendants, partly because of their clean
syntax with true flow control and thought it could be left as a
possibility. Anyway, I will take that route.

I believe you refer to configuring for host, populating boot and then
configuring again for target. It's something I hadn't thought of and
could work nicely. I need to experiment with this a bit and see how
things would work out.

I wish everyone (at least everyone doing devlopment) would have a 64b
machine but it's not the case unfortunately. ='( 

This is not an area in the compiler I know much, if any, about. This can
most probably be worked on separately from the other patches; if someone
wants to contribute and can do the changes, it will be much
appreciated. :)

I see no cross-platform solution either. However, I expect most people
to build natively before doing cross-compilation and that should catch
most link errors hopefully (that's a small consolation).

I had been pointed to them a few months ago. From what I can tell, these
patches to the compiler cannot be integrated upstream; they require
"manual" steps like "make -C dir/ foo && mv bar baz && make -C dir2" and
a few changes which can only apply to windows targets.

By the way, the patches I've worked on were not started by me. However I
cannot trace their path properly; as far as I can tell, they were
started in Fedora, then went through debian and then mxe.cc.

Looking at these pages, I notice that I forgot one component for the
patches: ocamlfind and build system integration. IOW, how to cross-build
libraries. I'll add that to the RFC.

Actually, the patches I have make it possible to link bytecode with
-custom; it's simply that the test that would fail for cross-compilation
is skipped.

Quite a while back I hacked the OCaml compiler to enable cross-
compilation.  It kinda-sorta worked, but it was obvious [at that time,
2008 apparently] that it would take a lot of work upstream to make the
compiler friendly to cross-compilation.

I haven't look at cross-compilation of OCaml since, although of course
I'm still working on Fedora packaging, Aarch64 porting &c so I am
still fairly familiar with the compiler build system & internals.

Anyway, not sure what you were hoping I could do, except wish you good luck!

2) InvarGenT v1.2: GADTs for invariants and postconditions
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-02/msg00121.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Lukasz Stafiniak announced:

I am pleased to release version 1.2 of InvarGenT, a system that infers
invariants and postconditions, and exports the corresponding GADTs-based
OCaml code.
<https://github.com/lukstafi/invargent/releases>

The highlight of this release is the AVL trees example see:
<https://github.com/lukstafi/invargent/blob/master/examples/avl_tree.gadt>
<https://github.com/lukstafi/invargent/blob/master/examples/avl_tree.gadti>.
target
InvarGenT finds out that the height of a rotated tree can be the same as
original tree or one bigger, the same fact for the tree with added
element, that the height of merger of two trees is at most one bigger
than that of the larger tree, and that removing an element can decrease
the height of a tree, by at most 1.

Changes:
* Several bug fixes.
* So-called "opti" relations: "k=min(m,n)" and "k=max(m,n)" in the
numerical sort.
* So-called "subopti" relations "k<=max(m,n)" and "min(m,n)<=k" in the
numerical sort.
* Less confusing syntax for existential types, "datatype" and "datacons"
keywords.
* Pattern-matching guards "when e1 <= e2", where e1 and "e2 are
expressions of type "Num".
* Positive assert clauses, "assert num e1 <= e2; ..." and "assert type
e1 = e2; ...".
* Flagship example: AVL trees with imbalance of 2 (based on the
implementation from OCaml standard library).

There are no Unix-domain sockets on Windows.

If you need local sockets, there are two possibilities:

1) Use Internet sockets on the loopback device (127.0.0.1)

2) Use named pipes, which work in a similar way as sockets, but have a
quite different API (btw, "named pipes" on Windows are fundamentally
different to "named pipes" on Unix). There are bindings for these in
Ocamlnet (Netsys_win32 module,
<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.7.3/doc/html-main/Netsys_win32.html>).

In any case, I'd recommend you read some background knowledge about the
possibilities of the OS, because there are some hidden traps.

Yes.

First for generating the correct artefacts with ocamlbuild you can refer
to these instructions:

    <https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues/51#issuecomment-30729675>

It uses ctypes so the stub C files is empty but ignore that, it also
uses pkg-config for getting the cflags but you should be able to read
through and simplify the myocamlbuild.ml if you don't need that.

For the opam package use or generate a .install file at the toplevel of
your distribution that will more or less look like this [1].

Feel free to ask further questions if you need to.  

Best,

Daniel

If you know the type of this string in advance, you can do so with
ocaml_plugin: <https://github.com/janestreet/ocaml_plugin>

You can try to compile and run the hello_world example of ocaml_plugin:
<https://github.com/janestreet/ocaml_plugin/blob/master/hello_world>

It has a Plugin_intf module to specify the type of module expected from
loaded file. For you, it should probably be:

module type S = sig
val equal : ('a * 'a) -> bool
end

Then you can use Ocaml_compiler module to dynamically load modules with
this signature as demonstrated in run.ml

6) OASIS 0.4.2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Sylvain Le Gall announced:

I just released OASIS v0.4.2.

  * Major changes:

    * Change BSD3 and BSD4 to BSD-3-clause and BSD-4-clause to comply with
      DEP5, add BSD-2-clause. BSD3 and BSD4 are still valid but marked as
      deprecated.
      More information:
      <http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/#license-specification>

    * Enhance .cmxs supports through the generation of .mldylib files.
      When one of the modules of a library has the name of the library,
      ocamlbuild tends to just transform this module into a .cmxs. Now, the use
      of a .mldylib fix that problem and the .cmxs really contains all modules
      of the library.

    * Refactor oasis.cli to be able to create subcommand plugins.
      * Exported modules starts now with CLI.
      * Display plugins in the manual.
      * Design so that it is possible to be thread-safe.
      * Try to minimize the number of functions.
      * Make better choice of name and API.
      * A subcommand plugin 'dist' to create tarball is in preparation, as a
        separate project.

    * Remove plugin-list subcommand, this command was limited and probably not
      used. A better alternative will appear in next version.

    * Sub-command setup-dev is now hidden and will soon be removed.

  * Minor changes:

    * Refactor ocamlbuild build plugin to have some features in doc plugin.
      XOCamlbuilExtraArgs and XOCamlbuildPluginTags are now available for
      Document. The flag '-use-ocamlfind' is set for doc and build plugin.

    * Reorganize the test/data directory, each toplevel test has now its
      dedicated subdirectory in test/data.

    * Start to work on better support of syntax extension:
      * Remove archive(syntax,{byte,native}) from the META, this was causing
        an issue when trying to compile.
      * Add an example that creates a syntax extension.
      * Add support for auto-guessing syntax_camlp4o when one of the syntax
        extension shipped with camlp4 is in a build depends.

    * Allow to include $(X) in CCOpt/CClib.
      This patch helps to enable variable susbtitution for flags. This allow to
      write a PostConfCommand script to insert this data in setup.data and have
      them back when running OCamlbuild.

    * Raise error when "true" or "false" are not spelled correctly.

    * Fix some warnings about "Field X is set but matcing plugin Z is not enabled."

Leo White put together a custom compiler frontend for just this use
case a while back:

<https://github.com/lpw25/ocaml-with-pp>

The idea is that you build this with a static set of camlp4 extensions,
and it runs the input through camlp4 and then passes the AST directly
through to the compiler (via compiler-libs). 

It should be reasonably easy to adapt this to a toplevel model
as well -- let us know if you need a hand.
      
** Andy Ray then added:

A good amount of hacking and I have some camlp4 code running via js_of_ocaml.

I basically took the compilation process of camlp4orf, added pa_js.cmo
and slightly modified the driver program so it took a static command
line of the form `-str "let a = b##c"`.  Also needed a bit of hacking
around temp file generation.

My next step is to try and figure out a way to get camlp4 to transform
"string -> string" rather than "hacked js_of_ocaml psuedo file ->
hacked console log in browser".  Can't say I ever really wanted to
know much about the insides of camlp4, but there you go....

One thing I noticed was when I (accidentally) had unix_isatty
returning false, and presumably camlp4 attempting to marshal a
compiler ast the js_of_ocaml runtime would die with a JSON error.  I
presume this is an issue with js_of_ocaml's marshalling code?

As modified version of bisect as not been released yet, you need to
install it from sources. I uploaded it on my website, so you can use
this archive directly. See an example of how to install it on travis
here: <https://github.com/sagotch/ocveralls/blob/master/.travis-ci.sh#L24>

Compile your project as usual, and call the script as you would call
bisect-report, omitting the output format/name parameters. Examples
here: <https://github.com/sagotch/ocveralls/blob/master/.travis.yml#L11>
or here: <https://github.com/pastek-project/pastek/blob/master/.travis.yml#L11>

Any comment or improvement (pull request would be the best) is welcome.

Any confirmation that it works on other platform than travis-ci would be great.
