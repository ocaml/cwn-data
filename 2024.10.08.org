* Releases of fpath-sexplib0, fpath-base, loc, file-rewriter, sexps-rewriter and provider
:PROPERTIES:

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/releases-of-fpath-sexplib0-fpath-base-loc-file-rewriter-sexps-rewriter-and-provider/15364/1

** Mathieu Barbin announced


I wanted to announce the initial release of 6 utility packages to the opam-repository. They are dependencies to some other ongoing projects I have, perhaps some will find them useful.

These are very early days for this software. Please feel welcome to opening issues or discussions tickets if you are inclined.

Thank you @mseri , @avsm & @shonfeder for your help in making these libraries available!

Below you'll find short descriptions with links to the packages home pages. Thank you!

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/fpath-base][Fpath_sexplib0]] only depends on ~fpath~ and ~sexplib0~. It defines a single module, ~Fpath_sexplib0~, which is designed to be opened to shadow the ~Fpath~ module to add small helpers and a ~sexp_of~ serializer to it. The package also introduces three new modules to the scope: ~Fpart~, ~Absolute_path~ and ~Relative_path~ to increase type-safety when manipulating paths that are known to be relative or absolute.

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/fpath-base][Fpath_base]] further extends ~fpath-sexplib0~ and adds a dependency on base. It is designed to be compatible with Base-style containers such as ~Map~, ~Set~, ~Hashtbl~, ~Hash_set~.

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/loc][Loc]] is an OCaml library to manipulate code locations, which are ranges of lexing positions from a parsed file.

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/file-rewriter][File_rewriter]] is an OCaml library for applying small rewrites to tweak or refactor your files. It provides a convenient interface to apply surgical textual substitutions on the fly, while navigating the contents of a file through an abstract representation containing code locations.

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/file-rewriter][Sexps_rewriter]] is a specialized version of the ~file-rewriter~ library dedicated to rewriting sexp files, such as dune config files.

[[https://github.com/mbarbin/provider][Provider]] is an OCaml library for creating Traits and Interfaces. It allows you to define the functionality needed by a library without committing to a specific implementation - in essence : dynamic dispatch. Provider is a pattern featured in the ~Eio~ project (~Eio.Resource~). I wanted to make it reusable in other projects - in particular I am currently using it as the parametrization story of ~vcs~. This package had already been available for a little while already but was still unannounced.
      



* Build a project without Stdlib
:PROPERTIES:

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/build-a-project-without-stdlib/15374/1

** Mikhail announced


I decided to experiment with compiling a project without the standard library. Why? I don't know. But I could save ~50K. Just sharing my note about it.

You can find an example in my [[https://github.com/dx3mod/ocaml-without-stdlib][repository]].

I found the ~-nostdlib~ and ~-nopervasives~ (undocumented) flags and after a lot of trying I was able to do what I wanted. It doesn't disable absolutely everything (lists and other types like ~option~ are available).

#+begin_example
(flags
  :standard
  -nostdlib
  -nopervasives
  ; add runtime
  -cclib
  -lasmrun
  -ccopt
  "-L %{ocaml_where}"
  -ccopt
  "-lm -ldl")
#+end_example

#+begin_src ocaml
(* stdlib.ml *)
external print_endline : string -> unit = "caml_print_endline" [@@noalloc]

(* main.ml *)
open Stdlib
let () = print_endline "hello from my stdlib"
#+end_src

Hello World program:

* obatcher: Framework for building efficient concurrent services
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-obatcher-framework-for-building-efficient-concurrent-services/15384/1

** Lee Koon Wen announced


Hot on the heels of the paper [[https://koonwen.github.io/assets/pdf/concurrent-structures-made-easy.pdf][/"Concurrent Data Structures Made Easy"/]] appearing at [[https://2024.splashcon.org/details/splash-2024-oopsla/118/Concurrent-Data-Structures-Made-Easy][OOPSLA 2024]] on the 24th October, I'm pleased to announce release of *obatcher* - a _picos_ compatible library for implementing efficient batched services in OCaml.

*obatcher* proposes a *new* way to approach the design and implementation of concurrent services. It's key benefits are:

- Incremental optimization and parallelism of services
- Easy to control and reason about concurrency
- Retains atomic-style interface with your services while batching happens implicitly
- Thread-safety for cheap!

Available on opam today, install with
#+begin_example
opam install obatcher
#+end_example

For more details, check out the source and README on GitHub: [[https://github.com/koonwen/obatcher][obatcher]].

Feedback, contributions, and discussions are welcome!
      



* DBLP query program and library
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dblp-query-program-and-library/15385/1

** Samuel Mimram announced


I am happy to announce the first realease of [[https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-dblp][ocaml-dblp]], which provides both a program and a library to query the [[https://dblp.org/][DBLP]] bibliographic database. In practice, it is mostly useful for retrieving bibtex entries with commands such as

#+begin_example
dblp bibtex girard locus solum
#+end_example

which will spit out

#+begin_src bibtex
@article{DBLP:journals/mscs/Girard01,
  author       = {Jean{-}Yves Girard},
  title        = {Locus Solum: From the rules of logic to the logic of rules},
  journal      = {Math. Struct. Comput. Sci.},
  volume       = {11},
  number       = {3},
  pages        = {301--506},
  year         = {2001},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S096012950100336X},
  doi          = {10.1017/S096012950100336X},
  timestamp    = {Wed, 01 Apr 2020 08:48:47 +0200},
  biburl       = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/mscs/Girard01.bib},
  bibsource    = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}
}
#+end_src

(or, even better, use ~dblp bib~ to directly add this at the end of the ~.bib~ file in the current directory).

It might still need some polishing, feel free to reach out if you encounter some problems.

** Lukasz Stafiniak announced


cudajit 0.5.0 is now available in the opam repository. It's organized into [[https://lukstafi.github.io/ocaml-cudajit/cudajit/Cudajit/index.html][modules]], and it adds support for CUDA events.
      



* YOCaml, a framework for static site generator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-yocaml-a-framework-for-static-site-generator/15393/1

** Xavier Van de Woestyne announced


:wave: Hello everyone! We, the YOCaml development team, are very pleased to announce the release of [[https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/releases/tag/v2.0.0][version 2]], freshly merged into [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository][opam-repository]] :champagne:! 

*YOCaml is a framework for describing static site generators* (a very small applicative build-system whose API is tailor-made for creating web pages ) and its internal model is very similar to [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] (the 3th version), another Haskell framework. (a presentation was given to the OCaml user Group in Paris and you can find the video, [[https://www.irill.org/videos/OUPS/2023-01/xavier-van-de-woestyne.html][in French, here]]).

*** Changes with 1.0.0

Historically, YOCaml was written very, very quickly to give examples of slightly exotic uses of the library [[https://github.com/xvw/preface][Preface]]. Due to its experimental nature, the API was a bit laborious, but we did find some users! We took advantage of the redesign to stop relying on Preface (and yes, YOCaml was already more widely used than Preface), move to OCaml 5.x and take advantage of _user-defined-effects_ and support dynamic dependencies. In other words, YOCaml ~2.0.0~ is not at all compatible with version 1...

*** Plugins and runtimes

The aim of YOCaml is to be very generic and to allow users to bring their own dependencies, but we've taken the opportunity to release it with several plugins and runtimes so that it can be used directly.

**** Runtimes

A Runtime is an ‘execution context’ and generally exposes the primitive used to execute a YOCaml program. YOCaml 2 is bundled with 3 Runtimes:

- *Yocaml_unix*: the default runtime, whose preview server is implemented on top of the brand new [[https://github.com/robur-coop/httpcats][httpcats]]!

- *Yocaml_eio*: a runtime iso to Unix but based on [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio][eio]] and whose preview server is described by [[https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp][cohttp_eio]].

- *Yocaml_git*: a parameterised runtime for generating a site directly in a git repository, which can be served, for example, by a [[https://mirage.io/][Mirage]] ([[https://github.com/robur-coop/unipi][unipi]]), very well documented in this [[https://blog.osau.re/articles/blog_requiem.html][excellent article]] by @dinosaure!

**** Plugins

- *Yocaml_cmarkit* provides a convenient API (via YOCaml) for converting Markdown files to HTML via the excellent [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmarkit][cmarkit]] library.

- *Yocaml_omd* provides a convenient API (via YOCaml) for converting Markdown files to HTML via the excellent [[https://github.com/ocaml/omd][OMD]] library (but we recommend ~yocaml_cmarkit~).

- *yocaml_yaml* provides a convenient API (via YOCaml) for reading Yaml via the excellent library [[https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-yaml][ocaml-yaml]]

- *yocaml_otoml* provides a convenient API (for YOCaml) for reading TOML via the excellent library [[https://github.com/dmbaturin/otoml][Otoml]]

- *yocaml_mustache* provides a convenient API (via YOCaml) for using [[https://mustache.github.io/][Mustache]] as a template language via the excellent library [[https://github.com/rgrinberg/ocaml-mustache][ocaml-mustache]]

- *yocaml_jingoo* provides a convenient API (via YOCaml) for using [[http://tategakibunko.github.io/jingoo/][Jingoo]] as a template language via the excellent library [[https://github.com/tategakibunko/jingoo][jingoo]]

- *yocaml_syndication* that gives tool to generate feeds ([Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS][RSS]] 1 and 2 and [[https://opml.org/][OPML]]). The library is inspired by [[https://github.com/Cumulus/Syndic][Syndic]] but does not depend directly on it.

*** A final word

YOCaml 2 was mainly written by [[https://github.com/xhtmlboi][xhtmlboi]], helped by [[https://github.com/gr-im][gr-im]], [[https://github.com/mspwn][mspwn]] and [[https://github.com/dinosaure][dinosaure]] with occasional support from [[https://github.com/maiste][maiste]]. It has already been used experimentally in a number of small projects:

- [[https://ring.muhokama.fun][Ring.muhokama]] a very small webring - [[https://github.com/muhokama/ring][sources]]
- [[https://maiste.fr][Maiste.fr]] - [[https://github.com/maiste/maiste.fr][sources]]
- [[https://gr-im.github.io][gr-im.github.io]] - [[https://github.com/gr-im/site][sources]]

You will also find extensively documented examples in the [[https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/tree/main/examples][examples]] directory.

To conclude, we find (not very objectively) that YOCaml is a lot of fun to use, and it's very cool to make your site using as much OCaml as possible. 

Happy Hacking!

* ppx_deriving_router — type safe routing for Dream and Melange
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ppx-deriving-router-type-safe-routing-for-dream-and-melange/15401/1

** Andrey Popp announced


It's my pleasure to announce a new ppx for deriving [[https://aantron.github.io/dream/][Dream]] routers based on variant type declarations, [[https://github.com/andreypopp/ppx_deriving_router][ppx_deriving_router]].

A small example. First we define routes (the signature showcases the generated code):
#+begin_src ocaml
module Pages : sig
  ...

  val href : t -> string
  (** generate URL from the route *)

  val http_method : t -> [ `DELETE | `GET | `POST | `PUT ]
  (** HTTP method for the route *)

  val handle : (t -> Dream.handler) -> Dream.handler
  (** create a route handler *)
end = struct
  open Ppx_deriving_router_runtime.Primitives

  type t =
    | Home [@GET "/"]
    | About
    | Hello of { name : string; repeat : int option } [@GET "/hello/:name"]
    [@@deriving router]
end
#+end_src

Then we describe how we handle each route:
#+begin_src ocaml
let handle =
  Pages.handle (fun route _req ->
      match route with
      | Home -> Dream.respond "Home page!"
      | About -> Dream.respond "About page!"
      | Hello { name; repeat } ->
          let name =
            match repeat with
            | Some repeat ->
                List.init repeat (fun _ -> name) |> String.concat ", "
            | None -> name
          in
          Dream.respond (Printf.sprintf "Hello, %s" name))

let () = Dream.run ~interface:"127.0.0.1" ~port:8080 handle
#+end_src

Using generated ~Pages.href~ function we can generate URLs for routes:
#+begin_src ocaml
let () =
  assert (Pages.href Home = "/");
  assert (Pages.href About = "/about");
  assert (Pages.href (Hello { name = "world"; repeat = None }) = "/hello/world");
  assert (Pages.href (Hello { name = "world"; repeat = Some 3 }) = "/hello/world?repeat=3")
#+end_src

The URL matching is done by [[https://anuragsoni.github.io/routes/][routes]] library.

There's also support for [[https://github.com/andreypopp/ppx_deriving_router#routes-with-typed-responses][routes that track their response types]] and the ppx automatically derives JSON encoders and decoders for them (by using [[https://github.com/melange-community/melange-json?tab=readme-ov-file#ppx-for-melange][melange-json.ppx]]).

On top of that a [[https://github.com/andreypopp/ppx_deriving_router#using-with-melange][separate ppx is provided]] for [[https://melange.re/][Melange]] which allows to construct type safe HTTP clients (route defintions are shared between server and client).

Happy hacking!
      



* Mica, a PPX that automates differential testing for OCaml modules

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mica-a-ppx-that-automates-differential-testing-for-ocaml-modules/15406/1

** Ernest Ng announced


I'm delighted to announce the initial release of [[https://github.com/ngernest/mica][Mica]], a PPX deriver that automates differential testing for a pair of OCaml modules implementing the same signature. Users annotate module signatures with the directive ~[@@deriving mica]~, and at compile-time, Mica derives specialized [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmA9qhaECcE][property-based testing]] (PBT) code that checks if two modules implementing the signature are observationally equivalent. (Under the hood, Mica uses Jane Street's [[https://blog.janestreet.com/quickcheck-for-core/][~Core.Quickcheck~]] PBT library.)

Mica was presented at the OCaml Workshop '24 ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14561][paper]]) and the ICFP '23 Student Research Competition ([[https://ngernest.github.io/pdfs/mica_icfp23src_poster.pdf][poster]]). 

*Note*: Mica is currently a research tool and should not be used in production code, although contributions are very welcome!

Mica is available on Opam: 
#+begin_example
opam update 
opam install ppx_mica
#+end_example
(OCaml 5.1 or newer is required.)

Docs are available [[https://ngernest.github.io/mica/ppx_mica/index.html][here]], and a simple web app demo-ing Mica is available [[https://ngernest.github.io/mica/demo.html][here]].
      



* Simplified Android cross-compiler with DkML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 10
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-simplified-android-cross-compiler-with-dkml/15407/1

** jbeckford announced


DkML has had a cross-compiler for years, but I have cleaned it up so that it is much easier to use for Android developers. It *now works with a regular opam installation in a custom repository*. Also included are patches to the OCaml compiler to work with Android NDK 21+ (currently Google is at NDK 27).

Try it out if you do Android development ... just copy-and-paste the instructions below ... but please read the notes and cautions below. And if you are still interested in Android development, tell me so I can decide if I'll merge the packages into the regular opam repository.

Trimmed slightly from the [[https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-compiler?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start][dkml-compiler Quick Start]]:

- Docker container is used below for Windows and macOS users, and because it is easy to get the Android NDK from CircleCI.
- Apple Silicon does not support 32-bit. The net effect is that Apple Silicon users cannot cross-compile ~android_arm32v7a~.

#+begin_example
$ docker run -it --rm cimg/android:2024.10.1-ndk

#+end_example

DkML supports three out of the four supported Android ABIs. The three ABIs (all but ~x86~) were chosen based on [[https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/1772#issuecomment-1697831518][statistics for a large game on Aug 29, 2023]]:

| Arch        | Percent |
|----------- | ------- |
| arm64-v8a   | 68.66   |
| armeabi-v7a | 30.38   |
| x86_64      | 0.71    |
| x86         | 0.26    |

and also [[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/64-bit-only-devices.html][Google's recommendation]]:

*Note*: While 64-bit-only devices will grow in popularity with phones joining Android Auto in this group, 32-bit-only devices will continue to be important for Android Go, Android TV, and Android Wear. Please continue supporting 32-bit ABIs; Google Play will continue serving 32-bit apps to 32-bit-only devices.

Finally, a word of *CAUTION*. The Android cross-compiler /can never/ use OCaml 5+ because [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/32-bit-native-code-support-for-ocaml-5/12583/13?u=jbeckford][OCaml 5 will never bring back the 32-bit instruction set]]. That means if you don't want to drop a large percent of your users or drop new Android categories over the next five (?) years, you will have a critical dependency on DkML.
