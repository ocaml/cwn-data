The example below shows GC behaviour which in my view is somewhat
weird: I am building two very similar sorts of hash tables that map
variant types to strings. The parameter "works" (which gets passed
through from the "demo" to the "setup" function) allows one to choose,
when calling the script, whether it behaves properly or shows weird
behaviour.

For Rtag, inlining get_rtag does not make a difference, but for Ftag,
inlining the get_ftag call breaks things both with the interpreter and
compiler, but in different ways.

So... my question is: is there a documented reliable way to avoid this
sort of funny behaviour?!?

=================================
type funny_tag = Ftag of string;;

type funny_ref = Rtag of string ref;;

let get_ftag s = Ftag s;;

let get_rtag s = Rtag (ref s);;

let fin_str ht k =
  let Ftag s = k in
  let () = Printf.printf "Removing str '%s'\n%!" s in
  Hashtbl.remove ht k
;;

let fin_ref ht k =
  let Rtag rs = k in
  let () = Printf.printf "Removing ref '%s'\n%!" !rs in
  Hashtbl.remove ht k
;;


let setup works =
  let ht_str = Hashtbl.create 17 in
  let ht_ref = Hashtbl.create 17 in
  let (funny_str, funny_ref) =
  if works
    then (get_ftag "funny",get_rtag "funny")
    else (Ftag "funny", Rtag (ref "funny"))
  in
(* Note that they keys used below are equal but not identical to the entities above *) 
  let () = Hashtbl.add ht_str (Ftag "funny") "situation" in
  let () = Hashtbl.add ht_ref (Rtag (ref "funny")) "situation" in
  let () = Gc.finalise (fin_str ht_str) funny_str in
  let () = Gc.finalise (fin_ref ht_ref) funny_ref in
  ((ht_str,ht_ref),(funny_str,funny_ref))
;;

let left (p,q) = p;;

let demo works =
  let (ht_str,ht_ref) = left (setup works) in
(* Note that I drop the references on the keys that have finalizers registered. *) 
  let () = Gc.full_major () in
  let () = Gc.compact () in
Printf.printf "ht_str entries: %d ht_ref entries: %d\n%!" (Hashtbl.length ht_str) (Hashtbl.length ht_ref) 
;;

let () = demo (Array.length Sys.argv &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; Sys.argv.(1) = "magic");;

&gt; For Rtag, inlining get_rtag does not make a difference, but for Ftag,
&gt; inlining the get_ftag call breaks things both with the interpreter and
&gt; compiler, but in different ways.

That's the key.

&gt;  if works
&gt;    then (get_ftag "funny",get_rtag "funny")
&gt;    else (Ftag "funny", Rtag (ref "funny"))
&gt;  in

In this expression, you have four interesting subexpressions.  Three of
them involve calling some function with "funny" as argument, and these
functions allocate values that point to the "funny" string.  These values
are heap-allocated and behave as you expect.

The fourth one is (Ftag "funny").  This is a constant expression and its
evaluation does not allocate in the heap.  Since it's constant, it's
allocated once by the compiler, and every time you execute this code
it's the same value that is returned.

In byte-code it's still allocated in the heap, but at load-time, and
a reference to it is hidden in the closure of the enclosing function.
Hence, it never gets deallocated:

&gt; $ ocaml gc_bug.ml
&gt; Removing ref 'funny'
&gt; ht_str entries: 1 ht_ref entries: 0

You don't get the "Removing str 'funny'" message because the value
stays alive throughout program execution.

In native code, it's even more optimized: the value is "allocated" at
compile time as constant data outside the heap.  Hence, you can't even
register a finalizer for it:

&gt; $ ocamlopt -o gc_bug gc_bug.ml
&gt; 
&gt; $ ./gc_bug
&gt; Fatal error: exception Invalid_argument("Gc.finalise")


Only heap data can be finalized.

So you have to be aware of the difference between (get_ftag "funny") and
(Ftag "funny") because they don't have exactly the same semantics: a call
to get_ftag is guaranteed to allocate a new block each time.
      </pre><i>Thomas Fischbacher then asked and Damien Doligez replied:</i><br /><pre>
Others have mostly answered your questions, but to be complete I want
to add the following:

&gt; How come (Ftag "funny") is regarded as constant while
&gt; (Rtag (ref "funny")) is not?

The difference here is that (ref "funny") is a function call.  The
compiler doesn't know that the "ref" function just allocates a record.

&gt; After all, strings are mutable in OCaml,
&gt; so there really is not that much of a conceptual difference between a
&gt; string and a string ref in that respect:

You should rather look at the analogy between strings and arrays, but
as Gabriel said, string literals are very rarely mutated in practice,
so it makes more sense to have "funny" return the same string instead
of allocating.

&gt; But the problem I think I have with OCaml is: there just seems to be no
&gt; way to properly express the conceptual difference between '(1 2 3 4 5)
&gt; and (list 1 2 3 4 5): All I can say above is: Ftag "Hello".

You should say (Ftag (String.copy "Hello")) if you want a fresh mutable
string.  I wouldn't recommend appending "" or using Obj.dup (yuck!)

I agree it was a mistake to make strings mutable, but we have to live
with it for the time being.  If you want to be perfectly safe, you can
wrap all string literals with String.copy in your program.

This mail announces the new release of ODT: 2.0. 
ODT (OCaml Development Tools) is an Eclipse plug-in for OCaml.

Yes, ODT is still alive. All releases are not always announced on this 
mailing list, as ODT might not be enough developed to be really useful
for industrial developments.

However, after a long period of development and tests, the 2.0 release
came out. It brings new functionalities, like separate and conditional 
compilation and camlp4 support. It also becomes more mature.

ODT needs a lot of feedback to be more robust, and also to decide
the development priorities.

Don't hesitate to try ODT, even for fun. ODT can be installed as explained
into the install notes (<a href="http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?article5">http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?article5</a>). 
The tutorial has also been rewritten and screenshots have been updated.
The release news (with more technical information) is available at 
<a href="http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?breve23">http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?breve23</a>.

We are pleased to announce a users group for OCaml programmers in the
New York City area. Our goal is simply to have a forum where OCaml
programmers can connect with each other when desired. Everyone is
welcome to host a talk on any OCaml related topic, propose a casual
get together just to meet people, or anything else you think OCaml
programmers will want to do.

We are hosting the group on meetup.com:
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-OCaml/">http://www.meetup.com/NYC-OCaml/</a>. The site is configured to let anyone
create an event on their own, but feel free to contact the organizers
first if you would like.

Our first meetup is scheduled for Oct 12, where we will discuss Ocsigen.

I am pleased and relieved to announce lablgtk-react, a project to ease
the use of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) for lablgtk-based
graphical user interfaces.

Currently, the project is available as a preview but I am happy with the
way it is looking and with the programming style it offers and have
decided to announce it in order to receive feedback and comments.
Installation is not perfect and best thing for new codes is to try from
the src/tests directory.

Put simply, FRP makes it possible to write functional code whose inputs
and arguments originate from imperative event sources. For instance, you
can have a button and execute functional code each time it is clicked,
carrying a state of the button between presses. As such, it really only
benefits functional languages.

Currently, the source distribution contains one example: browser_test.
It creates a tab-based web browser where tabs are elements in a zipper
and are themselves updated in a functional way. The state which models
the browsing session is currently quite simple: the page title and the
page URI. However, the page title is shown in the tab label and in the
window title, it is also possible to move tabs around and the code is
_simple_.

My ultimate goal is to make a browser that I can call "intelligent" and
spend time on the interesting part instead of becoming mad because of
the UI.

Also, don't forget that OCaml is multi-paradigm: choose the right one for
each task and don't hesitate to mix them.

The only dependency is lablgtk2. You can use any FRP implementation that
provides "create" and "fold" (a very simple and mostly untested one is
provided as "MiniFRP" in the source). The example uses lablwebkit[1].

The project website includes some more infos and a longer introduction:
  <a href="http://lablgtk-react.forge.ocamlcore.org">http://lablgtk-react.forge.ocamlcore.org</a>

[1] lablwebkit-1.4.0 (compatible with webkit-gtk &gt;= 1.4.0) is available at
  <a href="http://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/download.php/702/lablwebkit-1.4.0.tar.gz">http://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/download.php/702/lablwebkit-1.4.0.tar.gz</a>
      </pre><i>He later added:</i><br /><pre>
I forgot to mention that you need lablgtk2's adrien/mix branch for the
examples (and only for the examples iirc).

There are two reasons. It uses some additional API, especially
#as_something methods and "notify::foo" signals. lablwebkit also
requires a bug fix that it not merged into master yet.

Also, godi users are a bit privileged with lablgtk and lablwebkit
since they have an option in lablgtk's configuration to use the
sources from the <a href="http://git.ocamlcore.org/lablgtk/lablgtk.git">http://git.ocamlcore.org/lablgtk/lablgtk.git</a> git repo
and the adrien/mix branch directly.
For lablwebkit, <a href="http://notk.org/~adrien/godi-lablwebkit.tar.gz">http://notk.org/~adrien/godi-lablwebkit.tar.gz</a> can be
extracted to $GODIPREFIX/build/godi, along with the sources I linked
being put in $GODIPREFIX/build/distfiles.

Generally speaking, installation of lablwebkit is done through
ocamlfind and you will need the various development packages for
webkit-gtk in case your distribution splits packages.

Packaging of everything will be improved over the time of course (use
of OASIS everywhere is planned).
