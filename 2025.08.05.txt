  Hello everyone! I've just published my first midpoint Outreachy blog
  post about my progress contributing to Dune. You can read it here:
  <https://medium.com/@mattidungafa/outreachy-internship-midpoint-post-f9333c9c3c86>. Stay
  tuned for more updates!

  Version 0.9 of `qcheck-lin', `qcheck-stm', and
  `qcheck-multicoretests-util' is now available from your favorite opam
  repository! :tada:

  The 0.9 release contains adjustments to the public interface of `Lin'
  in order to make it compatible with `5.5.0+trunk' and also switches
  the `Util.Pp' pretty printers to use `QCheck.Print' for consistency:

  • [#566]: Use `QCheck.Print' combinators in `Util.Pp' too for
    consistency, e.g., to avoid that `STM' argument and result printer
    outputs differ.

  • [#562]: Fix the `int32' and `int64' printers in both `Lin' and `STM'
    to add missing `l' and `L' suffixes on literals.

  • [#560]: Change `Lin.{constructible,deconstructible}' from an empty
    variant type to an abstract type to get `Lin' compiling on
    `5.5.0+trunk' again, due to [ocaml/ocaml#13994] removing special
    handling of abstract and empty variants defined in the current
    module.

  Happy testing! :smiley:

  I just published a blog post about CRs Workflows, a new open source
  tool for managing code review comments embedded in source code, with
  reusable GitHub Actions workflows. If you’re interested in trying it
  out or sharing feedback, you can read more here:
  <https://mbarbin.github.io/crs/blog/launching-crs-workflows/>.

  Thank you!


OCaml version of the "Build systems à la carte" paper
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-version-of-the-build-systems-a-la-carte-paper/17042/1>


jbeckford announced

  There is a great paper distilling several different build systems
  (Make, Excel, Bazel, etc.) into a unified framework. One of its
  authors is on the Dune team (I think). If you want to understand or
  write build systems, it is a good read because it uses language that
  can be understood by non-academics:

  <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/build-systems-a-la-carte-theory-and-practice/097CE52C750E69BD16B78C318754C7A4>

  All of its examples are in Haskell so I wrote a version in OCaml. Most
  of my OCaml translation was aided by the English paragraphs rather
  than the Haskell code (the latter was hieroglyphics to
  me). Regardless, I’m fairly sure some of the concepts don’t translate
  to OCaml well.

  If you are interested in build systems, the first place to start is
  the test directory
  <https://gitlab.com/dkml/build-tools/MlFront/-/tree/V2_4/tests/MlFront_Thunk?ref_type=heads>
  (the `alacarte_*.ml' modules). The tests correspond to the paper’s
  section numbers, although there are also `alacarte_x*.ml' tests where
  I extended the framework. Then you can scan the source code at
  <https://gitlab.com/dkml/build-tools/MlFront/-/tree/V2_4/src/MlFront_Thunk?ref_type=heads>
  (the `Build*.ml' and `Promise.ml' modules).

  PRs welcome!


Dream development open video call

  Greetings!

  We are planning to host the first Dream development video call with
  @sabine on Discord on Friday, 8 August, at 9:00 AM Berlin time.

  Please join [#webdev] on the OCaml Discord if you’d like to
  participate. I will handle questions about joining the meeting
  there. We will probably use one of the voice chat channels on the
  server (which supports video).

  The topic of the meeting will be discussing open PRs and getting them
  ready for merge by our collective efforts, and needed improvements. We
  would like to put off conceptual and strategic discussions until the
  very end of the meeting, or to a future date.

  And please bear with us as we figure out what platform is best to use
  and how to use it :) We can’t promise that the first meeting will go
  without any issues, but we will work out everything based on
  experience :)

  Hope to see you there!
