      <cwn_title>Mirage 3.7.1 released</cwn_title>

      <cwn_what>
MirageOS 3.7.1 is released to opam repository now.

Breaking change:
- The hooks previously defined in OS.Main.at_enter/at_enter_iter/at_exit/at_exit_iter are now part of Mirage_runtime (only used by mirage-entropy) https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/1010

Behaviour changes of MirageOS unikernels:
- A unikernel now always calls the Mirage_runtime.at_exit registered hooks -- once a unikernel succesfully executed its ~start~ in ~Lwt_main.run~, ~exit 0~ is called to ensure this behaviour https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/1011
- Top-level exceptions are no longer caught (there used to be in mirage-unix/mirage-xen/mirage-solo5 custom handlers). The OCaml runtime prints the exception and backtrace on stdout and calls exit 2 (from 4.10.0, abort() will be called).

Deprecations (being removed from Mirage 4.0)
- All Mirage_YYY_lwt are deprecated, Mirage_YYY interfaces are no longer astracted over 'a io and buffer. This reduces the amount of opam packages - mirage-yyy-lwt are no longer part of the release (each mirage-yyy package provides a Mirage_yyy_lwt module for backwards compatibility). Motivation was discussed in https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1004
- mirage-types and mirage-types-lwt are deprecated, please use the Mirage_YYY signatures directly instead.

Other observable changes
- ~mirage configure~ now deletes all exising opam files

Most reverse dependencies are already released to opam, have a look at
https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1012 for progress (and the
temporary https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev.git#easy opam overlay).
