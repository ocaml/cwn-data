We're happy to inform you that the first alpha version of OCaml
Batteries Included has just been released. You may find the source on
the Forge [1], as well as the release notes [2],  and you can browse the
documentation online, including a detailed presentation of what OCaml
Batteries Included is all about [3].  A GODI package has also been
uploaded for OCaml 3.10 .

The list of features is a tad too long for detailing it here. Let's just
say that there are new or improved data structures, i/o, unicode ropes,
syntax extensions, primitives for invoking some of the tools of the
toolchain, etc.

It's alpha-level code, so use with caution, and not all the features we
have in mind have been implemented yet. On the other hand, any form of
feedback is greatly appreciated.
