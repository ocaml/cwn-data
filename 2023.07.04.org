** Julien Girard announced


We are happy to announce the release of CAISAR 0.2, to celebrate (with one week delay) the 234th birthday of the
Serment du jeu de Paume. On this day, courageous people took a vow to abolish autocracy and fight for their rights.

This release is the result of more than one year of work. Here are some of the most prominent changes that we are
happy to share. The release is available under our [[https://git.frama-c.com/pub/caisar/][gitlab]], on opam and on
Dockerhub. You may check our [[https://caisar-platform.github.io/website/][website]] for additional infos.

*** New prover support

We added the support of several provers:

- the alpha-beta-CROWNprover; winner of the 2021 and 2022 edition of the VNN-COMP
- the nnenumhttps://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum) prover
- the AIMOS metamorphic testing prover, for now internally developped at CEA

We also added support to the VNNLib standard. In the future, adding a VNNLib compliant prover to CAISAR would only
require to edit two small files, which is a huge step towards integrating more provers. This also results in
supporting all solvers that support the SMTLIB2 language (which VNNLib is a subset of). We implemented a custom
transformation in CAISAR that automatically translates the neural network control flow into a SMT formula. This
custom transformation had been tested for the CVC5 solver.

*** Manual

The first version of the CAISAR manual is available under the documentation section of our website. It includes
detailed installation instructions, a synopsis of common commands and two tutorials on classical benchmarks. The
current version of those tutorials make use of experimental features that we plan to document in a future release.
We hope this manual will provide a good entry point to CAISAR, and formal verification of machine learning programs
at large.

*** Usability

We added various utilities to make CAISAR slicker to use, such as several logging options, verification through a
JSON file, and reworked help messages.

We are also looking for fixed-term positions, intern and PhD students to work on CAISAR, check our website or the
ocaml job board for more infos.
      



* stdlib-random release 1.1.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-stdlib-random-release-1-1-0/12495/1

** octachron announced


The library ~stdlib-random~ is a small compatibility library that provides compiler-independent implementations of
the PRNGs used in the history of the standard library ~Random~:

- stdlib-random.v3: implement the PRNG used in OCaml 3.07 to 3.11
- stdlib-random.v4: implement the PRNG used in OCaml 3.12 to 4.14
- stdlib-random.v5: implement the PRNG currently used in OCaml 5
- stdlib-random.v5o: implement the PRNG currently used in OCaml 5 in pure OCaml

This library is targeted toward programs that need a deterministic and stable behavior of the ~Random~ module
across OCaml versions.

The newly released version 1.1.0 updates all implementations to provide the new PRNG state serialization functions
(~Random.State.to_binary_string~ and ~Random.State.of_binary_string~) that will be available in OCaml 5.1.0 .

** Etienne Millon announced


And here's the changelog for dune 3.8.3, just released, which fixes two important
bugs on Linux and Windows:

*** 3.8.3 (2023-06-27)

- Fix deadlock on Windows (#8044, @nojb)

- When using ~sendfile~ to copy files on Linux, fall back to the portable
  version if it fails at runtime for some reason (NFS, etc).
  (#8049, fixes #8041, @emillon)
      



* plotly release 1.0.0, a wrapper for Plotly open source graphing library

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-plotly-release-1-0-0-a-wrapper-for-plotly-open-source-graphing-library/12506/1

** Jun Furuse announced


I released an OPAM package plotly, a wrapper for [[https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/][Plotly Open Source Graphing
Library]].

It provides interfaces for 2 backends:

- "Python" version, using the Python library of Plotly via Pyml, for standalone programs
- "JSOO" version, using the JS library of Plotly via JSOO, for browsers

It supports only a few charts (scatter, scatter3d, bar, pie) and options currently,
but it should be easy to add more.  Enjoy!

* Help us Make the New Learn Area on OCaml.org Awesome
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/help-us-make-the-new-learn-area-on-ocaml-org-awesome/12508/1

** Sabine Schmaltz announced


I'm here to draw on your collective wisdom again!

Here's a work-in-progress draft of the new Learn Area landing page:

https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/ocaml/optimized/2X/a/a7191d72fd483e694ddd5e9e661d02cd78f6542d_2_308x1000.png

[[https://www.figma.com/proto/Aqk5y03fsaCuhTSywmmY06/OCaml.org-Public-Designs?type=design&node-id=130-767&t=7ICA3gfxHteFI0le-0&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=130%3A754][Design on
Figma]]

As you can see, there's still work to be done. For example, we're going to make the "Download" and the "Standard
Library" boxes a bit smaller. And, clearly, this design is using placeholder content.

All the design has been done with one thing in mind: Flexibility to arrange content in such a way that we can show
different groups of users what they need to see. We can rearrange and experiment with the blocks you see on the
page.

From the feedback we got in
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/you-started-to-learn-ocaml-less-than-12-months-ago-please-help-us-with-our-user-survey-on-the-ocaml-org-learning-area/11945/2,
we identified a common pattern that all good programming language documentation pages have:

There is a progression from beginner content to advanced content, focused clearly on the things that people need to
learn to be productive with the language.

Now... here's what I ask you to do: Imagine *which documentation do we have to give people* here on the main page
of the Learn Area *to make them happy and productive* with OCaml:
1. Which topics would have to be covered by the "tutorial blocks"?
2. Which books do we feature?

The point of the main page of the Learn area is to quickly guide people into the direction they may be interested
in.

*Your feedback directly helps us prioritize the creation of missing documentation and helps us rearrange & improve the existing documentation.* Please do be specific and give us titles for the pages you want to see, as well as a
short description about what the user would find there.
      



* Sedlex 3.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-sedlex-3-2/12513/1

** Romain Beauxis announced


Sedlex 3.2 is out! 🎉

Sedlex is a unicode-friendly lexer generator for OCaml originally written by Alain Frisch at LexiFi and now
maintained under the [[https://github.com/ocaml-community][ocaml-community]] umbrella.

You read the notes for this release here: https://github.com/ocaml-community/sedlex/releases/tag/v3.2 and an
updated ~opam~ package should [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/24027][be available soon]].

This release brings improvements on a couple of fronts:
- Better performance when parsing in-memory strings (up to ~20x~ on large ones!)
- Cleaned up logic with better ~MalFormed~ error reporting
- A new position API returning positions in bytes rather than code points.

The last point might be of interest to most users of the library. It is in fact quite likely that a lot of users
were already expecting the existing position API to return positions in bytes. If so, feel free to upgrade to this
version!
      



* dune 3.9.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-9-0/12530/1

** Etienne Millon announced


The Dune team is pleased to announce the release of Dune 3.9.0. It comes with
many new features, including:

- a new ~dune show~ command to display various pieces of information.
- some fixes in the dialect support that will make it easier to work with Dream's eml files
- a new ~(build_if)~ toggle in the ~(test)~ stanza which will help packaging nonportable tests and benchmarks.

*** Added

- Include the time it takes to read/write state files when ~--trace-file~ is
  enabled (#7960, @rgrinberg)

- Include source tree scans in the traces produced by ~--trace-file~ (#7937,
  @rgrinberg)

- Add ~--all~ option to ~dune rpc status~ to show all Dune RPC servers running.
  (#8011, fix #7902, @Alizter)

- Add additional metadata to the traces provided by ~--trace-file~ whenever
  ~--trace-extended~ is passed (#7778, @rleshchinskiy)

- ~$ dune describe~ is now a command group, so arguments to subcommands must be
  passed after subcommand itself. (#7919, @Alizter)

- Add ~dune show~ command group which is an alias of ~dune describe~. (#7946,
  @Alizter)

- Add ~dune show env~ command and make ~dune printenv~ an alias of it. (#7985,
  @Alizter)

- Add commands ~dune show targets~ and ~dune show aliases~ that display all the
  available targets and aliases in a given directory respectively. (#7770,
  grants #265, @Alizter)

- Extensions used in ~(dialect)~ can contain periods (e.g., ~cppo.ml~). (#7782,
  fixes #7777, @nojb)

- The ~interface~ and ~implementation~ fields of a ~(dialect)~ are now optional
  (#7757, @gpetiot)

- Add ~(build_if)~ to the ~(test)~ stanza. When it evaluates to false, the
  executable is not built. (#7899, fixes #6938, @emillon)

- Allow ~(include_subdirs qualified)~ to be used when libraries define a
  ~(modules ...)~ field (#7797, fixes #7597, @anmonteiro)

- Allow multiple globs in library's ~(stdlib (internal_modules ..))~
  (@anmonteiro, #7878)

*** Changed

- Do not re-run OCaml syntax files on every iteration of the watch mode. This
  is too memory consuming. (#7894, fix #6900, @rgrinberg)

- Attach melange rules to the default alias (#7926, @haochenx)

- Compute digests and manage sandboxes in background threads (#7947,
  @rgrinberg)

*** Fixed

- Validate file extension for ~$ dune ocaml top-module~. (#8005, fixes #8004,
  @3Rafal)

- Cinaps: The promotion rules for cinaps would only offer one file at a time no
  matter how many promotions were available. Now we offer all the promotions at
  once (#7901, @rgrinberg)

- Add necessary parentheses in generated opam constraints (#7682, fixes #3431,
  @Lucccyo)

*** Removed

- Remove some compatibility code for old version of dune that generated
  ~.merlin~ files. Now dune will never remove ~.merlin~ files automatically
  (#7562)

- In opam constraints, reject ~(and)~ and ~(or)~ with no arguments at parse
  time (#7730, @emillon)
