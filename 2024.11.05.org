* GPTar 1.0.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-gptar-1-0-0/15527/1

** Reynir Björnsson announced


I am pleased to announce [[https://github.com/reynir/gptar][GPTar]] 1.0.0!

GPTar is a small library to create a /tartition table/, that is, a tar archive that also contains a valid GUID partition table (GPT).

It exploits the fact that the important areas of a protective MBR in GPT and a tar header are mostly disjoint. The tar header fits almost exactly in the boot strap code of a master boot record (MBR) with the last 54 bytes of the tar header overlapping with the partition table of the (protective) MBR. Thakfully, those are the 54 last bytes of the 155 byte long NUL terminated "filename prefix" of the tar header. So as long as we put a NUL byte before the partition table tar will happily ignore the partition table data.

To further hide the actual GPT header & partition table from tar utilities the first tar header uses the GNU volume header extension with the GPT header & partition table as the "file contents". This makes GNU tar list the volume header but when extracting files the volume header is skipped. For *released* versions of bsdtar this unfortunately results in a "bad archive" error - however, the as-yet unreleased libarchive/bsdtar fixes this "bug" and allows for this abuse of volume headers (see the "update" blog post).

For more in depth details you may be interested in reading the following two blog articles:

- https://blog.robur.coop/articles/gptar-update.html

*** Why!?

Great question. At [[https://robur.coop/][Robur]] we developed an [[https://git.robur.coop/robur/opam-mirror/][opam-mirror]] unikernel that acts as an opam repository and package source archive cache similar to https://opam.ocaml.org/. There we use tar as a filesystem for the package source archive cache. Later, we started using the end of the block device to cache data such as git state and computed package source archive checksums.

The neat feature is we could use regular old bsdtar or GNU tar in the host system to inspect the tar filesystem data. The downside was the lack of a partition table using offsets provided by boot arguments for where to find the cached data. With GPTar we can have both! Inspect the tar filesystem data while being more robust with a partition table.

Also, it was very fun to develop.
      



* opam 2.3.0~rc1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-3-0-rc1/15533/1

** Kate announced


We're happy to announce the first and hopefully only release candidate of opam 2.3.0.

This version does not have any significant change compared to the previous 2.3.0~beta2 release
and we hope the final release to also have no significant change.
Regardless, we invite users to test this version to make sure there isn't any regressions.

Unless a regression is spotted or another problem arises, we hope to have the final release of 2.3.0 out on the 12th of November.

*** Try it!

The upgrade instructions are pretty much the same:

For Unix systems
#+begin_example
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.3.0~rc1"
#+end_example

or from PowerShell for Windows systems
#+begin_example
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) } -Version 2.3.0~rc1"
#+end_example

Please report any issues to [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues][the bug-tracker]].

* First beta release for OCaml 5.3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/first-beta-release-for-ocaml-5-3-0/15551/1

** octachron announced


One month and half after the release of the first alpha for OCaml 5.3.0, the release of OCaml 5.3.0 is drawing near.

The internal API of the compiler libraries has been frozen, and most core developer tools support (or will support soon) the new version of the compiler.

We have thus released a first beta version of OCaml 5.3.0 to help you update your software and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation instructions). More information about the whole release process is now available in the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/introduction.md][compiler repository]].

Compared to the first alpha release, this beta contains a few runtime or typechecker fixes, a handful of fixes for the runtime event library and other miscellaneous fixes.

Exceptionally, this beta release also introduces a new flag `-keywords` for the compiler. This backward compatibility flag aims to help compiling old code that are using `effect` as a normal identifier, now that `effect` is a keyword in the new effect handler syntax.

The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/26596][opam readiness for 5.3.0 meta-issue]].

The full release is expected in the end of November or beginning of December, see the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/release-info/calendar.md][new prospective calendar]] for more information.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][OCaml's issue tracker]].

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the updated change log for OCaml 5.3.0 is available [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.3/Changes][on GitHub]] and a short list of the changes since the last alpha is available below.

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1 and later:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create 5.3.0~beta1
#+end_example

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.3.0-beta1.tar.gz][GitHub]]
- [[https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.3/ocaml-5.3.0~beta1.tar.gz][OCaml archives at Inria]]

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta1+options <option_list>
#+end_example

where ~option_list~ is a space separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

#+begin_example
opam
#+end_example
 switch create 5.3.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array

All available options can be listed with ~opam search ocaml-option~.
