HOL Light released to OPAM

───────────────────────

  The HOL Light interactive theorem prover written by John Harrison is
  released to OPAM as a package. Its first new version available on OPAM
  is 3.0.  It now provides `hol.sh' which is a script that will launch
  an OCaml REPL that enables interactive theorem proving. Combined with
  a VSCode plugin for HOL Light, this gives a nice theorem proving
  experience..! For more details, please visit:

────────────────────────────────────────────

  So after a few hours of work, we've successfully ported the OMicroB
  Virtual Machine for OCaml to the Numworks calculator :tada: ! See
  [this part of our discussion on GitHub], if anyone is curious.

  But we're far away from being done! Indeed, I want to be able to
  interpret *on the calculator* some OCaml line of code / or entire
  file.  I know it's probably going to be hard, if not entirely
  impossible, but hey we've at least progressed a bit in this direction!
  Thanks @borisd again for the suggestion!  @Vertmo is helping me on
  this issue, thanks to him.

opam 2.3.0~beta2
════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-3-0-beta2/15496/1>


Kate announced
──────────────

  We're happy to announce the second beta release of opam 2.3.0.

  As we're closing on the final release of opam 2.3.0, we'd be happy for
  people to test this beta and report any regression.


What's new?
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This release consists mostly in one regression fix compared to
  2.3.0~beta1:

  • Fix a regression in the detection of the current terminal size that
    leads to opam output that tries to fit itself into 80 columns
    regardless of the current terminal size ([#6243])

  A couple of other improvements were made.  :open_book: You can read
  our [blog post] for more information, and for even more details you
  can take a look at the [release note] or the [changelog].

[changelog] <https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/2.3.0-beta2/CHANGES>


Try it!
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The upgrade instructions are pretty much the same:

  For Unix systems
  ┌────
  │ bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.3.0~beta2"
  └────
  or from PowerShell for Windows systems
  ┌────
  │ Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) } -Version 2.3.0~beta2"
  └────

  Please report any issues to [the bug-tracker].

Shell Completions in Dune Developer Preview
═══════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/shell-completions-in-dune-developer-preview/15522/1>


Steve Sherratt announced
────────────────────────

  Support for dune shell completions for bash and zsh has just landed in
  the [Dune Developer Preview]!

  Running the [installer] adds a snippet to your shell config
  (e.g. `/.bashrc) that installs a completion handler for ~dune'. The
  completion script was taken from [here], and that page has some
  information about how the script was generated. Once it's installed
  the completions will work any time `dune' is typed at the start of a
  command, so you can still use the completions when running a version
  of Dune installed with Opam or your system package manager after
  installing the Dune Developer Preview.

  Currently only command completions are supported. So you can run:
  ┌────
  │ $ dune c<TAB>
  │ cache  clean  coq
  └────

  …or:
  ┌────
  │ $ dune build -<TAB>
  │ --action-stderr-on-success
  │ --action-stdout-on-success
  │ --always-show-command-line
  │ --auto-promote
  │ --build-dir
  │ --build-info
  │ --cache
  │ ...
  └────

  But if you run `dune build <TAB>' then it will still suggest local
  files rather than build targets.


[Dune Developer Preview] <https://preview.dune.build/>

[installer] <https://preview.dune.build/#download>

[here] <https://github.com/gridbugs/dune-completion-scripts>

Try it out!
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Getting started is easy:

  ┌────
  │ $ curl -fsSL https://get.dune.build/install | sh
  │ $ source ~/.bashrc  # or: ~source ~/.zshrc~ or just restart your shell
  │ $ dune <TAB>
  │ build
  │ cache
  │ clean
  │ coq
  │ describe
  │ diagnostics
  │ exec
  │ ...
  └────
