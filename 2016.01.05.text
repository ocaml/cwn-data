The relevant issues are, I think:
<https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2098>

And a PR that solve some remaining problems with virtual packages:
<https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/2257>

However I need to rewrite it in order to have something less hackish.
      
** François Beranger then said:

OK, thanks for the info, so here is a recipe that worked for me:

wget <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/archive/master.tar.gz>
tar xzf master.tar.gz
cd opam-repository-master
opam-admin make --resolve PKG
# here I needed to remove
# ocamlbuild from the depends field in the opam file of several packages
# so that the solver finally succeed, so opam-admin-make probably has
# a bug
opam repo add offline $PWD
opam repo remove default # then I have only one opam repository setup
# here I turned off my network card
opam update
opam install PKG # worked using tarballs from the local-disk only

** Gabriel Scherer compiled this list:

Here is a sneak peek at some potential future features of the Ocaml
compiler, discussed by their implementers in these Github Pull Requests.
