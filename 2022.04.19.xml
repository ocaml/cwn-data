In order to make some decisions relating to the maintenance of Lwt, I'd like to know a little bit more about how the
library is used in the wild. Do not hesitate to respond to the poll and/or as a message in this thread, or even to
contact me via other means in case discuss is not your jam.

I wrote a [blog post](https://www.tenderisthebyte.com/blog/2022/04/12/ocaml-python-bindgen/) providing an
introduction to ~pyml_bindgen~.  It gives an intro in a slightly different style as compared to the
[docs](https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_python_bindgen/) and the
[examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples), and includes some of the latest
features I've been working on.

      <cwn_what>
Cautionary note for anyone reading this in the future: dynamic imports are asynchronous, and initializing the jsoo
runtime takes some milliseconds, so that if you just do:
#+begin_src js
import("ocaml/export.bc.js");
var x = mylib.myfunction();
#+end_src
the second line will fail as ~mylib~ is not defined yet (at least this is what I think is happening). You need to
guarantee the module is done initializing in some way or other.
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Kim Nguyễn then said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
~import~ should return a promise of the loaded module. So you can just ~await~ for it (if your current context allows
you to write ~await~) or just :
#+begin_src js
 import("ocaml/export.bc.js").then ((_) => {

 mylib.myfunction();

});
#+end_src

      <cwn_who>Rudi Grinberg announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
On behalf of the ocamllsp team, I'm excited to announce the availability of version 1.11.0. This release is an
important milestone for the project because it introduces integration with our favorite build system. When you run
dune in watch mode, you will now be able to see build errors in the diagnostics panel of your editor. It's all rather
experimental for now, so your feedback and bug reports are appreciated.

As usual, the full change log is below.

Happy hacking.

*1.11.0*

*** Features

- Add support for dune in watch mode. The lsp server will now display build
  errors in the diagnostics and offer promotion code actions.

- Re-introduce ocamlformat-rpc (#599, fixes #495)

*** Fixes

- Fix workspace symbols that could have a wrong path in some cases
  ([#675](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/pull/671))

      <cwn_who>Roberto Blanco announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Dear all, Ricardo Rodríguez and I are organizing an introductory OCaml course as part of the annual summer school of
the University of Zaragoza in Spain. (This is the oldest summer university in the country, nearing its centennial
anniversary!). The country's computing programs are quite excellent, although we have found them to generally not pay
serious attention to modern functional programming. Our goal is to use OCaml to begin to address this dearth.

In addition to the regular academic program we are planning a satellite event open to the general public. This is
meant to introduce the OCaml ecosystem to a wider audience of students and academics, as well as professionals. As
part of this, we would like to hold a round table discussion of industrial OCaml users to demonstrate the width and
depth of practical uses of the language. There will be time for participants to present their work in more detail, if
they wish to do so.

If you may be interested in participating or have any questions, feel free to write to me here or send email to
either of us. The course is currently in its planning stages; it is scheduled to take place in early to mid July, in
all likelihood in the city of Zaragoza and in hybrid format. The OCaml Software Foundation is backing the initiative
and we thank them for their generous support.

Updated information about the course will be available on its website:

On behalf of the dune team, I'm pleased to announce version 3.1.0. This release contains some small, but interesting
features, and some important quality of life bug fixes. I encourage everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

Happy Hacking.

*3.1.0 (15/04/2022)*

- Add ~sourcehut~ as an option for defining project sources in dune-project
  files. For example, ~(source (sourcehut user/repo))~. (#5564, @rgrinberg)

- Add ~dune coq top~ command for running a Coq toplevel (#5457, @rlepigre)

- Fix dune exec dumping database in wrong directory (#5544, @bobot)

- Always output absolute paths for locations in RPC reported diagnostics
  (#5539, @rgrinberg)

- Add ~(deps &lt;deps&gt;)~ in ctype field (#5346, @bobot)

- Add ~(include &lt;file&gt;)~ constructor to dependency specifications. This can be
  used to introduce dynamic dependencies (#5442, @anmonteiro)

- Ensure that ~dune describe~ computes a transitively closed set of
  libraries (#5395, @esope)

- Add direct dependencies to $ dune describe output (#5412, @esope)

- Show auto-detected concurrency on Windows too (#5502, @MisterDA)

- Fix operations that remove folders with absolute path. This happens when
  using esy (#5507, @EduardoRFS)

- Dune will not fail if some directories are non-empty when uninstalling.
  (#5543, fixes #5542, @nojb)

- ~coqdep~ now depends only on the filesystem layout of the .v files,
  and not on their contents (#5547, helps with #5100, @ejgallego)

- The mdx stanza 0.2 can now be used with ~(implicit_transitive_deps false)~
  (#5558, fixes #5499, @emillon)

- Fix missing parenthesis in printing of corresponding terminal command for
  ~(with-outputs-to )~ (#5551, fixes #5546, @Alizter)
