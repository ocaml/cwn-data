I am happy to announce a new release of ledit : 2.00.

Ledit is a line editor allowing to run interactive commands (e.g. the
OCaml toplevel) with the ability to move the cursor, delete parts, see
balanced parentheses, move inside the history, things like that, like
in emacs or in the shell.

Main change:
 It is now possible to have one's own keys bindings in the file ".leditrc"
 of one's home directory (or defined by the environment variable LEDITRC).
 See manual page.
   Note: this file can be modified while ledit is running, the changes are
 immediately taken into account.

for ocamlnet novices I document here what you need to access web
sites that use cookies for authentication (eg, wikis or mailman).
With this you can let ocaml perform your mailing-list
administrator tasks or write a wiki bot.

Cookie authentication works as follows: When you first visit the
site you have to authenticate with username and password that are
usually sent (in cleartext) in a post request to the server. The
server responses with a cookie that will be used for
authentication in all following requests. 

Because you have to retrieve and set cookies in the headers you
cannot use the Http_client.Convenience module. You really have to
dive into ocamlnet.

Here comes the solution:

Netstring extension:

- You need get_set_cookie, which will retrieve cookies from a
 response header but which is not in ocamlnets netstring library
 currently. Download from [1] or with two additional helper
 functions from [2].


Prerequisites:

- Create a pipeline with "new Http_client.pipeline", it will
 process all http requests. (Don't ask me about timeouts and
 retries, the defaults work fine for me.)


Get going (download some page without authentication):

- Create a get call "new Http_client.get url"

- Process the call: Add it to the pipeline (method #add) and run
 the pipeline (#run). By this the call will be changed and
 contain the response. 

- Check the response status (#response_status), which should
 usually be `OK and get the page (#response_body#value).

- In case of error convert the status into something readable
 with Nethttp.string_of_http_status or consult the response
 status message (#response_status_text).


Login:

- Create post call with 
 "new Http_client.post url parameters", the parameters are a
 string * string list, eq 
   [("wpName", "mywikiname");
    ("wpPassword", "mywikipasswd");
    ("wpLoginattempt", "Log in")]
 for a MediaWiki.

 [In order to get the parameters save the login page, change the
 method of the right from into "GET", load the page into a
 browser, press the login button and parse the new URL you get.]

- Process the call.

- Check the status (#response_status): For MediaWiki it should be
 `Found, for mailman and others `Ok (don't ask me why).

- Retrieve the response header (#response_header) and extract the
 cookies with get_set_cookies from [2].


Make an authenticated request:

- Create your call "new get url" for getting a page or 
 "new post url" for performing an action.

- Access the request header (#request_header `Base) and add your
 cookies there (set_cookies from [2]). This is all done via
 side-effects, no need to write the modified header back into
 the call.

- Process the call and get the response.


Compilation:

- with findlib and -package netclient -linkpkg:

 ocamlfind {ocamlc,ocamlopt} -package netclient -linkpkg your files ...


Acknowledgements:

- Praise Gerd Stolpmann for ocamlnet and findlib.



That's it. For an example go to [3], which contains a MediaWiki
bot that updates structural information in the Mozilla wiki [4].
The needed utility functions are in wiki_http: wiki_login to
login, download to download a web page, get_page to get a wiki page
and write_wiki_page to write one.

A 'Palindromic Quine' code is now wanted by a shortest-code contest at:

<a href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?Palindromic+Quine">http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?Palindromic+Quine</a>

The code should be a Quine, which prints its own code without reading
its source file. Additionally, the code should be palindromic, which
reads the same forward as it does backward. Shorter code is better.
Lots of programming languages are available including OCaml, of course.

Please submit your palindromic Quine to the above contest if you find it.
The deadline is Thursday, 7 February 2008, 16:46:39, GMT.
All submitted programs will be revealed after the deadline.
At present the shortest code in OCaml has 205 bytes.
