Hello

Here is the latest OCaml Weekly News, for the week of April 27 to May 04, 2021.

#+TOC: headlines 1


* Ocaml-solidity, a new OCaml library for Solidity

:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocaml-solidity-a-new-ocaml-library-for-solidity/7746/2

** Continuing the thread from last week, Fabrice Le Fessant announced


I should add that the project is now available in the opam-repository, see
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/solidity-parser/][solidity-parser]] and
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/solidity-typechecker/][solidity-typechecker]].
      



* Release of ocaml-pandoc 0.1.0

** Samuel Mimram announced


I have just released [[https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-pandoc][ocaml-pandoc]], a native OCaml library to write filters
for [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]], which is a markdown-to-anything converter. It has allowed me to write some simple
filters I needed (such as for including code snippets, which is not supported natively).

The support is not complete yet however, I might add more if needed (and pull-requests are of course accepted
:slight_smile:).

      



* Stdlib vs Containers vs Batteries vs Base : Core functions comparison

** Jp R announced


You want to compare the main core functions found in the OCaml Stdlib (v4.12.0), Containers (v3.3), Batteries
(v3.3.0) and Base (v0.14.1) libraries ?

Check it out !

Someone reading this might be also interested in my (less formal) comparison between OCaml Stdlib and Base:

[[https://comby.dev/][Comby]] may also be of interest, it's a similar project also written in OCaml.

On behalf of the ocaml-lsp team, I'd like to announce version 1.6.0 of ocaml-lsp-server. The highlight of this
release is the updated version of merlin which brings lots of new bug fixes.

**** Fixes

- Fix interface/implementation switching on Windows (#427)
