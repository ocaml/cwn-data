2) notes on camlp4 3.10
3) Two ocaml projects are selected (Re: OCaml Project in Google Summer of Code)
4) Other Digests than md5?
5) What are people using for linear algebra?

========================================================================
1) CamlPDF v0.1
Archive: <http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_frm/thread/8e98cc23ccae6e27/925416241d5fda94#925416241d5fda94>

** John Whitington announced:

CamlPDF is a library for reading, writing and manipulating PDF files 
and data. 

This is a request-for-comment release, under a BSD-style licence: 

<http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/camlpdf.html> 

Those not interested in PDF may, however, be interested in the 
literate program, which shows what can be done with ocamlweb: 

<http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/camlpdf.pdf> 

CamlPDF has already shipped as part of a popular shrink-wrapped 
desktop product. However, since this large codebase aims to provide 
a more complete PDF library than was required for that product, 
feedback would be much appreciated. Please see the Request for 
Comment on page (iii) of the literate program.

2) notes on camlp4 3.10
Archive: <http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_frm/thread/742c89b5101b070d/2251aa465915390c#2251aa465915390c>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Jeff Henrikson announced:

I stuffed all the my recent notes on camlp4 3.10 onto ocaml-tutorial.org. 

<http://ocaml-tutorial.org/camlp4_3.10> 

If you too are doing experiments with the new camlp4, please write down 
the things that you find.  Even if a new camlp4 experiment is 
contributed only 80% correctly I feel that it's better than it having no 
documentation.  The errors will correct with time. 

I am totally open to taking it out of the "tutorial" list on the home 
page, since it's really not a tutorial.  Someone with history editing on 
the site should decide how it should be listed ...

3) Two ocaml projects are selected (Re: OCaml Project in Google Summer of Code)
Archive: <http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_frm/thread/2a4317d98c531d07/f6a847b66f2da1a5#f6a847b66f2da1a5>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yoriyuki Yamagata announced:

The Free Software Initiative of Japan select two OCaml projects for 
Google Summer of Code. 
<http://code.google.com/soc/fsijp/about.html> 

The projects are 

STMlib: Multi-backend STM library for OCaml 
by Zheng Li 

Improve Eclipse plugin of OCaml 
by Soutaro Matsumoto. 

Both are mentored by me.

4) Other Digests than md5?

** Oliver Bandel asked and Eric Cooper answered:

Not in the standard library, but with the same interface as Digest: 
    <http://tab.snarc.org/projects/ocaml_sha/> 
In Debian, just "apt-get install libsha-ocaml-dev".
			
========================================================================
5) What are people using for linear algebra?

ocamlgsl, my bindings for the GSL library has some linear algebra too 
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/> 
mind that GSL's license is GPL, not LGPL.

Thanks Jon, I have it compiling. 
You might hwoever want to fix the lacaml link on your page. The link 
you have is broken but this one (from Christophe) works:

6) LSD mount utilities

------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Markus announced:

Release 1.4 of LSD mount utilities (minor enhancements) 

   A new version (1.4) of the LSD mount utilities has been released 
   (download here: <http://software.m-e-leypold.de/lsd-mount-utilities>). 

   This release doesn't add new functionality. Instead parts of the 
   code have been reorganized in (probably more reliable) reusable 
   components. 

   As a side effect 

     - The installation footprint has been reduced by factor ~2.3 
       (formerly separate programs have been gathered into a single 
       one and switch on the name under which the program is 
       installed). 

     - The tool verbosity is greatly reduced (since we now suppress 
       standard error for most of the probing with external tools). To 
       get a partial trace of the things happening internally 
       (e.g. which external programs are invoked) you can now set the 
       environment variable lsd_lama_trace=verbose. 

   A more detailed description of the utilities can be found at 
   <http://www.etc-network.de/blog/mel/projects/lsd-mount-utilities/about.html>. 

   Please read the complete README (and specfically the disclaimer) 
   before installing or using the software).

7) Programming language development job offer
Archive: <http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_frm/thread/a2dd7b2ac2ef6f25/40b6c5bbaf68c3c3#40b6c5bbaf68c3c3>

** Massimiliano Brocchini announced:

Net7 is looking for a researcher to participate in the WebSiCoLa project. 
WebSiCoLa is a Marie-Curie Transfer of Knowledge international project. 
The objective of the project is to develop a functional programming 
language conceived specifically for programming web applications and web 
services. The language will be compiled to OCaml. 

You will have the opportunity to work in a stimulating team in the 
beautiful city of Pisa in Italy for two years and in France (for CNRS or 
University of Paris XIII) for at least one year. 

Do you fulfill the following requirements? 

- have a Ph.D. in computer science 
- your native country is one of the European Union Member States **except 
Italy** or one of the following: Croatia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Iceland, 
Israel, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland. 
- your native country is not in the above list but you worked four of 
the last five years in one of the above list of countries. 
- ability to speak and write in English

Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'<1':1
zM
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

Old cwn
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to miss a CWN, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@polytechnique.org) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/>) or the RSS feed of the
archives (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/cwn.rss>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, you may subscribe online at
