&gt; "The threads library is implemented by time-sharing on a single
&gt; processor. It will not take advantage of multi-processor machines.
&gt; Using this library will therefore never make programs run faster.
&gt; However, many programs are easier to write when structured as several
&gt; communicating processes."
&gt;
&gt; However, the documentation states that the native threads library is
&gt; implemented using the system's native threading. (POSIX threads, in my
&gt; case)
&gt;
&gt; Is the quote above still consistent with the native threads implementation?

Basically, yes.
With posix threads (or windows threads), every caml thread is mapped
to a posix thread, but there is a global mutex which any caml thread
must obtain before running. This makes sure for instance that memory
allocation and GC work properly.
So no more than one caml thread may run simultaneously, and you don't
gain from multiple CPUs.

However, contrary to vmthreads, this restriction only applies while
executing caml code. If you call some C function, you may choose to
first release the global lock (caml_enter_blocking_section), letting
other caml threads work while you are on the C side. Don't forget to
call lock again (caml_leave_blocking_section) when returning, or you
will crash very soon.

GODI, the O'Caml source-based distribution, is now available for O'Caml
3.08. GODI automatically downloads, builds, and installs the core O'Caml
system together with a growing number of libraries and other add-on
software. It runs on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Cygwin, HP-UX,
MacOS X.

The previous O'Caml version, 3.07, is still supported, but it is
expected that the software packages are not as frequently updated as for
the new version, 3.08.

If you are new to GODI, read more here:
<a href="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi/">http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi/</a>

This page explains GODI and how to install it from scratch. Note that
you should use the newest GODI bootstrap tarball
(<a href="http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20040717.tar.gz">http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20040717.tar.gz</a>).

If have already installed GODI for O'Caml 3.07, it is possible to
upgrade it to 3.08:

- Save the packages in &lt;prefix&gt;/build/packages/All. You can
  recover your old installation with them (by godi_add'ing them),
  in the case something fails.
- Edit &lt;prefix&gt;/etc/godi.conf, and set GODI_SECTION=3.08
- Start godi_console, select "Update the list of available packages"
- After that, go to the menu "Select source packages", and select
  _only_ godi-core-mk for rebuild (letter "b" in the package view).
- Perform this single build ("s"tart installation)
- After that, go back to "Select source packages", and select
  godi-ocaml and godi-ocaml-src for build. Most packages are
  dependent on these, so many further packages will also be rebuilt.
- Perform this mass build ("s"tart installation)

Important note of users of Linux kernel 2.6: Sorry, you cannot upgrade.
Please bootstrap again. The reason is a user-visible change of the
"readdir" system call.

I hadn't any problems upgrading GODI-3.07 to GODI-3.08 without
bootstrapping (Fedora Core 2, linux-2.6.7).

&gt; I've defined a set of new operetors, for instance:
&gt;
&gt; let ( /+/ ) = add_num   (where add_num is a function that added two sometype
&gt;                       elements.)
&gt;
&gt; but I don't know if I can set associativity precedence for this operator,
&gt; writing: el1 ( /+/ ) el2 ( /+/ ) el3 without parenthesis, what happens?

The easiest way to control associativity and precedence seems to be to
write a Camlp4 extension.  For example here is a Camlp4 extension I
wrote to create some left-associative ('LEFTA') ops:

open Pcaml

EXTEND
   expr: AFTER "apply"
   [ LEFTA
       [ e1 = expr; "map_with"; e2 = expr -&gt;
           &lt;:expr&lt; List.map $e2$ $e1$ &gt;&gt;
       | e1 = expr; "iter_with"; e2 = expr -&gt;
           &lt;:expr&lt; List.iter $e2$ $e1$ &gt;&gt;
       | e1 = expr; "filter_with"; e2 = expr -&gt;
           &lt;:expr&lt; List.filter $e2$ $e1$ &gt;&gt;
       | e1 = expr; "concat_with"; e2 = expr -&gt;
           &lt;:expr&lt; List.concat (List.map $e2$ $e1$) &gt;&gt;
       | e1 = expr; "apply_with"; e2 = expr -&gt;
           &lt;:expr&lt; $e2$ $e1$ &gt;&gt;
       ]
   ];
END
    </pre><i>Jean-Baptiste Rouquier also anwered the OP:</i><br /><pre>
The manual says that here you have left associativity. See
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual015.html">http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual015.html</a>

# let ( /+/ ) a b =
 Printf.printf "a=%i, b=%i\n%!" a b;
 a + b;;
   val ( /+/ ) : int -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let _ = 1 /+/ 2 /+/ 39;;
a=1, b=2
a=3, b=39
- : int = 42
    </pre><i>John Prevost added:</i><br /><pre>
In general, the associativity and precedence of an operator (unless
you go out to camlp4 or something) is based on the operator's first
character.  For example +/ would act like +, */ would act like *, and
so on.  For this reason, you'll often see O'Caml operators defined as
"basic operator followed by some strange symbol."  In your add_num
case, +/ and friends would probably mesh well.  Then you also get the
expected interaction when mixing +/ and */.

I have been looking at the sources of the Bigarray implementation.  I am
chagrined to discover that not only does Bigarray cost a function call
per array element access, but a number of additional piggish things
happen per access.  To C/C++ programmers interested in performance, this
defeats the purpose of using unboxed array elements.  If I wanted to pay
function call overhead per element, for instance when communicating with
OpenGL, I'd simply call functions.

I am wondering if there is some way to present a block of C memory to
OCaml, and then have OCaml use it directly?  If so, I could envision
writing up something I'd call 'Fastarray'.  But I'm interested in any
pitfalls you might see, such as range check requirements.

In other news, I've been trying and trying to announce the next ML
S*attle meeting on Tuesday, July 27th.   E-mail me for details.  These
anti-spam filters are maddening.

If memory serves, Ocaml can optimize the access if the size and type are
known, getting rid of the function call overhead and type specialization.
I don't think it gets rid of the bounds checking, tho- which is good.

Can someone who actually knows what is going on clarify this?

Function calls aren't that expensive.  From comments in other forums:
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=cdjsuj%24cs6%241%40wolfberry.srv.cs.cmu.edu">http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=cdjsuj%24cs6%241%40wolfberry.srv.cs.cmu.edu</a>

may I respectfully suggest that you are prematurely optimizing?  A
function call to a known function takes 1-2 clock cycles.  A cache miss,
on the other hand, can take hundreds of clock cycles:

No. Not always: when the type of the array is completely known to the
compiler at the point the element is accessed, ocamlopt will access
the element directly, without using the generic C function.
