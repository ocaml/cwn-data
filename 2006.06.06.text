Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, for the week of May 30 to June 06, 2006.

1) immutable strings

OK, but let's be pragmatic: what kind of interface and implementation do 
you have in mind?

(and then: isn't it possible to implement in OCaml?)


If anyone is interested:

Before posting I tried a polymorphic (wrt mutability) string type.
It was fun enough, but it doesn't scale very well. I put it there:

Well, as it says: dynamic loading of C stub code is not currently
supported under MacOSX/x86, so you can't do #load "unix.cma" from the
standard toplevel.  Remember, this is not guaranteed to work
everywhere, only on platforms that support DLL loading.

Someone posted a small patch to configure that enables loading of DLL
on MacOSX/x86.  It's not yet in CVS because I'd like to test some
more, and that will have to wait until my new shiny MacBook Pro
arrives.  Feel free to fish the patch from the mailing list archives
and give it a try.

Alternatively, fix the Makefile to compile install.ml to a bytecode
executable and run that.  This would work everywhere.

Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'<1':1
zM
If you know of a better way, please let me know.

Old cwn
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to miss a CWN, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@polytechnique.org) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/>) or the RSS feed of the
archives (<http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/cwn.rss>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, you may subscribe online at
