1) HTTP-server written in ocaml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Jurjen Stellingwerff announced:

In the past few months I have written a web-server in ocaml. This
resulted in a module library and a stand-alone web-server. This server
has an internal scripting language that is basically just html with
extra tags (like &lt;loop&gt; ... &lt;/loop&gt; and &lt;when test="a=3"&gt; ... &lt;/when&gt;)
Yes I know... yet another scripting language.

But there is hope... this server is also usable as a module so if you
want to web enable your own application feel free to grab this
project...

The code should be stable (I have some remaining worries about SSL) and
I hope to get some feedback on it... please send in all your
encouragements, flames, patches and enhancement request.

2) How to find out if a function is tail recursive?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Richard Jones asked:

I was writing the section on tail recursion in the OCaml tutorial, and
was surprised to find out that the range function (below) isn't tail
recursive. Or at least it causes a stack overflow on a
large-but-not-unreasonable input value.

let rec range a b =
  if a &gt; b then []
  else a :: range (a+1) b
  ;;

let list = range 1 1000000;;

Printf.printf "length = %dn" (List.length list);;

Can you tell me why this function isn't tail recursive, and share any
useful tips on how to tell whether a function is or is not tail
recursive?

** Neel Krishnaswami answered:

A function call is a tail call if it is the last thing that the
function does before returning. In this example:

 let rec range a b =
   if a &gt; b then
      []
   else
      a :: range (a+1) b

The two expressions '[]' and 'a :: range (a+1) b' are in tail
position. The recursive call to range is *not* in tail position,
because you need to do the 'a :: &lt;value&gt;' before returning.

You can identify 'tail position' as a purely syntactic criterion, and
then a 'tail call' is any function call in tail position.

With the function definition

  let f x = &lt;expr&gt;

&lt;expr&gt; is an expression in tail position.

If you have an expression &lt;expr&gt; in tail position, then

If &lt;expr&gt; = &lt;f&gt; &lt;x&gt;, then:

  o neither subexpression &lt;f&gt; nor &lt;x&gt; is in tail position,
  o the call '&lt;f&gt; &lt;x&gt;' is in tail position

If &lt;expr&gt; = if &lt;test&gt;
            then &lt;e_1&gt;
            else &lt;e_2&gt;, then:

  o &lt;test&gt; is not in tail position
  o &lt;e_1&gt; and &lt;e_2&gt; are in tail position

If &lt;expr&gt; = match &lt;m&gt; with
            | pat -&gt; &lt;e_1&gt;
            | ...
            | pat -&gt; &lt;e_n&gt;, then:

  o &lt;m&gt; is not in tail position
  o &lt;e_1&gt; ... &lt;e_n&gt; are in tail position.

If &lt;expr&gt; = begin
              &lt;e_1&gt;;
              ...
              &lt;e_n-1&gt;;
              &lt;e_n&gt;
            end, then:

  o &lt;e1&gt; ... &lt;e_n-1&gt; are not in tail position
  o &lt;e_n&gt; is in tail position

If &lt;expr&gt; = try &lt;body&gt; with exn -&gt; &lt;handler&gt;, then:

  o &lt;body&gt; is not in tail position
  o &lt;handler&gt; is in tail position

** Brian Hurt also answered:

A function is tail recursive if it fits both of the following criteria:

1) It returns the value returned by calling itself *unmodified*.  And
modification of the return value means the functions is not tail
recursive.  This is where your example fails- it modifies the return value
br list-prepending a new item to it.  Note that even the simplest
"modifications" defeat tail recursion.  For example, the following code is
*not* tail recursive:

let rec sum x = if x &gt; 1 then x + (sum (x-1)) else x

Trying to calculate sum 80000 overflows the stack.  The general pattern
for how to fix this is to instead accumulate the modifications into a
parameter, generally called 'accu' or 'accum' or similar.  Often times,
the recursion is then hidden in an inner function.  So you might rewrite
the above function like:

let sum x =
    let rec loop i accum =
        if (i &gt; 1) then
            loop (i-1) (i + accum) (* &lt;-- note this line! *)
        else
            i + accum
    in
    loop x 0

So now sum 80000 correctly returns 1052556352.  With lists, we can only
build lists backwards, not forwards.  So the general pattern is to build
the list backwards, then reverse it at the last moment.  So you're example
might be written like:
    let range a b =
        let rec loop i accum =
            if i &gt; b then accum
            else loop (i + 1) (i :: accum)
        in
        List.rev (loop a [])

Note, we can put the list reversal either outside of the loop, or inside
of the loop just before we exit, like:

    let range a b =
        let rec loop i accum =
            if i &gt; b then (List.rev accum)
            else loop (i + 1) (i :: accum)
        in
        loop a []

There's really not any difference between the two.

2) The recursive call is not within a try/with block.

So, let's consider the "classic" problem- reading all the lines of a file
into a list of strings.  The naive solution to this is:

let rec read_file chan =
    try
        let line = input_line chan in
        line :: (read_file chan)
    with
        End_of_file -&gt; []

The line that reads "line :: (read_file chan)" is not tail recursive-
we're modifying our return value (by prepending the current line onto it).
This violates condition #1.  So we apply the normal pattern to it, and get
try #2:

let read_file chan =
    let rec loop accum =
        try
            let line = input_line chan in
            loop (line :: accum)
        with
            End_of_file -&gt; List.rev accum
    in
    loop []

So now we're not modifying the return value.  Instead of prepending the
new list element to the return value, we're prepending it to the
accumulator.  So we're no longer violating condition #1.  But we're still
violating condition #2- the recursion is still within a try/with block.

The try/with block really only needs to surround the input_line call- but
it also governs wether we exit the recursion or not.  So my normal pattern
for solving this is to set a boolean variable as to wether we have data or
not.  So the code now looks like:

let read_file chan =
    let rec loop accum =
        let line, eof =
            try
                (input_line chan), false
            with
                End_of_file -&gt; "", true
        in
        if eof then
            loop (line :: accum); (* &lt;-- note, recursion now outside *)
        else
            List.rev accum
    in
    loop []

Now the recursive call is outside the try/with block.  *And*, as we're not
modifying the return value at all, we're now tail recursive.

I'm probably missing more constraints, but it's pre-caffeine.  I'll look
at this again later.

3) FP's and HyperThreading Processors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** David McClain asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; I have a massive application that performs nonlinear fitting to 170+
&gt; parameters; a phase retrieval problem for discerning the aberrations of an
&gt; optical system. This program is written largely in compiled OCaml closures,
&gt; along with a multithreaded vendor supplied FFT routine (presumably optimized
&gt; for their processor).
&gt; 
&gt; On an old P2 single processor machine at 350 MHz, I am seeing almost 95%+
&gt; CPU utilization. But on a new 3 GHz P4 with HyperThreading enabled (dual
&gt; register banks for fast context switching and minimum cache coherence
&gt; overhead), this same program provides much less than 5% CPU utilization. 

How do you measure "CPU utilization"?  Different tools have different
notions of CPU utilization.  For instance, OS-level tools such as
"top", "ps" or "uptime" treat the time spent by the CPU while stalled
by cache misses and the like as user CPU time, not as idle time.
Only processor-level performance monitor counters can distinguish
between active cycles and stalled cycles.

&gt; The net result is that this program runs only twice as fast on the
&gt; new 3 GHz P4 as it runs on the old 350 MHz P2.

Some operations take more cycles on the P4 than on the PPro/P2/P3,
e.g. shifts, integer multiplication and division.  I saw some programs
run slightly slower on a 2 Ghz P4 than on a 1 Ghz P3.  But that
doesn't suffice to explain the factor of 5 that you observed.

&gt; I suspect, but have yet to prove, that the low utilization is due to a low
&gt; CPU to memory bandwidth and to the failure of the L1 and L2 caches to supply
&gt; needed operations and data to the CPU. This, I would hypothesize, is going
&gt; to be demonstrated by any language that prefers fresh memory allocation for
&gt; results, e.g., OCaml, ML, Lisp, Smalltalk, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; If I am correct, then it implies that our hardware friends are moving
&gt; rapidly in the opposite direction to our advanced software systems. I
&gt; mention this in order to tickle the imaginations of both camps.

This was a concern in the early to mid 90s, when processor speed
increased much more than the performances of the memory subsystems.
(I remember Caml benchmarks on an early Alpha system where the processor
was stalled 9 cycles out of 10.)

But since then the hardware manufacturers have done a very good job at
maintaining a decent balance between the memory subsystem and the ALU.
In particular, out-of-order execution is quite effective at hiding
cache miss latencies.

My general feeling (although I have no proof of that) is that the
memory usage patterns of Caml programs aren't radically different from
those of more mainstream programs.

** Ville-Pertti Keinonen also said:

Does calling from OCaml affect the performance of the FFTs?   

You presumably use your own C wrappers to access the vendor code from
your OCaml code - do you align the stack?

For floating point intensive code, lack of alignment can cause
significant differences in performance.  I remember seeing 40%
differences (worst case) in performance when I ran into this several
years ago, and I don't think the situation has improved with more
recent cpus.

OCaml currently doesn't ensure more than word alignment for stack or
allocations on i386, so you are going to have suboptimal performance
for any floating point code written in OCaml (as well as float arrays
allocated in OCaml but manipulated elsewhere).  However, if you're
calling external code (presumably compiled in an alignment-preserving
way), you should at least try ensuring that the stack is aligned to a
64-bit boundary (or 128-bit boundary if SSE is used for anything) in
case that affects performance.

If you're actually making heavy use of hyperthreading, it may make
memory access patterns less uniform and performance highly
unpredictable.  Have you tried comparing performance with and without
hyperthreading enabled?

Anyway, it sounds like you might be running into several issues.  The
only certain way to find out which are the most significant ones is to
do large amounts of profiling and testing.

4) Type safe affectation ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Christophe Raffalli asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; Using the Obj module you can do affectation of cons cell of a list (or 
&gt; any onther data type), which is usefull for instance to write a tail 
&gt; recursive Map funtion ... (see a previous thread)
&gt; But this is not typesafe !

Like all uses of module Obj, you can make this type-safe via proper
type constraints:

let set_cdr (l: 'a list) (x: 'a list) =
  match l with
    [] -&gt; invalid_arg "set_cdr"
  | _::_ -&gt; Obj.set_field (Obj.repr l) 1 (Obj.repr x)

&gt; Why not allow a typesafe way to mute immutable data (sum, products, 
&gt; immutable records and so on) ?

Because that would make this data mutable :-)  Immutability isn't there
just to annoy the programmer: it's a major improvement for software
reliability and quality.  Proving the correctness of functions that
manipulate lists or trees is feasible if the data is immutable, but
becomes essentially impossible if arbitrary in-place modifications are
allowed anywhere in the program.

Even if you're not interested in proofs of programs, I'm ready to bet
that there aren't 1 programmer in 100 who can write *fully correct*
code that manipulate mutable balanced trees, for instance.  (I think I
can't.)

Also, keep in mind that the compiler can optimize based on
immutability assumptions.  For instance, the OCaml compiler performs
propagation of structured constants and code motion for accesses
inside data structures that are immutable.  You might very well break
something by using the set_cdr function above.

&gt; By the way, another step would be to infer for each function if it mutes 
&gt; its arguments instead of annotating record with "mutable" indication.
&gt; 
&gt; This is better because the same data may be considered as mutable by 
&gt; some functions (for instance when you construct the data) but then be 
&gt; used only by immutable functions and this way the type inference can 
&gt; help you insure that you do not mute the data anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; But this is research topic ?

This sounds reminiscent of effect systems.

** The discussion then moved to "holes". Jacques Garrigue replied to Brian 
   Hurt:

There are safe ways to do that: when you build such a structure with a
hole, first define a mutable type sharing the same representation with
your intended immutable type, and cast to it after you're finished.
Since ocaml doesn't do any fancy representation optimizations, this
will work, and if it changes all C libraries are broken anyway.

For instance, you can write for a list:

type 'a mut_list = {hd: 'a; mutable tl: 'a list}
external inj : 'a mut_list -&gt; 'a list = "%identity"

Limitation: for sum types, this only works for the first parameterized
constructor (the tag has to be 0). For records there is no problem.

Also, you must be very careful about not letting a mut_list value leak
out (respect the linearity), otherwise inferred information such as
variance will be incorrect, and you can break the type system.

By the way, the above limitation is yet one more reason I think it
would be really cool to allow records inside sum-type definitions.

&gt; If there is one thing I'm regretting with ExtLib, is that we've seemed to 
&gt; make using Obj.magic "cool", or at least "common and useful".  Were holes 
&gt; added to the standard Ocaml compiler, I'd be re-rewritting ExtList to take 
&gt; those optimizations *out*.  There's other stuff in ExtLib which is useful 
&gt; even without the new List code- Enum, for example.  So the project will 
&gt; survive regardless.

The problem is that holes at the type level are a difficult feature to
offer: they require linear types in the compiler. As an optimization,
it is a rather high-level one, and maybe not so easy to know when it
will apply.

&gt; Or maybe I'm overstating ExtLib's effect- and there has always been a lot 
&gt; of Obj.magic going around.

I certainly hope this is not the case. Obj.magic is EVIL.
It is only acceptable in this case because we want to optimize some
well-known structure, and we can check the correctness for sure.
At the user level, it is certainly preferable to use a mutable
structure to start with.

&gt; &gt; On a related note, I'd like a way to make an immutable
&gt; &gt; representation of the built in array by not exporting the
&gt; &gt; mutators, *and then* making the type parameter covariant, say a
&gt; &gt; signature like the following  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; module type FUNCTIONAL_ARRAY = 
&gt; &gt;   sig
&gt; &gt;     type (+'a) t
&gt; &gt;     val init : int -&gt; (int -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a t
&gt; &gt;     val get : 'a t -&gt; int -&gt; 'a 
&gt; &gt;     val length : 'a t -&gt; int 
&gt; &gt;     val map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'b t
&gt; &gt;   end
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only safe ways to do this using array are to hide array in a class 
&gt; &gt; definition or a function closure. It seems that I should be able to 
&gt; &gt; just write 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     type 'a t = 'a array
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and have the type system figure out if it's OK. Arrays are efficient,
&gt; &gt; and there are quite a few cases in my coding where they are not
&gt; &gt; mutable.

This one is just a typing problem. Nothing magic here, and it should
actually be possible to infer correctly the variance of an abstract
type, independently of its representation. But this is high-level and
potentially dangerous stuff, so don't hold your breath for this.

&gt; All you have to do in this code is just not allow a mutation to occur in 
&gt; your code.  As I understand things, to everyone outside of the module 'a t 
&gt; is an abstract type- the only way to mutate it is to pass it to a function 
&gt; in the module that mutates it.

Here the problem is variance. Currently ocaml does not allow the
above, because 'a array is not covariant.

** Gregory Morrisett replied:

&gt;The problem is that holes at the type level are a difficult feature to
&gt;offer: they require linear types in the compiler. As an 
&gt;optimization, it is a rather high-level one, and maybe not so 
&gt;easy to know when it will apply.

Perhaps, but it's easy for a compiler to offer support
for "tail-allocation" (i.e., a tail-call except for a
constructor application) which is what you need for
a tail-recursive append or map.  Perry Cheng implemented it in
the TIL compiler in about a week if memory serves and
it was a tremendous improvement in performance without
any magic.

Yasuhiko Minamide wrote a paper on how to model this
well (I think it appeared in ICFP).  The approach used
in our Typed Assembly Language paper is yet another
approach based on a simple subtyping trick with initialization
flags.  It didn't require linear types at all and
instead of implicit subtyping, you could accomplish
the same thing with an explicit (type-safe) up-cast.

So, all in all, it's quite possible to have the compiler
implement this optimization for the common case of
tail-allocation, and if you think it's more generally
applicable, then you could move to something like TAL's
initialization flags (though I would prefer the former
option.)

5) opteron query
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Kevin Lang asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; Is an Opteron backend for ocamlopt in the works?

Sort of.  I did a proof-of-concept x86_64 port of ocamlopt when the
specs were published.  Since then, I've been waiting to get my hands
on actual hardware.

This promises to be a "good" port of ocamlopt: easy to do and
generating code of decent quality.  Nothing like the IA64 port :-)

&gt; BTW, we don't actually have an Opteron box yet, but it is
&gt; quite likely that we will be getting one.

If you (or any other reader of this list) are willing to give me an
account accessible via ssh, I'll do the port.
