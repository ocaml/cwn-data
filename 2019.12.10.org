* Interesting OCaml Articles

** james woodyatt announced


Found on *Lobste.rs*: Mark Karpov writes yet another [[https://markkarpov.com/post/haskell-vs-ocaml.html][Haskell vs. OCaml]] for old time's sake. I found it worth a read and a mention here.

p.s. He spends a bit of time in the intro lamenting the lack of a conventional Unicode string library for OCaml, and I feel that pain acutely, especially since I'm the author of an *unconventional* one, i.e. the [[https://bitbucket.org/jhw/orsetto/src/default/src/ucs/ucs_text.mli][Ucs_text]] module in my [[https://bitbucket.org/jhw/orsetto][Orsetto]] project.
