SoCaml is a binding for the object-oriented 3D scene library Open
Inventor (tm) (<a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/">http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/</a>).

Here's what can be done in SoCaml so far:

o Create an Inventor scene graph from a string.
o Display the scene graph with an examiner viewer.
o Type in commands that are echoed in a heads-up display.
o Run your own event loop, for greater flexibility and compatibility
  with other graphical systems.

SoCaml is available at

  <a href="http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/software/socaml-1.1.tar.gz">http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/software/socaml-1.1.tar.gz</a>

To try it, edit the Makefile to fit your system and then type make.
Some demos are created.  The documentation is sparse, but the demo
sources should be helpful.

Requirements:
  o OCaml 3.07beta2
  o Camlidl
  o g++ 2.95
  o SGI's version of Open Inventor

Caveats:
  So far it has only been tested on an Intel/Debian system, using the
  inventor-dev package.  I haven't yet made it work with Coin
  (www.coin3d.org) because of some linking issues.  No attempt has been
  made to use it with TGS's version of Inventor.  Also, lots of things
  haven't been wrapped yet.

I am pleased to announce the first release of PostgreSQL-OCaml, a very
complete library for accessing the PostgreSQL-database. This library
builds on Alain Frisch's previous interface (postgres-20010808).

The code has been cleaned up, a few not so important additions have been
made, a few functions, methods and types have been renamed (as well as
the library) and may expect or return different types of parameters. The
interface is very well-documented now, and the library can be easily
installed and used with findlib. It should be fairly straightforward to
adapt existing code that uses the old version.

You can download the library here:

  <a href="http://www.oefai.at/~markus/home/ocaml_sources.html#postgresql-ocaml">http://www.oefai.at/~markus/home/ocaml_sources.html#postgresql-ocaml</a>
    </pre><i>Stefano Zacchiroli asked and Alain Frisch answered:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; This sentence doesn't clarify an issue: is this library supposed to
&gt; supersede Alain's bindings or to be a fork?

Markus and I discussed the issue.

I'll continue to maintain my library, but it is very stable (no bug
reported in 3 years), so in practice, it only means that the package will
remain available. However, it is considered deprecated: new users should
better use Markus' revision.  Existing users can continue with my version
if they are happy with it, or switch to the new interface (the transition
should be easy; OTOH it will mainly bring an aesthetic improvement).

For distribution package maintainers, I think the best thing is to keep my
library available and provide Markus' one under another name.
    </pre><i>Richard Jones proposed:</i><br /><pre>
If people think that the mod_caml DBI approach is the right one (and
it may not be, although it certainly Works For Us), then I could spin
this off into a separate package to make it easier to install.

This is dbi.mli:

<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup</a>

This is dbi_postgres.mli, which is the driver we use all the time in
production at Merjis, hence the most stable / developed:

<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi_postgres.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi_postgres.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup</a>

This is the driver for Perl DBDs:

<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi_perl.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/modcaml/modcaml/dbi_perl.mli?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup</a>

The interface is designed to make it quick to access databases, in the
sense that you write the minimum code necessary.  It's not type safe,
in the sense that if you write garbage SQL, it won't be detected until
runtime.  Alex Baretta is, I believe, pursuing an alternative approach
using Camlp4 which is supposed to be type safe.
    </pre><i>Richard Jones added:</i><br /><pre>
Here's a few more examples I've culled from our code.  We're doing
some (I think) neat stuff here, eg. using sth#map and sth#iter
to quickly iterate over the results from queries:

<a href="http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex2.txt">http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex2.txt</a>

.... combined with pre-prepared statements:

<a href="http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex3.txt">http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex3.txt</a>

And we have some neat code that lets you tie a variable to a
particular field in the database, a kind of (primitive) persistence:

<a href="http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex4.txt">http://www.annexia.org/tmp/dbi-ex4.txt</a>

We use this to tie Gtk widgets to database fields, using the
transaction capabilities of the database to implement Save and
Rollback operations in the GUI.
    </pre><i>Gerd Stolpmann answered Richard Jones:</i><br /><pre>
I think we really need this type of interface. I have some experience
with Perl DBI, and although our company did have the need to support
several database systems in the same product, this made things a lot
easier, simply because you don't have to learn a new API when you switch
to a another database system.

So I would it really appreciate if this interface were released as
independent package.

Of course, I have also some technical remarks:

- I don't understand why there are several ways to represent NULL.
  For example, what is the difference between `Null,
  `TimestampOption None, and `Timestamp ts where ts.ts_is_null=true?

- Using host,port,user,password to identify and authenticate a connection
  works in most cases, but is not very wise for the long-term stability
  of the interface. For example, it is already possible to authenticate
  with X509 certificates, which cannot be expressed with this scheme.
  I would suggest to only have two strings, one called "system_id",
  the other called "authenticator". In general, these strings are
  interpreted by the driver, but there are conventions, e.g.
  "host=XXX,port=XXX" for the system_id, and "user=XXX,password=XXX"
  or "user=XXX,x509privatekey=XXX,x509passphrase=XXX" for the authenticator.

- There is no way to pass options to the driver when one uses the Factory.
  I think it would be a good idea to have a string for driver options,
  again in the format "key=value,...".

- There should be method for escaping strings (so one can generate SQL
  statements)

- One exception should be special: That transactions are aborted because
  of conflicts (think of Postgres' MVCC) or deadlocks and should be repeated.
  I think the other possible errors can be subsumed in one Sql_error exception
  as it is currently done.

- There should be a possibility to coerce a generic connection object
  back to the driver's class. This can be done by adding a method
  driver_handle that just raises a driver-specific exception
  returning the handle. This way it is possible to switch to low-level
  code at any time, e.g. for optimizations for certain DBMS.

- Following the coding guidelines for O'Caml, methods with side-effects
  should have a functional type, e.g. finish : unit-&gt;unit instead
  of just finish:unit. This has also the advantage of making it
  simpler to later add optional arguments to methods.

- There was the question how to handle BLOBs. I worked with DBMS where
  TEXT is a BLOB type. I think there should be a BLOB class like

  class type blob = object
    method length : int64
    method get_chunk : pos:int64 -&gt; len:int -&gt; string
    method write_file : string -&gt; unit
  end

  and there should be methods (of the connection) creating such BLOBs:

  method create_blob_from_string : string -&gt; blob
  method create_blob_from_file : string -&gt; blob

  I think this is the minimal BLOB interface we should support. More
  advanced BLOB interfaces can be implemented in the drivers.

I hope we get a really good generic DBMS layer soon.
    </pre><i>Richard Jones then said:</i><br /><pre>
I pretty much agree with all of Gerd's comments.  I'll accelerate the
process of splitting out Dbi from mod_caml so that it can be used and
developed separately.
    </pre><a name="3" /><hr /><h3>Poll for a graph library</h3><i>Jean-Christophe Filliatre said:</i><br /><pre>
Sylvain  Conchon, Julien  Signoles  and myself  have  started a  graph
library for ocaml. Before going further and releasing this library, we
would like to get some  feedback from people currently using graphs in
ocaml applications or willing to  do so. More precisely, we would like
to  know what  kind of  operations on  the graph  structure  and graph
algorithms are commonly used by such users.

Could you please tell us if you  are the author of a graph library not
already mentioned in the ocaml hump?
    </pre><i>He then clarified:</i><br /><pre>

&gt;
&gt; What do you mean by "graph library"?
&gt;
&gt; A library of graph algorithms (highly desirable - right now I am working
&gt; at a problem where efficient generation of planar graphs is THE main
&gt; issue, and I do it in lisp/ocaml), a graph layout library in the sense
&gt; of a re-implementation of graphviz in ocaml (would also be very nice to
&gt; have), or a plotting library in the sense of gnuplot?
&gt;
&gt; I think you should clarify this a bit more on the list...

You're right, I  should have been clearer. We didn't  want to give too
many details  before the first release,  but let's go.  Our library is
currently providing

 1. Several  data  structures for  graphs  (persistent or  imperative,
    directed  or not,  with labeled  edges  or not,  etc.), sharing  a
    common minimal signature (iterators over vertices, edges, etc.)

 2. Several  algorithms  over graphs,  written  as  functors and  thus
    independently of the graph  implementation (it means you can build
    your own data structure for graphs and still re-use the algorithms
    code). Currently we have  the following algorithms coded: Tarjan's
    strongly   connected   components,   Dijkstra's   shortest   path,
    Ford-Fulkerson's maximal flow,  Warshall's transitive closure, DFS
    and BFS traversal, cycle detection.

    We  are  currently  adding   random  graph  generations  based  on
    algorithms   from  Knuth's   Stanford  GraphBase,   including  the
    generation of random planar graphs.  (This at least seems to be in
    connection with what you're doing.)

 3. Utilities, such  as a graphviz output  --- an ascii  output in the
    DOT format  to be precise (So  we are not  re-implementing a graph
    layout library).

Ocaml-MySQL 1.0.3: Bindings for using MySQL from ocaml.
This release hopefully makes it easier to use on systems without dynamic
linking or native-code compilation. See
<a href="http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ocaml-mysql/">http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ocaml-mysql/</a>

Extlib 0.11.2: Lots of stuff to complement the standard and unix libraries.
Same things as the MySQL changes, plus bugfixes and the getrlimit,
setrlimit, and getrusage unix syscalls. See
<a href="http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/extlib/">http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/extlib/</a>

Ethread 1.0.1: Useful stuff for multi-threaded programs: Read/write locks,
barriers, a simple thread-safe message queue that can be tested with select.
Changes: Better support for systems without native-code compiliation (See a
trend here?) <a href="http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ethread/">http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ethread/</a>

Servinfo 1.0.0: A little tool for looking up entries from /etc/services (I
got tired of using grep). <a href="http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/servinfo/">http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/servinfo/</a>
