For those who (like me) have always been perplexed when they try to use ocamldebug, b/c it just doesn't seem to work like gdb or perl's debugger, or any other debugger I've tried, this video was immensely helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGvJk14sfi8&t=724s

Specifically, I learned that at the beginning of the program, to set a breakpoint in the main program file, I need to do something like (for a file "extract_environments.ml", and line 79):
#+begin_example
break @extract_environments 79
#+end_example
That was blocking me FOREVER, b/c holy cow there's a ton of initialization, and I just didn't know how to run thru all that and get to the first meaningful line of my main program.

Now I do.  I can move forward from here with ocamldebug.  Finally!
      



* Zanuda -- OCaml linter experiment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-zanuda-ocaml-linter-experiment/11784/2

** Kakadu announced


I'm using this linter for teaching for two years, and I'm very happy that I implemented it. Student's code is much less annoying to read :slight_smile: 

*** Release 1.1.0

- #22: Add 'reviewer' tool to report lint's a Github review.
- #13: Discourage matching a tuple using 'match' expression with single branch
  #+begin_src ocaml
   match x with (a,b) -> ...
  #+end_src
- #18: Warn about unneeded mutually recursive types
- #23: Implement a trial version of the Fix module for auto-correction of lints.
  It produces a diff that could be applied later. Dune support is  lacking
- Add command line switch '-skip-level-allow <bool>' to enable/disable lints
  with level=Allow. False has higher priority than per-lint command line switch
  (for example, ~-no-string_concat~)
- #28: Warn about too many nested ~if~ expressions.
- #32: Warn about constructor names that hide default constructor names
- #35: Detect manual implementations of List.map/fold functions
- #50: Propose eta reduction when available
- #51: Warn about pattern matching on boolean values
- #53: Warn about ~"%s"~ in formatted strings
- #54: Detection of unused public declarations in  .mli file.
- #56: Simplify lint about missing license. We look for required doc-comments anywhere in the file, not only in the beginning.
- #60: Skip some checks for some source files (configured via '.zanuda' config file).
- #15: Split 'string_concat' lint to check separately patterns 'a^b^c' (level=Allow) and 'List.fold_left (^)' (level=Warn).
      



* QCheck 0.24
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-qcheck-0-24/16198/1

** Jan Midtgaard announced


I'm happy to announce the 0.24 release of ~qcheck~, ~qcheck-core~, ~qcheck-alcotest~, and ~qcheck-ounit~, along with a 0.6 release of ~ppx_deriving_qcheck~ :tada: 

~QCheck~ is a library for randomized property-based testing, inspired by Haskell's seminal QuickCheck library. The 0.24 release contains a range of improvements to the integrated shrinking of ~QCheck2~, initially introduced in the 0.18 release. As a consequence, its shrinking algorithms should act more predictably, reduce faster, and report smaller counterexamples. In essence, the 0.24 release is what we hoped 0.18 would be. The release also adds missing ~result~, ~int32~, and ~int64~ combinators, as well as more documentation.

If you've previously given ~QCheck2~'s integrated shrinking a spin, I encourage you to try it again with the patched 0.24 release. For new users, the 0.24 release is also a good candidate to check out! :smiley:
Please share any problems you encounter on the ~qcheck~ repo: https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck

Full change log:

- [qcheck-alcotest] Add an optional ~speed_level~ parameter to ~to_alcotest~
- Adjust the ~QCheck2.Gen.list~ shrinker to produce minimal counterexamples at size 3 too
- Replace the ~QCheck2~ OCaml 4 ~Random.State.split~ hack with a faster one
- Improve the ~QCheck2.Gen.list~ shrinker heuristic and utilize the improved shrinker in other ~QCheck2~ ~{list,array,bytes,string,function}*~ shrinkers
- Use ~split~ and ~copy~ in ~Random.State~ underlying ~QCheck2~ to avoid non-deterministic shrinking behaviour
- Add missing documentation strings for ~QCheck.{Print,Iter,Shrink,Gen}~ and ~QCheck2.Gen~.
- Add ~result~ combinators to ~QCheck~, ~QCheck.{Gen,Print,Shrink,Observable}~, and ~QCheck2.{Gen,Print,Observable}~.
- Add missing combinators ~QCheck{,2}.Print.int{32,64}~, ~QCheck.Gen.int{32,64}~, ~QCheck{,2}.Observable.int{32,64}~, and deprecate ~QCheck.Gen.{ui32,ui64}~
- Document ~dune~ usage in README

Happy testing! :smiley: :keyboard:
      



* Bogue, the OCaml GUI

** sanette announced


Dear all,

I’m happy to announce a new version of [[https://github.com/sanette/bogue][Bogue]], version 20250224, now availble on ~opam~.

The main novelty is a brand new *File dialog*. It will open a new window (or popup) which will let the user navigate the file system and select one or more files or directories.

This corresponds to the new [[http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.File.html][File]] module.

You might also be interested in the [[http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.File.Monitor.html][Monitor]] submodule, which implements a *file monitoring* API based on ~fswatch~ (if available) or ~Unix.stat~. 

If you are curious, here is a graphical summary of the current functionalities of Bogue's file dialog (I hope that more will be added soon; I'm open to suggestions)

* Opam repository archival - next phase
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-repository-archival-next-phase/16203/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


Dear everyone,

sorry for the silence -- the phase 3 of the opam repository archival (taking the x-maintenance-intent into account) has to be delayed by (tentatively) one month. The reason is that our tooling is not ready - the task, given an opam repository and maintenance-intent on packages, which can be safely archived, is harder than it seems:
- we've to take compiler versions into account
- there may be a package X in version 1 and 2, both supporting OCaml 4.08, but depend on package Y (where X.1 depends on Y >= 1, and X.2 depends on Y >= 2) -- now Y.1 could support OCaml 4.08, and Y.2 only OCaml 4.12 -- so it is not safe to archive X.1 (since on OCaml 4.08 there won't be any X installable). And this may be deeply nested in the dependency chain

It is useful if you mark your packages with ~x-maintenance-intent~ (as mentioned in https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-repository-archive-clarification-of-the-opam-fields).

We'll let you know once we have tooling in place to cope with the task described above (development is happening here: https://github.com/hannesm/maintenance-intent-filter).

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/upcoming-cmdliner-2-0-changes-that-need-your-attention/16211/1

** Daniel Bünzli announced


If you are a user of ~cmdliner~ note that cmdliner 2.0 – in exchange for auto-completion support – will remove the ability to specify command and options names by unambiguous prefixes according to [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/issues/200][this plan of action]]. 

If you are horrified by it please chime in on the issue.

** Sabine Schmaltz announced


Welcome to the thirteenth edition of the OCaml Platform newsletter!

In this September-December 2024 edition, we are excited to bring you the latest on the OCaml Platform, continuing our tradition of highlighting recent developments as seen in [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/platform-newsletter][previous editions]]. To understand the direction we're headed, especially regarding development workflows and user experience improvements, check out our [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap][roadmap]].

*Highlights:*

- *Dune Enables Cache By Default, Adds WebAssembly Support*
  The latest Dune releases mark significant progress in build performance and language support. Version 3.17.0 enables the Dune cache by default for known-safe operations, improving build times for common tasks. The addition of Wasm_of_ocaml support opens new possibilities for OCaml projects targeting the web or other WebAssembly runtimes. In addition, Dune now supports adding Codeberg and GitLab repositories via the ~(source)~ stanza.
- *opam 2.3.0*
  As announced with opam 2.2, opam releases are now time-based with a cadence of 6 months. Opam 2.3 has been released last November. It contains a major breaking change regarding extra-files handling: extra-files are now ignored when they are not present in the opam file. Previously they were silently added. This release adds also some new commands like ~opam list --latest-only~ or ~opam install foo --verbose-on bar~, among other fixes and enhancements.
- *Improved Editor Workflows with OCaml-LSP and Merlin*
  A major milestone for project-wide features has been reached with the release of OCaml 5.3: LSP's renaming feature now [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-merlin-and-ocaml-lsp-support-experimental-project-wide-renaming/16008][_renames symbols in the entire project_]] if the index is built. Additionally,all of the classic merlin-server commands are now available as LSP custom requests: this enabled the addition of [[https://tarides.com/blog/2025-02-28-full-blown-productivity-in-vscode-with-ocaml/][many new features to the Visual Studio Code plugin]]. Finally a brand new Emacs mode, based on LSP and the new custom queries is [[https://melpa.org/#/ocaml-eglot][now available on Melpa]].
- *Performance and Security Enhancements*
  Recent updates across the platform focus on performance and reliability. Dune optimized its handling of .cmxs files, while opam implemented stricter git submodule error checking. OCaml-LSP resolved file descriptor leaks, contributing to a more stable development environment.

*** *Dune*

*Roadmap:* [[https://ocaml.org/docs/platform-roadmap#w4-build-a-project][Develop / (W4) Build a Project]]

[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-17/15770][Dune 3.17 was released]] with significant improvements to package management. Key features include binary distribution support, better error messages for missing packages, and Windows support without requiring OPAM.

The [[https://preview.dune.build][Dune Developer Preview website]] now provides editor setup instructions and package management tutorials.

Dune's package management features [[https://dune.check.ci.dev/][were tested across hundreds of packages]] in the opam repository, and a coverage tool was developed to track build success rates. For local development, Dune added support for building dependencies via ~@pkg-install~, caching for package builds, and automated binary builds of development tools. The system supports both monorepo and polyrepo workflows, with options for installing individual dependencies or complete development environments.

The addition of [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11093][Wasm_of_ocaml support in Dune]] opens new possibilities for OCaml projects targeting the web or other WebAssembly runtimes. 

*Activities:*
- Updated preview website with editor setup instructions at https://preview.dune.build and published binary installer providing prebuilt Dune binaries
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10710][Enable dune cache by default]]
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/11093][Added wasm_of_ocaml support]]
- Added support for [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10904][Codeberg]] and [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10766][GitLab organizations]] in the ~(source)~ stanza
- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10644][Added support for ~-H~ compiler flag]] enabling better semantics for ~(implicit_transitive_deps false)~

Developer tooling received substantial upgrades during the end of last year and the beginning 2025. A major milestone for project-wide features has been reached with the release of OCaml 5.3: LSP's renaming feature now [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-merlin-and-ocaml-lsp-support-experimental-project-wide-renaming/16008][_renames symbols in the entire project_]] if the index is built. Additionally, all of the classic merlin-server commands are now available as LSP custom requests: this enabled the addition of [[https://tarides.com/blog/2025-02-28-full-blown-productivity-in-vscode-with-ocaml/][many new features to the Visual Studio Code plugin]] and the creation of a brand new Emacs mode, based on LSP, [[https://melpa.org/#/ocaml-eglot][now available on Melpa]].

These features bring OCaml editor support closer to modern IDE capabilities, with implementations available across multiple editors.

**** Merlin and OCaml LSP Server

Support for project wide renaming, search-by-type, and ocaml-lsp-server now exposes all Merlin features via LSP custom queries.

  - Support for images with embedded assets
  - Cross-package linking (linking to modules from external libraries)
- *Search Integration*: Sherlodoc, the search functionality, has been merged into the main odoc codebase ([[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1263][#1263]]), ensuring better maintenance and synchronized releases.

*Notable Activity*
- [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-odoc-3-beta-release/16043][Odoc 3 Beta Release]]

**** Mdx upgraded to OCaml 5.3

*Maintained by:* Marek Kubica (@Leonidas-from-XIV, Tarides), Thomas Gazagnaire (@samoht, Tarides)

With OCaml 5.3, some compiler error messages changed, so MDX was updated to use a more expressive tag system to choose which version of the compiler can run which code block. This effort uncovered a bug in the current handling of skipped blocks for ~mli~ files, which was fixed.

*Notable Activity*
  - OCaml 5.3 support ([[https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/457][#457]]), ensuring the tool remains compatible with the latest OCaml releases.
  - Fixed error handling for skipped blocks in ~mli~ files ([[https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/462][#462]])
  - Improved syntax highlighting ([[https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/461][#461]])
  - Added support for multiple version labels ([[https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx/pull/458][#458]]), improving the ability to test code across different OCaml versions.

*** *Package Management*

**** Opam
