I want to invoke Java programs and use their result
from an OCaml program in my research.

I have tried OCaml-Java to realize the integration
and succeeded to execute some example.However,
it cannot invoke objects defined by me, as far as
I read OCaml-Java document. I think it only realize
seamless integration of Java standard library and OCaml.

Is there anyway to use Java Object which defined by me
or to invoke jar file and use the result?

If you know another way to use the result produced by
Java programs, I want to know the way too.

Any help appreciated.
      </pre><i>Xavier Clerc suggested:</i><br /><pre>
You should actually be able to use your own objects as
easily as any other Java object. It just happens that some
SDK classes can be accessed through the OCaml-Java
library.

The major point to consider is the classpath. By default,
the compiler has only access to the SDK classes, but
you can add any directory or jar file thanks to the "-cp"
command-line switch.
      </pre><i>Chan Ngo also suggested and Paul Pelzl said:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; An alternative, if you want to do as follows:
&gt; - Compile Java program to an executable (not jar file)
&gt; - Call this executable and get the return values from it
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So you can think about Unix module in OCaml, you can use the standard I/O
&gt; to realize a communication channel between your OCaml code and the
&gt; executable Java.

If the data to be exchanged is structurally complex, then this technique
becomes difficult; a cross-platform serialization library can be very helpful
for generating appropriate serialization code in multiple languages. As one
example, Cap'n Proto has bindings for both Java and OCaml:

I am also looking for a way to use Java library in OCaml application. My OCaml
application is performance-critical static source code analyzer. I found two
options: X. Clerc's OCaml-Java and X. Leroy's camljava. Which one is more
suitable?

1. OCaml-Java
From my understanding, OCaml-Java[1] compiles OCaml code into byte code and
packs the byte code, interpreter, and Java code into one Java application. It
looks more like embedding OCaml code in Java, not getting some help from
Java. So it does not satisfy my pro-OCaml taste. I am also concerned about
slowdowns due to byte code and interpreter.

2. camljava
I think camljava[2] is more suitable for my purpose. Using camljava, I can
launch JVM and call Java methods via JNI from native OCaml applications.
However, it is a very low-level interface so that I need to implement many
boilerplates by hand (O'Jacaré[3] might reduce some burden?) and beware of
type-safety. Also, it is not maintained for a long time (the latest
version came out before ten years ago).

Do you have any suggestions? Moreover, could anyone share some real-world
stories about OCaml-Java binding?

Seungcheol Jung

I have used camljava in one project. I found
that solution satisfying although it does involve
a lot of boilerplates, indeed. It makes it possible
to use a JAR a bit like a C library. At runtime, it
is sufficient to set the CLASSPATH.

If you are curious, visit <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/softwares/pew/">http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/softwares/pew/</a>
from where you can find the source code, and execution instructions.
(boilerplate code is in file owlapi.ml)

I am interested by solutions to ease the generation of
boilerplates.
      </pre><i>Xavier Clerc also replied:</i><br /><pre>
OCaml-Java actually compiles OCaml code to *Java* bytecode, meaning that no
OCaml interpreter is involved. Of course, the ocamljava-compiled programs are
slower than ocamlopt-compiled ones; however, the factor is heavily dependent
on the kind of computation.

Currently the rule of thumb is that ocamljava-compiled code is roughly 3 times
slower, with numerical code on par and "massively functional code" much slower
(sometimes 10x slower).

Batteries (OCaml Batteries Included) is a community-developed overlay
over the "standard" library distributed with the compiler, that aims
to provide general-purpose data-structures and convenient functions.

The project follows a semantic versioning scheme; the new version is
backward-compatible with the previous releases (2.3.1 was in October
2014). The lowest OCaml version certainly supported is 3.12.1.

The new release is available in OPAM, or as a tarball
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/releases/tag/v2.4.0">https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/releases/tag/v2.4.0</a>
or from the sources

The online API documentation is at:
<a href="http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.io/batteries-included/hdoc2/">http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.io/batteries-included/hdoc2/</a>

This release contains a handful of new functions and bugfixes -- see
the detailed changelog below. Two highlights are the `pop_{min,max}`
in BatSet and `pop_{min,max}_bindings` in BatMap contributed by
François Berenger, and a nasty bug when hashing values close to
min_int spotted by Martin Neuhäußer -- this long-hidden bug was due to
a mistake in the backward-compatibility code for the hashing function
transition between OCaml 3.12 and OCaml 4.00.

With many thanks to the contributors to this new release, including
Guillaume Allais, Aleksey Z. Arens, Nils Becker, François Berenger,

I'm happy to announce the initial release of ocaml-session:

<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-session">https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-session</a>

ocaml-session is an session manager that handles cookie headers and backend
storage for HTTP servers. The library supports CoHTTP and Webmachine; Async
and Lwt; and pluggable backing stores based on a functor interface.

The library ships with an in-memory backend (for development and testing) and
a postgresql-ocaml[0] based backend. One of the goals of the library is to
expand the number of persistent and ephemeral storage systems (filesystem,
memcache, redis, MySQL, etc.) that are available out of the box so that it's
easy to integrate into a user's existing infrastructure. There is already an
issue open to provide a PG'OCaml-based backend[1] if that's more of your cup
of tea in terms of postgresql libraries. Anybody who would like to contribute
that should claim the issue and have at it!

As always, issues and pull requests welcomed.

-Spiros E.

      </pre><i>Török Edwin then said:</i><br /><pre>
How about signed cookies as a storage backend?
Python Flask and Django can use it to store session entirely in the cookies
with an hmac signature and expiration time, so your server can be entirely
stateless.
As long as the amount of data in your session is small, and all you need is
authenticated data (and not secret data) I think its quite an elegant
solution,
and more fitting with a functional style.

Now of course comes the question Cryptokit or nocrypto :)

This is interesting. As far as I can tell, it should be possible to implement
this as a backend without any modifications to module signatures. 

&gt; Now of course comes the question Cryptokit or nocrypto :)

That decision, for better or worse, has already been made by ocaml-session: it
uses nocrypto to generate session keys.

Here is a basic implementation of something similar to itsdangerous I wrote a
few days ago for a project I'm working on, it uses nocrypto:

With a bit of work it could become an opam package.
