** Continuing this thread, Daniel Bünzli asked and KC Sivaramakrishnan replied


#+begin_quote
One thing that I didn’t get from the paper is how exactly  ~ConcurMinor~  breaks the current FFI and the impact it
would have on the existing eco-system, on a scale from “it affect all projects” to “only people doing  *that*
fancy thing” :–) ?
#+end_quote

All the projects that use the C API. The details are here:
https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/C-API-changes

#+begin_quote
At the end of the paper it seems you make the point that  ~ParMinor~  is the solution to go with for the time
being. Does this means you are going to leave behind the work done on  ~ConcurMinor~  or do you intend to continue
to maintain it ?
#+end_quote

We don't intend to maintain it. It is quite a bit of work to maintain and port the changes across two different GCs.
~ParMinor~ GC is now at 4.11 branch point (the default multicore compiler is 4.10 + ParMinor now). The ~ConcMinor~ is
at 4.06.1.

Given that ~ConcMinor~ breaks the C API, the ecosystem would have to be fixed for ~ConcMinor~ to be useful. The code
changes are indeed intricate; the differences are not just in the minor GC, but the compilers internal use of the C
API. It will be quite a bit of work to keep both GCs in the same source distribution.
      

** Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni then said


#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I do not think this is necessarily true.

Here is why I think so, but be warned that this is preliminary as I do not have time to explore this idea further on
my own at the moment.

*** State in Rust

Breaking the C API is a consequence of deciding that all single-threaded shared mutable state must assume they are
also shared between threads. So a new read barrier is used to promote values when read from another thread. But for
data types that were correct up to now, users must also be careful to avoid races from now on... for instance by
avoiding sharing values of such types between domains.

One lesson of Rust is that there are different kinds of mutable state, for different usages, with different means to
achieve thread-safety.

The closest there is to current OCaml's ~mutable~ is the notion of single-threaded multiple-writers mutable state
(_~Cell~_). It is made thread-safe in Rust by statically preventing values containing ~Cell~ from crossing thread
boundaries (by virtue of not having the _~Send~ trait_). The same restriction is used to make some data structures
more efficient by avoiding the cost of synchronisation (cf. the reference-counting pointer ~Rc~ vs. the atomic
reference-counting pointer ~Arc~).

This is not enough by itself, and Rust offers other kinds of state for communicating and sharing values between
threads.

_~UnsafeCell~_ like Ocaml multicore's ~mutable~ (though yours is safe thanks to the work on the memory model): it has
almost no restriction and can be sent across domains, but the user is likewise told to “avoid data races”. It is
rarely used alone, but together with type abstraction it can be used to program safe concurrent data structures.

Lastly, the default notion of state in Rust is linear state, which can be sent freely across threads. Thread-safety
is ensured by restricting aliasing using the ownership and borrowing discipline.

*** A backwards-compatible concurrent collector?

If I had to imagine a backwards-compatible OCaml with static control of interference à la Rust based on ~ConcMinor~,
it would distinguish the three kinds of state (concretely with other keywords in addition to ~mutable~). ~mutable~
would keep its current meaning of single-domain, multiple-writers state and not require a read barrier, and in
particular preserve the API. (I count systhreads as single-threaded for this purpose, since here it means "sharing
the same minor heap".)

Programs could progressively transition to other kinds of state when parallelising the program. Concretely, a data
structure like ~Stack.t~, instead of becoming racy, would keep its current meaning, but users could replace it with a
linear stack or a concurrent stack, two data structures distinct from the first one, when parallelizing their
programs.

So how could this fit with the current plans? It is not entirely clear to me. If people start to rely on parallelism
in an unstructured way (e.g. no clear distinction between different kinds of data types arising from different ways
of ensuring thread-safety) then one will also lose the ability to retrofit ~ConcMinor~ in a backwards-compatible
manner (by losing the information that the current ~mutable~ API is single-threaded). The API breakage of ~ConcMinor~
which might only be virtual right now (if I trust this preliminary, not fully-explored idea) will become real.
(Further difficulties arise with the emulation of the ~Thread~ library with domains, but this could be changed
later.)

But if users are provided in advance with a general direction for a model of control of interference this might
happen differently. And eventually having such a model is desirable in any case, as it helps parallelizing programs
(for instance the Firefox people reported that they had attempted and failed twice to parallelise the CSS engine in
C++ before succeeding with Rust). Furthermore, in an imaginary retrofitting of ~ConcMinor~, one could imagine
enforcing something like the ~Send~ trait at the level of the read barrier until there is a better way (there would
be two kinds of barriers, one of which would raise an exception if a state happened to be incorrectly shared across
domains, and not be required in the FFI).

I find ~ConcMinor~ interesting from a systems programming perspective compared to the stop-the-world collector
because it could (I hope) offer possibilities such as having a low-latency domain communicating with a higher-latency
domain. Moreover the performance cost of the read barrier might be lower in this scheme if it could be removed for
all but the concurrent data structures.
      



* BAP 2.1.0 Release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2

** Ivan Gotovchits announced


The Carnegie Mellon University Binary Analysis Platform ([[https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap][CMU BAP]]) is a suite of utilities and libraries that
enables analysis of programs that are represented as machine code (aka binaries). CMU BAP is written in OCaml and
uses plugin-based architecture to enable extensibility. We also have a domain-specific language, called Primus Lisp,
that we use to write analysis, specify verification conditions, interact with the built-in SMT solver, and model the
semantics of machine instructions and functions.

The 2.1.0 Release is very rich in [[https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap/releases/tag/v2.1.0][new features]] but the most prominent addition is the new [[https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap/pull/1105][symbolic executor]]
mode for the Primus framework. We also significantly updated the Primus framework, integrated it with our new
Knowledge Base, which was introduced in the BAP 2.0 release; we made our interpreter much faster; we added the
systems and components facilities, inspired by Common Lisp; and we implemented a gradual type checker for Primus Lisp
with type inference. We also added an ability to represent machine instructions as intrinsic functions so now it is
possible to express their semantics using Primus Lisp since we added IEEE754 primitives to the Lisp interpreter.

As usual, we upgraded BAP to the newer versions of the Core library and OCaml (we now support OCaml versions from
4.07 to 4.09). We also significantly improved our build times and added an optional omake backend, which we are using
in-house.

From the user perspective, one of the key features of BAP as an analysis platform is that you can run BAP on binaries
that you can't run otherwise, either because they need special hardware or software, or need to interact with the
outside world. In the past couple of months, we have run BAP on various firmware and found numerous zero-day
vulnerabilities, particular, we were able to find critical vulnerabilities in the VxWorks operating system that runs
on, potentially, billions of devices including mission-critical and military appliances.

As always, questions, suggestions, and opinions are very welcome!
      



* Migrating an Async project to Lwt, a short primer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/migrating-an-async-project-to-lwt-a-short-primer/5908/1

** Michael Bacarella announced


Consider this a post where I think aloud about my experience migrating an Async project to Lwt.  I've spent about a
weekend doing such a thing, and if, in the process of talking about it here I can save a few people an hour or two
(or perhaps inspire confidence to take such a project on in the first place) then it will have been worthwhile.

This wouldn't be a complete post if I didn't also mention @dkim's [[https://github.com/dkim/rwo-lwt][translation of Real World OCaml's Async examples
to Lwt]]

This was born out of a previous effort where I [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/best-practices-on-mixing-lwt-and-async/5372][tried to mix Lwt and Async in the same
project]].   This didn't go so well, so I
tried converting the whole thing to Lwt, and it turns out adapting to Lwt if you're an Async person is actually much
easier than I thought it would be.

*** Basics

Both libraries involve promises/futures.  Async calls its promises
~Deferred.t~, whereas in Lwt they're called ~Lwt.t~.

In Async you start your program by saying ~never_returns (Scheduler.go ())~ or ~Command.async_spec~ after you set up
your initial ~Deferred.t~.

In Lwt you say ~Lwt_main.run~ on a top-level ~Lwt.t~ argument.  Note you can
re-run ~Lwt_main.run~ in a single program as many times as you want, but
perhaps you shouldn't run multiple ~Lwt_main.run~ in parallel.

There's an easy correspondence between basic operators.

| Async | Lwt |
|---|---|
| ~Deferred.bind~ | ~Lwt.bind~ |
| ~Deferred.return~ | ~Lwt.return~ |
| ~>>=~ | ~>>=~ |
| ~Deferred.map~ | ~Lwt.map~ |
| ~>>\vert~ | ~>\vert=~ |
| ~Deferred.don't_wait_for~ | ~Lwt.async~ |
| ~In_thread.run~ | ~Lwt_preemptive.detach~ |

*** Starvation worries

The most important difference between Async and Lwt is that *fulfilled promises are acted on immediately*,  whereas
Async kinda punts them to the end of a work queue and runs their thunks later.

A return loop like this starves the rest of Lwt:

#+begin_src ocaml
open Lwt.Infix

let main () =
  let rec loop () =
    Lwt.return ()
    >>= fun () ->
    loop ()
  in
  Lwt.async (loop ());
  Lwt_io.printlf "this line never prints!"
;;

let () = Lwt_main.run main ;;
#+end_src

whereas the corresponding Async loop does not starve:

#+begin_src ocaml
open! Async

let main () =
  let rec loop () =
    Deferred.return ()
    >>= fun () ->
    loop ()
  in
  don't_wait_for (loop ());
  printf "this line does print!\n";
  return ()
;;

let () =
  let cmd = Command.async_spec ~summary:"" Command.Spec.empty main in
  Command.run cmd
;;
#+end_src

Fortunately there's a workaround. You can get something closer to the Async-style behavior in Lwt by using ~Lwt.yield ()~ instead of ~Lwt.return ()~.

*** Spawning threads

From time to time you may need to run something in a system thread.   In Async you say ~In_thread.run~, whereas in
Lwt you say ~Lwt_preemptive.detach~.  For simple things they're pretty much interchangeable, but one stumbling point
for me was that in Async you can create a named thread and always use that for the ~In_thread.run~, with multiple
simultaneous dispatches to that thread becoming sequenced.

This is really useful for interacting with libraries that aren't so thread friendly.

Lwt's detach doesn't provide an easy way to do this out of the box, but I think you can still deal with thread
unfriendly libraries by using the ~Lwt_preemptive.run_in_main~ call.

Basically, never exit the detach thread you started to interact with your library, and instead have it block on
promise that gets filled through run_in_main.  In this way you can sequence your detached  Lwt thread similarly to
Async.

Happy to explain further if this is unclear.

*** Other libraries

~Async.Unix~ has a somewhat built-up conception of the UNIX API, whereas
~Lwt_main~ is more a direct mapping of ocaml's ~Unix~ module to promises.

Async ~Clock.every~ and ~Clock.after~ don't have exact analogs, but you can
make new versions pretty simply.

Example of a shallow imitation of Async ~Clock.every~
#+begin_src ocaml
let every span f =
  Lwt.async (fun () ->
    let span = Time.Span.to_sec span in
    let rec loop () =
      f ();
      Lwt_unix.sleep span
      >>= fun () ->
      loop ()
    in
    loop ())
;;
#+end_src

*Open questions*

I haven't sorted out a good Lwt substitute that's as comfortable as Async Pipe yet.   Though some combination of
Lwt_stream, Lwt_sequence and  ~lwt-pipe~ might fit the bill.  If you just happen to know already feel free to
cluephone.

*** Closing remarks

This is basically everything?  I'm almost suspicious that I'm not having more problems, but will happily accept grace
when it arises.

The Tezos project has a pipe-like module: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/src/lib_stdlib/lwt_pipe.mli
It hasn't been released as a standalone library (yet) but it is released as part of the ~tezos-stdlib~ package.

I haven't used Async's pipe, so I don't know how close of a match it is.

** Ivan Gotovchits announced


The OCaml Workshop will be held in the virtual format this year, which poses new challenges and requires people with
special talents and training. The Organizing Committee is seeking for members who will volunteer to fill one (or
more) of the following roles:

1. AV Editor
2. Session Host
3. Transcribers/Interpreter
4. Content Manager
5. Accessibility Chair

The roles are described in details below. We are asking prospective Organizing Committee members to contact the
Organizing Committee chair ([ivg@ieee.org](mailto:ivg@ieee.org)), indicating which role(s) they are ready to take.

*** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#av-editor][AV Editor]]

AV (Audio/Video) editors are responsible for previewing the presentations and providing help and feedback to the
authors. Ideally we target for one editor per talk.

**** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#duties][Duties]]

- Preview and (if necessary) post-process or (ask the author to shoot again) the pre-recorded videos.
- Advise authors and help in choice of software and hardware, teach how to set up the camera, light, make sure that the audio is of good quality and, in general, channel our quality guidelines.
- Ensure that all videos are of the same quality, the audio levels are the same, and that everything is loud and clear.

*** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#session-hosts][Session Hosts]]

Session hosts will assist session chairs in streaming the pre-recorded videos as well as helping and moderating the
Q&A sessions and the panel session. They will also be responsible for security and be ready to react to potential
threats and wrongdoers. Since we will broadcast sessions in several time zones we need several hosts for each
session.

**** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#duties][Duties]]

- Moderating the text chats
- Controlling microphones in the video-conferencing
- Watching for the time
- Performing sound checks
- Welcoming and otherwise guiding participants

*** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#transcribers-interpreters][Transcribers / Interpreters]]

We would like to have at least English transcriptions for each talk and translations to other languages are very
welcome. Transcriptions enable accessibility as well as potentially increase the audience and publicity as they could
be indexed by the search engines.

**** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#duties][Duties]]

- Create transcriptions for videos, potentially in other languages.

*** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#content-manager][Content Manager]]

The content manager will be responsible for maintaining the web presence of the conference on https://ocaml.org/. We
plan to have all videos available, as well as maintain a page for each submitted work.

*** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#accessibility-chair][Accessibility Chair]]

We are striving to make the conference accessible to everyone and we are looking for volunteers who have experience
in online accessibility.

**** [[https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020#duties][Duties]]

- Helping with the selection of accessible platforms and tools.
- Working with attendees to ensure the necessary access services are included.
- Establishing best practices for preparing and running accessible sessions.
