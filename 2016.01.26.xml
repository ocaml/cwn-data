Thanks Thomas! We're all very excited about driving MirageOS forward now to
the wider community.

If anyone wants to take part in a friendly (and warm) atmosphere, the first
hackathon is being held in Marrakech in the second week of March:
http://marrakech2016.mirage.io/

Please do feel free to get in touch at &lt;marrakech2016@mirage.io&gt; with any
questions, but all levels of OCaml hackers interested in unikernels are
welcome.

      <cwn_title>Package renamings for sexplib, bin_prot and a few other camlp4 syntax extensions</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-01/msg00083.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Jeremie Dimino announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
In preparation for the 113.24 release of Jane Street packages, which are
camlp4-free, we moved some Camlp4 syntax extensions into their own packages
[1]. As a result some findlib packages have been renamed. For instance the old
sexplib.syntax is now called pa_sexp_conv.

Details and upgrading instructions can be found in the opam repository
changelog [2].

Since the upcoming 113.24 release of sexplib, bin_prot and a few other
packages breaks compatibility due to these renamings, version constraints were
automatically added to the appropriate opam packages.

This is the list of affected packages:

- async-zmq
- bookaml
- camlhighlight
- charrua-core
- cohttp
- colors_js
- conduit
- cstruct
- extprot
- ezjsonm
- frenetic
- git-unix
- ibx
- ipaddr
- irmin
- lambdoc
- lazy-trie
- merge-queues
- merge-ropes
- mirage
- mirage-git
- mirage-http
- mirage-tc
- mirage-types
- mirage-types-lwt
- mustache
- nocrypto
- obeanstalk
- ocaml-markdown
- oloop
- openflow
- operf-macro
- opium
- otr
- packet
- perf
- planck
- protocol-9p
- qcow-format
- shared-block-ring
- sibylfs
- sill
- tls
- tlstunnel
- topology
- uri
- vchan
- x509
- xapi-backtrace
- xapi-stdext
- xapi-xenopsd
- xentropyd

If you maintain any of these packages, you are kindly invited to follow the
upgrading instructions [2].

Moving forward, we encourage people using any of our Camlp4 syntax extensions
to switch to their ppx replacements.
