We are glad to announce the beta release of BuckleScript[1], a backend for the
OCaml compiler which emits JavaScript.

A simple example is available here:
<a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript/#a-simple-example">https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript/#a-simple-example</a>

As examples of that vision, using BuckleScript, OCaml users can use Chrome Dev
Tools to debug OCaml code, while Javascript users can use OCaml libraries as
plain npm[2] packages.

The project is inspired by js_of_ocaml[3], its goal is to engage OCaml with
average JavaScript developers. For this release, its FFI ([5], [6]) is not
complete but quite rich and stable, we encourage you to try and share feedback
with us!

Thanks -- Hongbo

I'm glad to announce the first release of bindings OCaml to Cordova plugins
available here: <a href="https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list">https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list</a>.

These bindings allow you to develop hybrid mobile applications (Android, iOS,
Windows Phone, etc) in OCaml and get access to camera to take pictures,
geolocation, file system, accelerometer, etc with a high level abstraction in
OCaml.

Combined with js_of_ocaml, you develop client hybrid mobile applications only in
OCaml.

It's very easy to use and easy to install.

If you have any questions or remarks, don't hesitate to send me a message.

It is with great pleasure that I announce the initial release of angstrom, a
parser-combinator library that I have been developing over the past several
months:

<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom</a>
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/angstrom">http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/angstrom</a>

Angstrom exposes monadic and applicative interfaces for composition, and
supports incremental input through buffered and unbuffered interfaces. Both
interfaces give the user total control over the blocking behavior of their
application, with the unbuffered interface enabling zero-copy IO. Parsers are
backtracking by default and support unbounded lookahead.

Whereas many OCaml parser combinator libraries claim heritage from the Parsec[0]
Haskell library, angstrom instead follows the design and semantics of
attoparsec[1], hence the name[2]. For a high-level comparison of Angstrom's
features to other parser-combinator libraries, see the table included in the
README:

<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom#comparison-to-other-libraries">https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom#comparison-to-other-libraries</a>

The source distribution ships with a JSON parser, which I've benchmarked against
ezjsonm and yojson. Yojson wins hands down (it benefits greatly from not having
to support non-blocking incremental input), though the angstrom-based parser
comes in second both in terms of latency and allocations. The results can be
found here:

<a href="https://gist.github.com/seliopou/7487875d36914efe74f736aaa3fbed16">https://gist.github.com/seliopou/7487875d36914efe74f736aaa3fbed16</a>

There are several more performance improvements in the pipeline, which should
further reduce allocation rates, in some cases dramatically so. More on that in
the next release, along with other developments.

As always, issues and pull requests are welcomed.

&gt; Do you have a story for precise line-column and byte count tracking ? It's quite
&gt; important in practice to be able to give good error reports.

Angstrom's targeting the use case of network protocols and serialization
formats, a use case where line/column numbers are of dubious value, and doesn't
really make sense when dealing with binary formats. So it will likely never
support line/column tracking. It will however at some point report character
position on failure. I have a local branch that implements it, though it's
untested.

&gt; Also does the API easily allow to do best-effort decoding (after reporting an
&gt; error allow to resync input by discarding and restart the parsing process) ?

From what I understand, this would require users to modify input rather than
putting any correction logic into the parser itself. Angstrom does not support
this functionality, and likely won't. In principle the only change necessary
would be to simply surface the success continuation on failure. Everything else
is accessible to the user (except for failure position, see above). Why it's
valuable to do this outside of the parser is unclear to me though.

&gt;&gt; Yojson wins hands down (it benefits greatly from not having to support
&gt;&gt; non-blocking incremental input),

&gt; I guess it also benefits of not implementing the standard at all, e.g. it won't
&gt; check the validity of the underlying character stream.

&gt; Also regarding benchmarks it would be more interesting to have benchmarks on
&gt; real world examples where you convert json input to concrete ocaml data types.
&gt; E.g. it would be cool if you could provide a jsonm-like streaming interface
&gt; with angstrom and then use angstrom's combinators to parse the stream of json
&gt; lexeme into OCaml data structures.

Doing that would seem to muddle application and library performance measurements
within the benchmark. Arguably, constructing a generic in-memory representation
is doing the same in essence. At least this way it's an "application" that's
easy for benchmarks to standardize on (more or less) and implement, so that one
can use the benchmark results to compare different libraries.

But anyways, there's nothing in principle preventing it from happening. There
parser would look something like this:

skip_many (token &gt;&gt;| (handler : json_token -&gt; unit))
      </pre><i>Daniel Bünzli then replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Angstrom's targeting the use case of network protocols and serialization
&gt; formats, a use case where line/column numbers are of dubious value,

Well when you are dealing with large malformed json streams it's nice to know
where they error… But if you target binary data only a byte count should
suffice.
  
&gt; From what I understand, this would require users to modify input rather than
&gt; putting any correction logic into the parser itself.

No the parser itself is in charge of performing this. A very simple example of
this is when you get an UTF-8 decode error. You want to be able to report the
error and let the client restart the decode which is easy to do by finding a
synchronization byte in the input. But again this may not be useful for binary
protocols, it is however useful for decoding text and parsing languages.
  
&gt; Doing that would seem to muddle application and library performance
&gt; measurements within the benchmark. Arguably, constructing a generic in-memory
&gt; representation is doing the same in essence.

Not really, it can completely change the outcome of your benchmarks. For example
jsonm allows you to completely eschew going through a generic in-memory
representation before being able to extract the data.

(with subtitles, and a broader call)</h3><p>Archive: <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-07/msg00233.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-07/msg00233.html</a></p><i>Roberto Di Cosmo announced:</i><br /><pre>
We announced the opening of the registrations for the OCaml Mooc a little more
than a week ago, and we got several great suggestions on how to improve the
communication around this course.

As a first point, we forgot to mention that the course is indeed in English, but
subtitles are available, both in English and French (thanks to a great many
volunteers, with special thanks to Jean-Francois Monin that took care of the
french version entirely by himself!)

As a second remark, we need to reach out to a wider public that does not know
much of functional programming or OCaml, while the text of the previous
announcement was more oriented to our own community.

You will find here below an announcement text specifically designed for a
broader community (with many thanks to Julia Lawall for her help!)

Feel free to forward wherever you may see fit: let's not be shy, future
functional programmers may hide in unexpected places!

Learn functional programming with the OCaml programming language: registrations are open!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional programming is attracting interest from a broad range of
developers because it allows to write expressive, concise and elegant
programs.

The course "Introduction to Functional programming using the OCaml
language" introduces gradually the central notions of functional
programming, via a set of video courses that are complemented by a rich set
of interesting exercises that you can perform fully in your browser... Yes,
this means you can start learning functional programming without any
hassle: nothing to install, nothing to tune up: the programming environment
is just one click away!

During the course, you will discover powerful mechanisms that allow to
build and manipulate complex data structures in a clean and efficient way.
And you will see how functions play a central role, as first-class values
that can be freely used in any place where an expression can appear.

Registrations are already open at

<a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/parisdiderot/56002S02/session02/about">https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/parisdiderot/56002S02/session02/about</a>

The course will start on September 26th 2016, and will run for six weeks.

Your expected effort is between 2 and 6 hours per week, depending on your
background, including the time spent watching the the short video sequences
of the course, that total approximately an hour per week.

This may seem a significant effort, but at the end of the course you will
have actually learned a lot: the final programming project will confirm
that you acquired a good mastery of functional programming and the ability
to develop medium sized programs with ease.

Thousands of learners attended the first run of this course that ended in
January 2016, and the many that completed it were extremely satisfied.

To introduce you to functional programming, we have chosen to use the
OCaml programming language. OCaml is a rich, elegant, efficient programming
language that reconciles the conciseness and flexibility of untyped
programming languages (like Python, for example) with the safety of
strongly typed programming languages (like Java, for example), and that has
a vibrant user community.

Facebook, Microsoft, JaneStreet, Bloomberg are some big names in industry
that adopted OCaml to develop cutting edge applications. The research
community uses OCaml for writing tools like the proof assistant Coq, the
Coccinelle program transformer, the Frama-C code analyser, or the Astree
static analyser. Several start ups use OCaml to obtain tenfold gains in
productivity and stability of their code base.

Once you have started mastering functional programming using OCaml, we are
sure that other programming languages will never look the same to you
again.

This course will be held in English, but subtitles are already available
both in English and in French.

Prerequisites
-------------

To take full advantage of this course you should have already some basic
knowledge of computer programming, in particular you should already know
how to write simple computer programs in some programming language. For
instance, you should know concepts like variables (or identifiers),
functions (or procedures, methods), conditionals, and loops.
