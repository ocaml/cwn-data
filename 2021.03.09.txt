  I started to work on a new project recently: My goal is to provide an
  iOS app for beginners to learn OCaml and practice on their device.  I
  think it is a good idea to get started easily.

  Here are some screenshots of what I’ve done so far:

  I’m open to feedback and opinion about this project idea


Nathan Fallet then added

  I made it available for pre order on the App Store - I will keep
  improving it with time, and I think it can be a great tool for
  beginners

  This is really cool. I just want to point out that your app is the
  sole search result for 'OCaml' in the App Store.  So that's a first
  :-)

  Incidentally, there is an 'OCaml Toplevel' app on the Android Play
  Store:
  <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.vernoux.ocaml>

  Your app looks more sophisticated though. Hopefully one day we have
  something like [Swift Playgrounds] and people can start learning OCaml
  interactively on their devices directly.

ERic (Entity-Relation interactive calculator) version 0.3

Damien Guichard announced

  The [programming languages zoo] is a great resource for wanna-be
  interpreter/compiler writers. The [ICFP 2000 programming contest] is
  another great resource for wanna-be ray tracers. However until now
  there has been no OCaml resource for wanna-be Knowledge Representation
  tool-ers. This makes sound like KR tool is a more difficult area than
  other projects. ERic v0.3 demonstrates the opposite as it's about 1200
  lines size (lexer & hand-written parser included) and reads/writes a
  [Conceptual Graph] Interchange Format (CGIF) notation.

Claude Jager-Rubinson announced

  Please join us next Tuesday at 7pm Central time for the second meeting
  of OCaml Café.  Zoom connection info is available at [Houston
  Functional Programmers].

  OCaml Café offers a friendly, low stakes opportunity to ask questions
  about the OCaml language and ecosystem, work through programming
  problems that you’re stuck on, and get feedback on your code.
  Especially geared toward new and intermediate users, experienced OCaml
  developers will be available to answer your questions.

  Whether you’re still trying to make sense of currying or can spot
  non-tail-recursive code from across the room, we hope that you’ll join
  us with your questions about OCaml, or just to hang out with the OCaml
  community.

Functional Programming User Study (Specifically in OCaml)

Ahan Malhotra announced

  We are doing user studies to help us understand how to help people
  understand and navigate complex information about programming
  documentation, *specifically in OCaml*. You will complete a series
  tasks that help us understand working memory and how you navigate a
  new interface. After examining a layout of the data (interface) for a
  short, predetermined amount of time, you will be asked a set of
  comprehension and/or qualitative questions to measure whether the
  methods of presenting this information has any impact on your
  performance.

  *The study will take around 55 minutes, and you will be entered into a
  lottery for a $150 Amazon gift card as compensation for your time.*

  *A bit more about this study*

  The user study will be done virtually on Zoom. You will be asked to
  various tasks with the interface. The interface is deployed as a
  public web application so you don’t have to install anything. This
  research is governed by Harvard University's Committee on the Use of
  Human Subjects.

  *Eligibility*

  You also don’t have to be an expert in anything to participate. You
  just need to be fluent in English and over 18 years of age.

  If you are interested, please fill out this survey to confirm your
  eligibility, and we will follow up to schedule the study session:
  <https://forms.gle/q6vkyEE2tSjjZoiSA>

  If you have any questions, please email
  ahanmalhotra@college.harvard.edu.


OCaml 4.12.0 released (with 4.11.2 too)

Continuing this thread from last week, Hannes Mehnert said
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Congratulations to the new release. For the curious who intend to
  install a flambda version of 4.12 and are surprised that
  `ocaml-variants.4.12.0+flambda' does not exist, from [this thread] the
  opam layout has changed, and now the following works:

  ┌────
  │ $ opam sw create <my-switch-name> --packages=ocaml-variants.4.12.0+options,ocaml-options-only-flambda
  └────

  There are more configuration options available, take a look at the
  output of `opam search ocaml-option' for all options. (I've not been
  involved with this development. I don't quite understand why there is
  for each `Y' a `ocaml-option-Y' and a `ocaml-options-only-Y'.) I also
  have not figured out whether there's a way to pass `-O3' in the just
  created switch.

  Maybe it is worth to embed such information in the very nicely styled
  OCaml manual (considering that opam got quite some traction over the
  years and is recommended for OCaml developers)?
