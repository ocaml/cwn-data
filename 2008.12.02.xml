&gt; In this thread
&gt; http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2001/04/8bbf7629ef3ef299c16f78bd2b986e36.en.html
&gt; David Mentre announces a preliminary work on binding for the cudd
&gt; library, but the link is broken... this link currently is broken:
&gt; http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~mentre/software/ocaml-bdd/ 
&gt; and there is a mention to a caml-light implementation of a robdd library
&gt; that I was also not able to retrieve.

The code was a binding for CMU bdd library
(&lt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/bdd.html&gt;). It was working great at
that time (OCaml 3.00) and is rather simple. I have no idea if it would
still work with recent OCaml (let me know).

I put the archive on the web. Code is under a BSD license.

Code provided as is. I mean... really. ;-)

			<cwn_title>OCaml 3.11.0 release candidate</cwn_title>
			<cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/0ec06867774922fd#</cwn_url>
			<cwn_who>Damien Doligez announced</cwn_who>
			<cwn_what>
We are closing in on version 3.11.0.  A Release Candidate is now available.
If there are no show-stoppers in this RC, then 3.11.0 will be officially
released next week.

The release candidate is available here:
&lt;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.11/&gt;
(look for 3.11.0+rc1)

As usual, we need a few brave souls to try and install it on their
favourite architecture and report the result to me.

For these topics about comparing libraries, there is an attempt at 
collaborative work to build quick but comprehensive overview : 
http://wiki.cocan.org/comparisons/ 

About the current question (XML), you can find there the names of a few 
other tools.
