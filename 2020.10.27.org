* Bisect_ppx, the coverage tool, now has excellent integration with Dune
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/bisect-ppx-the-coverage-tool-now-has-excellent-integration-with-dune/6634/1

** Anton Bachin announced


[[https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx][*Bisect_ppx*]], the coverage tool, has just had its [[https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx/releases/tag/2.5.0][2.5.0]] release, in which the
main addition is a very neat integration with Dune:

#+begin_src shell
dune runtest --instrument-with bisect_ppx --force
#+end_src

This uses the new [[https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/instrumentation.html?highlight=instrument-with][instrumentation support]] added in Dune 2.7.0, and is a considerable
improvement over the dubious methods Bisect and its users were previously forced to rely on :)

It is no longer necessary to edit ~dune~ files for a release, as Bisect only becomes a dependency of
your project when ~--instrument-with bisect_ppx~ is supplied on the Dune command line, which is only
during development and in CI. This makes projects ready for release from any commit. Dune also now
knows to rebuild affected files when instrumentation is turned on or off, so you don't have to manually
run ~dune clean~ in between. Everything just works the way it should.

See the updated [[https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx#Dune][instructions]] for all the details on how to use this integration.

I've also adapted [[https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup][Lambda Soup]] as a simple full-project example. See its
[[https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup/blob/a0cbf54bf9affda00455c54369e473b905458114/lambdasoup.opam#L17-L22][~opam~]],
[[https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup/blob/master/dune-project#L1][~dune-project~]],
[[https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup/blob/a0cbf54bf9affda00455c54369e473b905458114/src/dune#L7][~dune~]],
and
[[https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup/blob/a0cbf54bf9affda00455c54369e473b905458114/Makefile#L15][~Makefile~]].

Bisect_ppx still supports all the older integrations, so if you have an existing setup, you don't have
to edit it. Support may eventually be removed in the future, however, so I encourage users to gradually
update.

See the full [[https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx/releases/tag/2.5.0][changelog]] for information on bugs fixed by the release.

Thanks to the Dune team for adding ~--instrument-with~, to @undu for supporting it on the Bisect side,
and to all the Bisect_ppx users and contributors!

Happy testing!

* First release of FSML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-fsml/6645/1

** jserot announced


This is to announce the first public release of FSML, an OCaml library for describing and describing
synchronous finite state machines.

FSML is a simplified version of the library provided in the [[http://github.com/jserot/rfsm][Rfsm]]
package for which

- the system is composed of a single FSM

- this FSM has a single, implicit, triggering event (typically called the  *clock* , hence the term *synchronous*  used in the description)

The FSML library provides

- a type  ~Fsm.t~  for describing FSMs
  - possibly having  *local variables*
  - for which  *transitions* , implicitely triggered by a clock, are defined by a set of  *boolean guards*  and a set of  *actions*

- a set of PPX extensions for building values of type  ~Fsm.t~

- functions for producing and viewing graphical representations of FSMs in the  ~.dot~ format

- functions for saving and reading FSM representations in files using the JSON format

- functions for performing single or multi-step simulations of FSMs and generating trace files in the ~.vcd~  format to be viewed by VCD viewers such as [[http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/][gtkwave]]

- functions for generating C or VHDL code from a FSM representation (for  integration into existing
code and/or simulation)

FSML is available from [[https://github.com/jserot/fsml][Github]] or as an [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/fsml][OPAM
package]].

QR codes are unsightly – a mirror of their specification. But they enable all sorts of neat tricks now
that scanners for them are in many pockets.

Qrc generate them:

* cumulus 0.0.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-cumulus-0-0-1/6655/1

** Petter A. Urkedal announced


I would like to announce a new FRP library built on the React library.  The purpose of
[[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-cumulus/][cumulus]] is to help organize code which work on
differential updates.  The main type is the *cumulus signal*, which is analogous to a react signal,
except that information about the difference from the previous value is provided to consumers along
with the new value, when the cumulus signal changes.

So, why does a cumulus signal provide both the state and the difference to downstream signals?  That
is, what is the difference between the following:?
#+begin_src ocaml
type t1 = state * change React.E     (* initial value and even of changes *)
type t2 = (state, change) Cumulus.t  (* the cumulus signal *)
#+end_src
The former type presumes that after the consumer has received the initial state, it will only need to
know what changes on successive updates.  This seems quite natural.  It works well if, for instance, we
want to reconstruct a signal holding a set of strings, given an initial set and a series of additions
and removals:
#+begin_src ocaml
module String_set = Set.Make (String)

type 'a set_patch = [`Add of string | `Remove of string]
type 'a update = 'a -> 'a

let patch_string_set : string set_patch -> String_set.t update = function
 | `Add x -> String_set.add x
 | `Remove x -> String_set.remove x

let integrate_strings (init, changes) =
  React.E.fold (fun l p -> patch_string_set p l) init changes
#+end_src
But what if we want to maintain a signal holding the intersection of two sets of strings?  If we try to
lift the intersection operation to work on patches, we discover that learning about the addition of an
element to left-hand set is not sufficient to determine whether the element shall the added to the
resulting set; we also need to know whether the element is a member of the right-hand set.  So, in this
case we would instead use cumulus signals:
#+begin_src ocaml
let cu : (String_set.t, string set_patch) Cumulus.t = ...
let cv : (String_set.t, string set_patch) Cumulus.t = ...
let cuv =
  let init u v = String_set.inter u v in
  let patch (u, du) (v, dv) r' =
    (match du, dv with
     | None, Some x when String_set.mem x u ->
        Cumulus.Patch (String_set.add x r', `Add1 x)
     ...)
  in
  Cumulus.l2 ~init ~patch cu cv
#+end_src
For the complete example, using integers instead of strings, see [[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-cumulus/blob/master/tests/test_isecn.ml][~test_isecn.ml~]] from the
testsuite.

(Footnote:  If consumers know how to integrate the states they depend on, they could in principle keep
their own record of the full states of the arguments.  But this would be inefficient if there are many
consumers, and there is also a simplification of code and possibly improved abstraction in letting the
producer maintain its own state.)

Formally, we can understand the difference between ~t1~ and ~t2~ in terms of calculus.  For instance,
the differential of a product ~d(x·y) = dx·y + x·dy~ contains a mix of both the differentials and
values of the two variables.  But if the expression is linear, only differentials will will occur:
~d(a·x + b·y + c) = a·dx + b·dy~.  So, when ~t1~ is sufficient, we are dealing with the analogue of a
linear function.  The above example could be turned into a linear one by making ~Labels.t~ a multiset
type and considering the multiset union operation.

Thus far we only considered purely functional code, but a cumulus signal may chose to modify and return
the same physical state during an update.  Also note when designing the differential component of the
cumulus signal, that we may exploit the fact the consumers also may inspect the corresponding new
state.  Combining these two points, a cumulus signal holding an array might have the type ~('a array,
[`Set of int | `Resize of int])~. Here the state may be reused for ~`Set~ and replaced for
~`Resize~.

On a related not, there is also the [[https://github.com/ocsigen/reactiveData][reactiveData]] library which deals with (linear) patching of
containers.

I must also mention that there there is an [[https://github.com/Cumulus/Cumulus][OCaml project with the same name]] (except casing). Sorry
for not checking thoroughly in advance. I hope it is not an issue in practise, otherwise there is still
time to rename while the library is fresh.
      



* Brr 0.0.1, a toolkit for programming browsers

** Continuing this thread, Yoann Padioleau asked Daniel Bünzli replied


#+begin_quote
What are the differences with the default bindings provided in js_of_ocaml to the browser APIs (e.g.,
js.mli, dom.mli, etc.)?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure exactly what you are asking but:

1. If you are asking about the way API are exposed: ~brr~ does not type JavaScript's objects as phantom types. It simply relies on OCaml's abstract data types and plain functions. More about this can be found in brr's [[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/ffi_manual.html][FFI manual]] and [[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/ffi_cookbook.html][FFI cookbook]].
2. If you are asking about binding coverage, you should be able to get a sense of what is bound in ~brr~ [[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/index.html#supported_apis][here]].

Regarding 2. ~brr~'s coverage of more recent browser APIs is broader and more consistent than in
~js_of_ocaml~ – Promise support, Fetch, Service workers, Media capture APIs, WebGL2, Webcrypto,
WebAudio, etc. Conversly older APIs supported in ~js_of_ocaml~ may not supported in ~brr~ (e.g.
XMLHTTPRequest). Besides ~brr~'s coverage of some of the DOM *element-specific* interfaces may be
shallower than in ~js_of_ocaml~. There is however good coverage for the
[[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/Brr_io/Media/index.html#el][~HTMLMediaElement~]],
[[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/Brr_canvas/Canvas/index.html][~HTMLCanvasElement~]],
[[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/Brr_io/Form/index.html][~HTMLFormElement~]] and
[[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/Brr/El/index.html#ifaces][~HTMLInputElement~]] interfaces. For
the rest the [[https://erratique.ch/software/brr/doc/Brr/El/index.html#ats_and_props][attribute and property
API]] and the occasional trivial
FFI method binding should be able to get you a long way.
