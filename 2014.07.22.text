My belief is that there is room for a less ambitious, plug-in based
(statically or dynamically linked) annotation mechanism, on top of
PPX. For instance, if we consider the current use of camlp4, we can
assume that most ppxs will probably just define some annotation on
some specific kind of AST node in order to rewrite them and / or
insert auxiliary code, without carrying so much state. Having a common
mechanism for registering such common simple tasks and assigning to
names to them could be useful, without breaking the model.

In practice, an annotation would simply be declared as an OCaml module
calling predefined specific registration functions. Such a module,
linked with a predefined main module would produce a stand alone ppx
binary processing only this annotation. However, it gives the
possibility to compose annotations more finely, without changing the
semantics. As I mentioned previously, It could limit the number of
tree rewrites, but it could have other advantages such as detecting
annotation name clashes.

We launched this thread because we thought that such a mechanism has
more chances to be adopted if previously discussed and understood by
build systems, but perhaps the best solution is that we propose such
a ppx helper and then wait and see.

I agree on this. Annotations give us the possibility to make OCaml
files more self content and build-system independent. I though see
a distinction between compiler directed pragmas and build-system
directed ones.

Well, one of the use cases of extension nodes is to integrate external
notations into literals such as [%json{| ... |}]. I believe IDEs could
still use a little help to know how to format these, instead of
showing plain OCaml strings.

The registration mechanism exists:  a ppx processor is supposed to
call Ast_mapper.register.  By default, this runs directly the main
program to support for ppx protocol for this single processor, but you
can very well override the behavior of Ast_mapper.register by calling
Ast_mapper.register_function first.

You can look at <https://github.com/alainfrisch/ppx_drivers> for an
experiment of creating such a driver.

But this notion of registration is quite independent on how multiple
processors interact.  I'm yet to be convinced that a composition mode
more fine-grained that function composition is worth the extra mental
overhead.  It would also be necessary to decide between top-down and
bottom-up rewriting, none of them being the best pick for all
processors.  Typically, a macro expander would want other processors
to apply to the result of macro expansions (i.e. top-down rewriting
style), while a type-conv-like processor might prefer a bottom-up
rewriting (so that the macro expander can run first on type
declarations before it takes control).

Concerning the notion of state in ppx processors, I've written the
following ppx processors:

 - sedlex (a lexer generator): it needs to remember about all lexer
definitions in the current unit to be able to generate some global
function definitions (shared by various lexers)  (for instance, we
don't want to generate definitions used only by code that would be
excluded by a conditional compilation processor)

 - ppx_metaquot: some extension nodes with very short names %e, %t, %p
are recognized only in the context of an enclosing extension node such
as %expr
( <https://github.com/alainfrisch/ppx_tools/blob/master/ppx_metaquot.ml> )

I expect most other ppx processors to be slightly more complex than
purely local transformations, which makes it even more difficult to
reason on local composition (and "purely local" term rewriting systems
are already hard to reason about their composition).

Indeed, although I think this is going to be a rather rare use of
extension points / quoted strings.

2) Existential row types
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-07/msg00092.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Alain Frisch asked:

GADTs allow to restrict existential type variables to being an
instance of a row type, as in:

class type c = ...

type s =
  | EX: ((#c as 'a) -> unit) * (unit -> 'a) -> ex


I'm wondering if it is possible to simulate such restricted
existential quantification with first-class module and private row
types.  Something like:


module type S = sig
  type t = private #c
  val f: t -> unit
  val g: unit -> t
end

let foo (type t_) (f : (#c as t_) -> unit) (g : unit -> t_) =
  let module M = struct
    type t = t_
    let f = f
    let g = g
  end
  in
  (module M : S)


This does not work, of course, because of the "... as t_".  Is there
a local work-around?  If not, I'm wondering if if would be easy (and
make sense) to introduce a form for introducing locally private row
types:

 let foo (type t_ = private #c) (f : t_ -> unit) (g : unit -> t_) = ...
      
** Leo White then replied:

There is a work-around, but it is quite convoluted:

There is also a feature request for the feature you propose:

  <http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6137>
      
** Alain Frisch then replied:

Very clever trick. Thanks!

One can actually use the GADT only to carry the constraint and pass
the value argument(s) separately.  This means the GADT definition
remains very simple even if we need to add many fields:


=============================================================
class type c = object end

module type SIG =
sig
  type t = private #c
  val f: t -> unit
  val g: unit -> t
end

type 'a aux = Aux: (#c as 'a) aux

let create f g =
  let helper (type u) (Aux : u aux) f g =
    (module struct
       type t = u
       let f = f
       let g = g
     end : SIG)
  in
  helper Aux f g

(* or even: *)

let create f g =
  let module Aux = struct type 'a t = E: (#c as 'a) t end in
  begin fun (type u) (Aux.E : u Aux.t) f g ->
    (module struct
       type t = u
       let f = f
       let g = g
     end : SIG)
  end Aux.E f g

** Continuing the thread from last week, Damien Doligez said:

First note that we are not breaking backward compatibility: you can
always use the -unsafe-string flag to compile your dusty code.

As you said, bigarrays are the best suited for that kind of code.
But that's not a good reason to make all strings as heavy as bigarrays.
If you need bigarrays, by all means use bigarrays in your code, not
String or Bytes.

This is almost the same as our first version, which we discarded as
too complex and not compatible enough (as you noted, because of
unresolved type variables). But it might make a come-back.

OK, we need to be clearer on the "how" (in an nutshell, the default will
switch from -unsafe-string to -safe-string at some point in the future
when we feel that enough of the existing code has been updated).
As for the "when", we can't tell because that depends a lot on how fast
the community updates its code. Hopefully no more than three years.
Possibly as soon as 4.03.0.

That's a good idea.

What about programmers who deliberately trigger the bug (aka "attackers",
in a security setting)? It's not just about how unlikely a bug is, but
also whether it can be exploited.

If stringlike is polymorphic, you will need a new regexp library that
operates on stringlike. We cannot update the current regexp library to
use stringlike because that would introduce polymorphism and unresolved
type variables, and that might break some of the code that used to run
on 1.03...

First, we mark them deprecated. Then we wait a very long time before we
actually remove them from (if ever).
      
** Alain Frisch also commented:

Coming back to motivating example of this post.

Lexing provides:

val from_channel : in_channel -> lexbuf
val from_string : string -> lexbuf
val from_function : (bytes -> int -> int) -> lexbuf

In particular, from_function expects you to write to a buffer, so it's
pretty clear that its callback must accept a "bytes", not
a "string". There is no place for a (string -> int -> int) -> lexbuf
function.

Concerning from_string: this function copies the string to an internal
buffer.  This is purely implemented on the OCaml side without any
unsafe features.  We could avoid this copy because we know that the
generated lexers won't actually modify the buffer in that case, but it
would be very difficult to do this without using an unsafe feature,
even if we had some sort of generalization of bytes and string.  We
would instead need a completely different implementation (which would
not use "stringable" to make the "source" (string or "stream")
explicit in the lexbuf datastructure.

We could also provide an extra from_bytes function, but it can
currently be implemented by composing Bytes.to_string and
Lexing.from_string.  Are you concerned only by the performance
overhead of this approach (two copies)?  If so, the same argument
would apply to the current implementation of from_string, and we would
need to switch to a different approach, for which it's not clear that
"stringable" would be a big help (see above).  Before doing anything
like that, it would be interesting to evaluate the exact overhead.  It
could very well be negligible/acceptable for most cases compared to
the cost of actual lexing.

6) A proposal of a standard support for Unicode string
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-07/msg00107.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yoriyuki Yamagata announced:

I write a blog post <http://yoriyuki.info/en/blog/2014/07/18/unicode/>
which proposes inclusion of Unicode strings in OCaml standard
distribution.

The reason for this proposal can be summarized as follows.

1   Type for human readable text is too important to left out from the
  standard distribution, in particular from the beginner's perspective

2   This enhances interpolability of Unicode processing libraries

3   This suppresses the current dangerous practice that raw UTF-8
  encoded string is used for Unicode string.

I hope this stimulates the further discussion of human readable texts
in OCaml
      
** Török Edwin then replied:

Just my two cents:

I don't think that iterating on codepoints is the fundamental
operation for Unicode strings, there are too many pitfalls to be aware
of (unless you are writing a low-level Unicode library such as
normalization, regular expression matching, etc.).

From a user's perspective I think you need mostly these operations:
  * create a valid UTF-8 string (reject invalid ones)
  * be able to put Unicode strings in standard containers
    (i.e. comparison and hash functions)
  * transform Unicode strings (normalize, case-fold)
  * Unicode regular expressions (UTS#18)
  * Unicode text segmentation (UTS#29)
  * Unicode collation algorithms (UTS#10)

The regular expressions could be used to match/replace/split the
Unicode string just as you would use String.index/String.sub, and it
could be used to find/access the Unicode properties of unicode
characters.  And Unicode text segmentation can be used to define more
useful iterators than codepoint-by-codepoint.  If performance is
a concern specialized implementations could be provided for commonly
used expressions.

Now of course this is only my view and someone else would consider
other Unicode features to be more important.  Also Unicode evolves,
there could be bugs in the implementation, etc. so I don't think this
is suitable to be baked in the compiler-provided standard library.

At least such a "high-level" Unicode library should be prototyped and
fully implemented outside the compiler (based on the already existing
uu* libraries perhaps).  Then see what problems people face when using
it, and then tested out in a "standard library" such as Batteries or
Core, and only then be made part of the compiler's standard library.

Given that recently there's been a tendency to split-out functionality
from the OCaml distribution (camlp4, ocamlbuild, etc.) I don't think
that adding such complicated and evolving Unicode algorithms to the
standard library is the way to go.  I'd rather see the standard
library deprecate/remove the ASCII-specific interfaces (or move them
to a submodule).

As for the compiler itself it could provide some useful functionality,
not sure if it is required:
  * warn when string literals are not valid UTF-8
  * support for \u
  * if there will be [`String|`Bytes ] stringlike there could be
    a 'type unicode = `Unicode stringlike' and some way to make literal
    strings be of type unicode, with the actual unicode implementation
    left to a user library
