* ppx_yojson: a ppx extension for Yojson literals and patterns

** Nathan Rebours announced


I'm happy to announce the release of ~ppx_yojson~ a rewriter for all of you out there working with ~Yojson~. Version ~0.1.0~ provides an extension to write ~Yojson~ literal expressions in a more concise and readable way.

As an example, you can write:
#+begin_src ocaml
let json = [%yojson {some_string = "string"; some_list = [1; 2; 3]}]
#+end_src
instead of:
#+begin_src ocaml
let json =
  `Assoc
    [ ("some_string", `String "string")
    ; ("some_list", `List [`Int 1; `Int 2; `Int 3])
    ]
#+end_src

It's available on [[https://github.com/NathanReb/ppx_yojson][github]] and [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ppx_yojson/][opam]].
There's more to come soon, including extensions for patterns and antiquotations. You can see the full list of features goals for the ~1.0.0~ [[https://github.com/NathanReb/ppx_yojson/issues/1][here]].
      



* Releases: ppx_deriving_cmdliner, Genspio, Febusy

:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-releases-ppx-deriving-cmdliner-genspio-febusy/2670/1

** Sebastien Mondet announced


Hi, this week I cleaned-up and released 3 packages:

*** → Genspio 0.0.2

Genspio is a typed EDSL used to generate shell scripts and commands from OCaml.

The idea is to build values of type ~'a Genspio.EDSL.t~ with the combinators in the ~Genspio.EDSL~ module, and compile them to POSIX shell scripts (or one-liners) with functions from ~Genspio.Compile~.

See Genspio's documentation root at https://smondet.gitlab.io/genspio-doc/.

New in 0.0.2:

- Now, the default ~EDSL~ module “hides” the distinction between C-Strings and byte-arrays from the user. The distinction was introduced in the second version 0.0.1, cf. discussion in my OCaml 2017 [[http://wr.mondet.org/slides/OCaml2017-Genspio/][talk]].
- The lower-level API is still there in the module ~EDSL_v0~.
- There is a new compiler (~EDSL.Compile.Slow_flow~) which is still just a compiler to POSIX shell scripts, but it uses (many) temporary files to overall simplify the generated code. The goal is to bypass bugs in shells that cannot really handle complex POSIX expressions (one example of which is the quite old version of ~bash~ shipped with Mac OSX).
- Lots of documentation work, including improvements to the ~js_of_ocaml~ [[https://smondet.gitlab.io/genspio-doc/demo/genspio.0.0.2/index.html][toplevel-website]].
- A new biggish example: [[https://github.com/hammerlab/genspio/blob/master/src/examples/service_composer.ml][~src/examples/service_composer.ml~]] which is a code generator for the “COSC” project (Github: [[https://github.com/smondet/cosc][~smondet/cosc~]]), a family of scripts which manage long-running processes in a GNU-Screen session (a bit in the style of ~docker-compose~).
- Also a lot of test hacking, including ~vm_tester.ml~ which generates Qemu-based testing setups (e.g. a build of Darwin 8.0 to test very old OSX environments).

(release PR: [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/12738][~ocaml/opam-repository#12738~]])

*** → Febusy 0.0.0

Febusy is a monadic-ish library to build dependency graphs between effectful computations while keeping track of their products, a.k.a. “build artifacts.”

One uses the module ~Febusy.Edsl~ to construct a direct acyclic graph of build
artifacts and then the function ~Febusy.Edsl.Make_unix.run~ to “run” the
incremental build. For now, the builds run sequentially but the build-artifacts
are still properly kept track of between runs with “state” files.

- Source: https://gitlab.com/smondet/febusy/
- Documentation: http://smondet.gitlab.io/febusy/.

Version 0.0.0 should be considered “alpha-preview stuff.”

(release PR: [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/12747][~ocaml/opam-repository#12747~]])

*** → ppx_deriving_cmdliner 0.4.1

The PPX ~ppx_deriving_cmdliner~ makes it easy to get a nice command line interface without really knowing much about ~Cmdliner~'s API.

It is a [[https://github.com/whitequark/ppx_deriving][ppx_deriving]] plugin that generates a [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner][Cmdliner]] ~'a Term~ for a given record type.

This release does not add any new feature, only build improvements (recent versions of OCaml, ~dune~-based build, …).

See https://github.com/hammerlab/ppx_deriving_cmdliner.

* BER MetaOCaml N107, for OCaml 4.07.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2018-10/msg00007.html

** Oleg announced


BER MetaOCaml N107 is a strict superset of OCaml 4.07.1 for ``writing
programs that generate programs''.  BER MetaOCaml adds to OCaml the
type of code values (denoting ``program code'', or future-stage
computations), and two basic constructs to build them:
quoting and splicing. The generated code can be printed, stored in a
file -- or compiled and linked-back to the running program, thus
implementing run-time code optimization. A well-typed BER MetaOCaml
program generates only well-scoped and well-typed programs:
The generated code shall compile without type errors.
Staging-annotation-free BER MetaOCaml is identical to
OCaml; BER MetaOCaml can link to any OCaml-compiled library (and
vice versa); findlib and other tools can be used with BER MetaOCaml as
they are, in their binary form.

BER MetaOCaml N107 is a superset of the just released OCaml 4.07.1.
It also has a number of small improvements: better error messages, no
longer needing parentheses when putting a sequence of statements in
brackets, more convenient genlet, etc.  It also has two notable
additions: explicit lifting and new offshoring.

Explicit lifting is the explicit conversion of a value to the code,
which, when compiled and run, (re-)produces that value.  BER N107 supports
explicit lifting of base-type values and lists, options, and, notably,
arrays of liftable values. Explicit lifting is described in Section
3.2.1 of the MetaOCaml book.

The generated code, if simple enough, can be `offshored' -- converted
to the intermediate, imperative language which may then be transcribed
to C, OpenCL, LLVM, etc. When generating computational kernels, the
code is supposed to be simple enough, so it runs fast. One test case
in MetaOCaml distribution shows how can one go about converting the
intermediate code to C. Offshoring thus lets us treat a subset of
OCaml as a new notation (syntax) for C.

BER MetaOCaml N107 should be available though OPAM, hopefully soon.
In the meanwhile, it is available as a set of patches to the
OCaml 4.07.1 distribution. \\
        http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/ber-metaocaml-107.tar.gz \\
See the INSTALL document in that archive. You need the source
distribution of OCaml 4.07.1.

For more explanations, please see \\
        http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html \\
as well as ChangeLog and NOTES.txt in the BER MetaOCaml distribution.
