*** DkML 2.0.3

Consider 2.0.3 to be a release candidate. The [installers and release notes are
here](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/releases/2.0.3).

The major bugfix solves Visual C++ Redistributables failing when a higher version is
already
installed.

The major change is that the "Bytecode Edition" installer is no longer being
released, due to the lack of users saying they would use it.

      <cwn_title>Blurhash 0.1.0 is out!</cwn_title>

      <cwn_who>anqou announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am pleased to announce the release of a new library Blurhash 0.1.0!

https://github.com/ushitora-anqou/ocaml-blurhash

This library implements an encoder for [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/) in OCaml.
BlurHash allows us to convert an image into a short string that represents a
lightweight, 'blurred' version of the input image. It can be used as a placeholder on
a Web page, for example.

The only function this library provides is ~Blurhash.blur_hash_for_pixels~, which
takes the same arguments as ~blurHashForPixels~ in [the C reference
implementation](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash/tree/master/C).

Although it does not depend on any image library, you can use (e.g.,) camlimages to
load an image from a file.

#+begin_src ocaml
let load_image_as_rgb24 ~path =
  match OImages.(load path [] |> tag) with
  | Rgb24 img -> img
  | Rgba32 img -> img#to_rgb24
  | Index8 img -> img#to_rgb24
  | Index16 img -> img#to_rgb24
  | Cmyk32 _ -> failwith "Not supported image type: Cmyk32"

let blurhash ~x_components ~y_components src =
  Blurhash.blur_hash_for_pixels ~x_components ~y_components ~width:src#width
    ~height:src#height ~bytes_per_row:(src#width * 3) src#dump

let test_encode_case1 () =
  let src = load_image_as_rgb24 ~path:"../../../test/test.ppm" in
  let hash = blurhash ~x_components:4 ~y_components:3 src in
  Alcotest.(check string) "test1" "LFE.@D9F01_2%L%MIVD*9Goe-;WB" hash;

      <cwn_title>SZXX v4 (and Eio)</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-szxx-v4-and-eio/13014/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Simon Grondin announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
[Github link](https://github.com/asemio/SZXX)

I've recently released v4 of SZXX and it's now built on Eio instead of Lwt.

It made me realize just how much complexity we've all accepted as the cost of doing
asynchronous IO.

The code was so thoroughly simplified thanks to Eio's non-monadic interface (no more
colored functions that infect everything with `'a Lwt.t`) and its concept of
[Switch](https://ocaml-multicore.github.io/eio/eio/Eio/Switch/index.html) that I was
able to implement complex features and optimizations that I had previously deemed too
costly in terms of development time and added complexity.

v4 is more than 3x faster, much easier to use correctly, and offers stronger memory
usage guarantees, all thanks to Eio.

SZXX is a *S*treaming *Z*IP, *X*ML and *X*LSX library.

It can stream data out of these 3 file formats even when reading from a network
socket, either in constant memory or with user-defined memory usage guarantees.

All 3 formats are quite "quirky" to say the least. XLSX (aka. OOXML) is infamous for
being difficult to stream. I could talk at length about all the different subspecies
of ZIP files!

Whenever giving up the non-seekability requirement (network streams, etc.) brings
benefits, SZXX offers *both* interfaces: an easier and/or more performant function
that may "jump" around a file, *and also* a more advanced non-seeking function.

Hundreds of hours of benchmarking,
[optimization](https://github.com/asemio/SZXX/blob/894f45c227404ebaede1b4918a8ad4f65c8a4732/src/parsing.ml)
and testing have gone into this latest release to squeeze out as much performance as
possible and I'm extremely pleased with the result.

I hope it proves useful to the OCaml ecosystem. Feel free to ask any questions about
SZXX, Eio, XLSX, ZIP, XML, etc.

      <cwn_title>LLVM 15 is out!</cwn_title>

      <cwn_what>
The [OCaml bindings to LLVM
15](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/llvm/llvm.15.0.7+nnp-2/) have been released on
opam!

This is a milestone in work contracted by the OCaml Software Foundation to ensure the
OCaml LLVM bindings remain up to date with both changes in OCaml and LLVM. First, I
would like to thank @jjb for supervising me, and @Kit-ty-kate and @Kakadu on GitHub
for their valuable help.

While previous versions of OCaml have supported naked pointers (pointers to outside
the OCaml heap as OCaml values), OCaml 5’s new multicore runtime disallows naked
pointers. Furthermore, OCaml 5 deprecated various runtime API functions. I had
previously written https://reviews.llvm.org/D136400 to adapt the LLVM bindings on the
main branch to these changes, but LLVM 15 had already been released by then, with
naked pointers in use. Therefore, I backported D136400 to LLVM 15 on [my
fork](https://github.com/alan-j-hu/llvm-project/tree/release/15.x+opam), and this
fork is what is published on opam. Therefore, the version of LLVM 15 on opam is
compatible with OCaml 5.

Furthermore, the LLVM IR has been migrating from pointers which carry the types of
their pointees to untyped “opaque pointers.” As a result, many LLVM API functions
have been deprecated and replaced. For example, ~build_call~ has been deprecated with
the replacement being ~build_call2~. I have added deprecation alerts to the relevant
functions and added missing bindings to construct opaque pointers.

The changes between the upstream LLVM 15 branch and the fork published on opam can be
viewed at
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/compare/release/15.x...alan-j-hu:llvm-project:aa44040b6096870d6bdecc7cc7c9e554f7b25a54.

Independently, @Kit-ty-kate had been working on building the LLVM bindings with Dune
instead of the in-tree OCamlfind-based system at
https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/llvm-dune. Her repo has a Git submodule that points to
my fork of LLVM, and her repo contains the Dune scaffolding that the LLVM 15 release
on opam uses. This change of build systems may have implications for selecting
between dynamic and static linking to LLVM:

- Prior opam releases of LLVM use OCamlfind, which is supported via the in-tree META file. The package had a script that installed versions of the bindings that link statically or dynamically to LLVM (if each was available) and patched the META file to use the ~llvm.static~ predicate to choose between them.
- The ~llvm.static~ predicate can be set using OCamlfind but cannot be set from Dune.
- The LLVM 15 release uses Dune, which it supports by running a script that generates Dune files in the source tree. The script's generated Dune files use the virtual library feature to define versions of the library that link statically or dynamically to LLVM (if each is available).
- OCamlfind-based packages don't understand the Dune virtual library feature and therefore cannot use the "default implementation" and must select the static or dynamic implementation explicitly.
- @kit-ty-kate believes that the package builds faster and is easier to maintain with Dune.

Further context:

and
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/using-output-of-ocamlfind-params-only-show-in-a-dune-build/4187.

In the process of preparing this release, @Kit-ty-kate and @Kakadu tested my changes
on their personal projects and helped uncover issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

      <cwn_title>OCaml 5.1.0 released</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-5-1-0-released/13021/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>octachron announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We have the pleasure of celebrating the anniversary of Olympe de Gouges'
"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen" by announcing the
release of OCaml version 5.1.0.

Some of the highlights in OCaml 5.1.0 are:

   - Many runtime performance regression and memory-leaks fixes
   (dynlinking, weak array, weak hash sets, GC with idle domains, GC prefetching)
   - Restored support for native code generation on RISC-V and s390x architectures
   - Restored Cygwin port
   - Reduced installation size (50% reduction)
   - Compressed compilation artefacts (.cmi, .cmt, .cmti, .cmo, .cma files)
   - 19 error message improvements
   - 14 standard library functions made tail-recursive with Tail-Recursion-Modulo-Cons (TRMC), such as ~List.append~ and ~List.map~
   - 57 new standard library functions
   - More examples in the standard library documentation
   - 42 bug fixes

OCaml 5.1.0 is still a relatively experimental release compared to the OCaml
4.14 branch. In particular:

   - The POWER port is being tested in the dev version of the compiler.
   - The Windows MSVC port is still unavailable.
   - Ephemeron performances need to be investigated.
   - GC compaction is a work in progress.
   - ~statmemprof~ is a work in progress.
   - There are a number of known runtime concurrency bugs (that trigger under
     rare circumstances).

We are planning to address those regressions, hopefully in time for the OCaml 5.2.0
release for some of them. Meanwhile, the OCaml 4.14 branch will be maintained, and
the next release on the OCaml 4.14 branch, OCaml 4.14.2, should follow this release
in the upcoming months.

Please report any unexpected behaviours on the [OCaml issue
tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues)
and post any questions or comments you might have on our
[discussion forums](https://discuss.ocaml.org).

The full list of changes can be found in the [changelog below](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-5-1-0-released/13021/2).

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0
#+end_src

The source code for the release candidate is also directly available on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0.tar.gz)
- [OCaml archives at Inria](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0.tar.gz)

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option
variant with:
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create &lt;switch_name&gt; ocaml-variants.5.1.0+options &lt;option_list&gt;
#+end_src
where ~&lt;option_list&gt;~ is a comma-separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For
instance, for a ~flambda~ and ~no-flat-float-array~ switch:
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 5.1.0+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0+options
ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_src

      <cwn_who>Daniel Bünzli announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Unicode 15.1.0 was released on September 12.

This is a point release for Unicode organisational reasons but it still adds 627 new
characters to the standard and a few rules were changed in the segmentation
standards. See the details on the [announcement page](https://blog.unicode.org/2023/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-151.html).

Accordingly the libraries mentioned at the end of this message had to be updated.
Consult the individual release notes for details. Both ~Uucd~ and ~Uucp~ are
incompatible releases sinces a block enumerant had to be added and some property
values changed their type. A few new properties related to identifiers, CJK and Indic
breaking are also added, see the ~Uucp~ release notes for details.

As mentioned last year all the libraries and sample code have been changed to use the
UTF decoders of the standard library rather than rely on the ~uutf~ package.

This has the following impact:

1. These new versions are only available for OCaml >= 4.14.0
2. The library name ~uunf.string~ is deprecated. The ~Uunf_string~
   module is now simply part of the ~uunf~ library.
3. The library name ~uuseg.string~ is deprecated. The ~Uuseg_string~ module
   is now simply part of the ~uuseg~ library.

Regarding point 2. and 3. the libraries still exist but generate an ~ocamlfind~
warning if they are used. They are empty and simply require the base library. They
will be fully removed at some point.

Two other less visible changes are:

 * After waiting for too long if intra module link time dead code elimination would maybe make it in the compiler, ~Uucp~ was finally changed to use module aliases. This means that only the data modules you use get linked in your programs.

 * Also after much reluctance, the repos now track generated data files for better source traceability, sandboxed pinning, and make it easier to dig them out when their data generation strategy breaks the compiler.

A big thanks for funding from the [OCaml Software Foundation](http://ocaml-sf.org/) and from my [donators](https://github.com/sponsors/dbuenzli).

I welcome and thank the new donator [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/).

      <cwn_what>
Hello everyone! First time poster and ocaml contributor here, I just release a
library named "safemoney" which is intended to uphold type safety and enforce
lossless operations for various kind of currency manipulations and offers convenient
api for users. I started learning ocaml about 2 months ago so it was a great learning
experience for me making this library and I must say I absolutely fell in love with
ocaml and really think this is the best abstraction for writing elegant, functional
and performant software, like rust + haskell supercharged but better ;) really glad I
found this community and everyone seems very helpful and kind indeed.

You can find further info here:

- source code: https://github.com/gborough/safemoney
- documentation: https://gborough.github.io/safemoney/safemoney/safemoney/index.html

Please do forgive me for mucking up the documentation at this moment as I am still
trying to figure out the quirks with writing and publishing docs, will fix it soon to
the best of my ability. I used dune-release for publishing to gh-pages and seems like
a quite a manual process, if you know a better way then please do let me know.

Thank you and have a lovely weekend!

I'm pleased to announce the release of ppx_optint.0.2.0, a small ppx for
[optint](https://github.com/mirage/optint) literals. Instead of writing
~Optint.minus_one~ or ~Optint.Int63.minus_one~ you can write ~-1i~ or ~-1I~
respectively. It may be handy if you write code with a lot of optint literals.

Version 0.2.0 tries to be smarter and will use ~Optint.of_unsigned_int32~ and
~Optint.Int63.of_unsigned_int~ over ~_.of_string~ when possible.

*** DkML Install API 0.5.1

This was newly released today. It has some backwards-incompatible changes which
necessitated bumping to 0.5.x:
- Only register desired components. Previously all the components in the ~ocamlfind~ universe (ex. opam switch) were registered. Now only chosen components and their dependencies are registered.
- Add install/uninstall dependencies to META of each component opam package. For now this is duplicative with Component Registry, but gives access component graph purely with ~ocamlfind~ so can be used at code generation time.

And there is one bugfix:
- Print both error message and backtrace, not just backtrace.

DkML Install API 0.5.1 was the version used to create the [DkML 2.0.3 Windows
installer](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/releases/2.0.3) thanks to the
financial support of the [OCaml Software Foundation](https://ocaml-sf.org/).

      <cwn_who>jbeckford announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
DkML Workflows are GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD and desktop scripts. Version 2.0.3 is
[available today by clicking
here](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows). Who is this for?
- If you want to compile *and distribute* binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS, then the ~compilers~ workflows may be a good choice for you.
- If you are a /package maintainer/ and want to test that your package compiles with Visual Studio /MSVC/, the Windows ~compilers~ workflow is a good choice.

I personally use the
[setup-ocaml](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml) GitHub Action for
testing OCaml code, and /additionally/ use DkML Workflows to distribute binaries in
my own software like the [Windows/Linux/macOS diskuvbox
binaries](https://github.com/diskuv/diskuvbox/releases).

The problems I was trying to solve:
- It has to work with MSVC. It is really easy to distribute binaries on Windows if you use MSVC.
- I grew really really tired of debugging issues remotely in vendor locked GitHub Actions. GitLab CI/CD is not as bad but still not good. I needed the ability to easily run the CI/CD directly on PCs.
- I am not a fan of static linking. IMHO, static linking is an overly complex solution in search of a problem that is only present on Linux (probably due to the [600+ Linux distributions](https://truelist.co/blog/linux-statistics/)). And among other things it complicates security. But ...
- I /do/ like static linking's "easy to deploy" feature: you can static link an executable on your Linux desktop and ~scp~ to a Linux server. (See "Changes" below)
- I wanted to generate Apple Silicon binaries on Apple x86_64 CI/CD hardware.

*Changes with 2.0.3*:
- Finally implemented the "easy to deploy" feature. Now the steps for a working CI/CD pipeline are just: 1) edit ~.gitignore~, 2) edit ~.gitattributes~ and 3) copy-and-paste into your terminal.
- Make use of the standardized, upgradable ~./dk~ script to do all the fetching and creation of scripts.

/Nomenclature: DkML Workflows is a part of DkML, helps to maintain the Windows ecosystem, and has been supported financially by the OCaml Software Foundataion, but is separate from the DkML Installer many people are aware of. I'll try to distinguish them going forward./

Here is a feature comparison:

| GitHub Local Action                  | GitHub Marketplace Action | ~compilers~ uses local scripts to implement the GitHub build logic, while ~setup-ocaml~ is distributed through GitHub Marketplace which is easier to use |
| GitLab CI/CD Local Include           | /not supported/           | ~compilers~ supports GitLab CI/CD |
| Personal Computer Scripts            | /not supported/           | ~compilers~ can generates scripts to simulate CI on your personal computer for troubleshooting |
| MSVC + MSYS2                         | GCC + Cygwin              | On Windows ~compilers~ can let your native code use ordinary Windows libraries without ABI conflicts. You can also distribute your executables without the license headache of redistributing or statically linking ~libgcc_s_seh~ and ~libstdc++~ |
| dkml-base-compiler                   | ocaml-base-compiler       | On macOS, ~compilers~ cross-compiles to ARM64 with ~dune -x darwin_arm64~ |
| CentOS 7 and Linux distros from 2014 | Latest Ubuntu             | On Linux, ~compilers~ builds with an old GLIBC. ~compilers~ dynamically linked Linux executables will be highly portable as GLIBC compatibility issues should be rare, and compatible with the unmodified LGPL license used by common OCaml dependencies like [GNU MP](https://gmplib.org/manual/Copying) |
| 1 yrs                                | 4 yrs                     | ~setup-ocaml~ is officially supported and well-tested. |
| Some pinned packages                 | No packages pinned        | ~compilers~, for some packages, must pin the version so that cross-platform patches (especially for Windows) are available. With ~setup-ocaml~ you are free to use any version of any package |
| diskuv/diskuv-opam-repository        | fdopen/opam-repository    | Custom patches for Windows are sometimes needed. ~compilers~ uses a much smaller set of patches. ~setup-ocaml~ uses a large but deprecated set of patches. |
