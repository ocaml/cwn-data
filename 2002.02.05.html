1) otags-3.04.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Francois Monin announced:

New version of otags, with better handling of classes
and mutual recursive types.

Thanks : Hendrik Tews

<a href="http://www.multimania.com/moninjf/Ocaml/otags-3.04.3.tar.gz">http://www.multimania.com/moninjf/Ocaml/otags-3.04.3.tar.gz</a>

See HISTORY, README and -help for details.

---- from README ---------

otags is used to build TAGS tables for emacs, like etags does, but for
Ocaml code source files. It is based on camlp4 parsers of caml, which
makes it more accurate than versions based on regexps : otags finds
references to constructors of sum types, fields of records, etc.

2) IoXML - OCaml from/to XML
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel de Rauglaudre announced:

Hi,

I have the pleasure to announce the first release of IoXML.

IoXML is a syntax extension (using Camlp4) which automatically add XML
parsers and printers to all types you define in your mli and ml files.

It is like input_value/output_value for your data, but in XML instead
of binary. The dumped data is tagged by the constructor names and the
record and labels names.

Main page and distribution here:

3) IoXML goes on...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel de Rauglaudre then added:

Hi all,

I just released version 0.4 of IoXML. See the file CHANGES to see what
happened this week-end:
   <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/IoXML/">http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/IoXML/</a>

  ---

 IoXML is a Camlp4 syntax extension for OCaml mli and ml files which
 generates XML parsers and printers for all types you define. It offers
 a kind of input_value/output_value but in XML instead of binary.
 Useful to export your data to other programs, or to save it, to debug
 by traces, to be fashionable, and so on...

4) ocamlnet-0.92 has been released
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerd Stolpmann announced:

Hi,

The ocamlnet project releases a new version of its library, the successor of
the well-known netstring library. This release mainly focuses on smoothing
the interoperation of its modules, especially by using the concept of
channel objects everywhere. There are also a number of new features, see
below.

Ocamlnet has now a rich set of functions for the following tasks:

- Dealing with stacks of channel transformers, e.g. "read a certain section
  of a file and decode the BASE64 strings, and then convert everything
  to UTF-8". This can usually be done without allocating large buffers,
  but by processing the data block by block.
  (NEW)

- Separate a channel into sections, and process the sections independently.
  For example, one can define a boundary string, and read a file section
  by section.
  (NEW)

- Encode and decode strings, convert between character sets.
  (The character set conversion needs to be revised.)

- Parse and print date strings

- Parse and print HTML text

- Parse and print MIME mail messages. There are now high-level functions
  for manipulating mail messages (NEW)

- Compose mail messages and send them (using sendmail). The message
  composer creates MIME messages, too, and can deal with arbitrary
  character sets.
  (NEW)

- Parse and print URLs (This module is not yet up to date)

- Ocamlnet includes a complete and modularized implementation of the CGI
  protocol.
  (UPDATED)

- Ocamlnet has experimental support for building application servers
  with Apache and the Jserv protocol
  (NEW)

- Ocamlnet includes an experimental POP3 client

The library has been rewritten such that many functions accept so-called
netchannels (or channel objects) as input/output media. The idea is very
simple: a netchannel either represents a real channel, a buffer, a string,
a lexer buffer, a filter (or some of the more complicated entities). A
netchannel for input has methods for reading from the channel, for example

let line = ch # input_line()

to read the next line, and an output netchannel provides the usual output
methods, like

ch # output_string "xyz"

to output a string to the netchannel. The same type is used no matter
what kind of thing the netchannel really is:

let ch1 = new output_channel stdout ;;

let buf = Buffer.create 100 ;;
let ch2 = new output_buffer buf ;;

Here, ch1 is a netchannel on top of O'Caml's built-in out_channel, and
ch2 is on top of a buffer. Ocamlnet contains many functions that can be
applied to any kind of netchannel, for example

write_mime_message msg ch1 msg    (* write msg to stdout *)
write_mime_message msg ch2 msg    (* write msg to the buffer buf *)

This helps a lot because it saves the programmer from providing the
same functionality for various data types.

A more complicated netchannel is

let ch3 = new output_filter (new Base64.encoding_pipe()) ch2 ;;

Any output to ch3 is BASE64-encoded and transferred to ch2. The netchannels
can be stacked without any restriction, and if the stack is not too high,
the performance loss is quite minimal. For instance, the BASE64 encoding
is applied block by block, so that the additional costs for method lookups
must only be paid for a whole block, not for a single byte.

Another interesting means of programming are the so-called netstreams.
These are input channels with look-ahead, i.e. you can look at the
bytes you will read in the future. The look-ahead buffer can by enlarged
as needed. It is possible to form substreams of netstreams, in order to
view only a certain section of the whole stream. The substream will return
EOF where the section ends, but the main stream can of course read beyond
the section boundary. (See Netstream.) Again, it is possible to recursively
apply substreaming to itself. An application is the parser for nested
multipart MIME messages.

Netchannels and netstreams are two examples illustrating the current
direction of Ocamlnet development. We are trying to find out the basic
types that are needed everywhere, and that make up the glue between
the various parts of the library.

And before I forget it the second time: Ocamlnet includes a routine to
translate Str regular expressions to Pcre regular expressions (because
we are only using Pcre now).

5) OCamlCVS 1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maxence Guesdon announced:

Hi all,

a new release (1.1) of OCamlCVS is available.
Changes are :
- a merge assistant added, to resolve merge conflicts with your magic mouse
- the configure script now checks the ocaml version
  (thanks to Alain Frisch for pointing this out :-)
- a bug fix, causing ocamlcvs to find no file when using a remote cvs server

OCamlCVS can be found at
<a href="http://www.maxence-g.net/Tools/ocamlcvs/ocamlcvs.html">http://www.maxence-g.net/Tools/ocamlcvs/ocamlcvs.html</a>

Enjoy !

[You can use this new version in Cameleon, just compile ocamlcvs, install,
then re-compile Cameleon.]

6) OCamlAgrep 1.0 (string searching with errors)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Xavier Leroy announced:

It is my pleasure to release the OCamlAgrep library:

     ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/bazar-ocaml/ocamlagrep-1.0.tar.gz

This library implements the Wu-Manber algorithm for string searching
with errors, popularized by the "agrep" Unix command and the "glimpse"
file indexing tool.  It was developed as part of a search engine for a
largish MP3 collection; the "with error" searching comes handy for those
who can't spell Liszt or Shostakovitch.

Given a search pattern and a string, this algorithm determines whether
the string contains a substring that matches the pattern up to a
parameterizable number N of "errors".  An "error" is either a
substitution (replace a character of the string with another
character), a deletion (remove a character) or an insertion (add a
character to the string).  In more scientific terms, the number of
errors is the Levenshtein edit distance between the pattern and the
matched substring.

The search patterns are roughly those of the Unix shell, including
one-character wildcard (?), character classes ([0-9]) and multi-character
wildcard (*).  In addition, conjunction (&) and alternative (|) are
supported.  General regular expressions are not supported, however.

Performance is quite good: for short patterns (less than 31 characters)
and no errors, this library is about 8 times faster than OCaml's "Str"
regular expression library.  Speed decreases with the number of errors
allowed, but even with 3 errors we are still faster than "Str".

The algorithm is described in S. Wu and U. Manber, "Fast Text
Searching With Errors", tech. rep. TR 91-11, University of Arizona, 1991.
It's a nice exercise in dynamic programming and bit-parallel implementation.
