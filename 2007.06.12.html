Following on from our "why not fork" discussion, here is my most elegant 
concurrent ray tracer written in vanilla OCaml. 

This program simply runs four processes (forking off three) in parallel to 
improve performance when 2-4 CPUs are available (increase "d" if you have &gt;4 
CPUs). 

This isn't as sophisticated as the JoCaml version but it does double 
performance (taking the time down from 4s to 2s) on my dual-core machine, 
making it faster than any language that uses a concurrent GC. I don't know 
about you guys, but this is a complete revelation for me! 

I believe the performance relies upon the Linux kernel lazily copying the 
process. Does OSX also do that? 

Anyway, here is the code: 

let delta = sqrt epsilon_float 

type vec = {x:float; y:float; z:float} 
let ( *| ) s r = {x = s *. r.x; y = s *. r.y; z = s *. r.z}

let ( -| ) a b = {x = a.x -. b.x; y = a.y -. b.y; z = a.z -. b.z} 
let dot a b = a.x *. b.x +. a.y *. b.y +. a.z *. b.z 
let length r = sqrt(dot r r) 
let unitise r = 1. /. length r *| r 

type scene = 
    Sphere of vec * float 
  | Group of vec * float * scene * scene * scene * scene * scene 

let ray_sphere {x=dx; y=dy; z=dz} {x=vx; y=vy; z=vz} r = 
  let disc = vx *. vx +. vy *. vy +. vz *. vz -. r *. r in 
  if disc &lt; 0. then infinity else 
    let b = vx *. dx +. vy *. dy +. vz *. dz in 
    let b2 = b *. b in 
    if b2 &lt; disc then infinity else 
      let disc = sqrt(b2 -. disc) in 
      let t1 = b -. disc in 
      if t1 &gt; 0. then t1 else b +. disc 

let ray_sphere' {x=ox; y=oy; z=oz} {x=dx; y=dy; z=dz} {x=cx; y=cy; z=cz} r = 
  let vx = cx -. ox and vy = cy -. oy and vz = cz -. oz in

  let b = vx *. dx +. vy *. dy +. vz *. dz in

      let f s = intersect' orig dir s in 
      ray_sphere' orig dir center radius &amp;&amp; (f a || f b || f c || f d || f e)

&gt; I must have missed the JoCaml version. Where is it? 

  <a href="http://jocaml.inria.fr/#examples">http://jocaml.inria.fr/#examples</a> 
There is also a JoCaml mailing list for JoCaml-related ramblings, and it could 
do with more rambling. ;-)

It is my pleasure to anounce a new JoCaml example,
<a href="http://jocaml.inria.fr/#examples">http://jocaml.inria.fr/#examples</a>

  The example is a distributed version of a ray tracer written
as en entry at the ICFP Programming contest.

  This is another example of the fork/exec technique
(here used twice, for forking computing clients and spies
that open a graphical window to display the images as they are
computed.)

  This is also an example of non-obvious synchronisations written
  in JoCaml. Two points are worth a few words:

    * When a remote agent dies, its share of work is given to someone else
      [easy]

    * At the end of an image, tasks that are not yet done, are given
      to other remote agents (if any). This avoids the situation
      where everyone is waiting for the slowest agent to complete.
      (try ^Z on one of the remote agent...)

  Of course, this is not production code, but it apparently works...



** JoCamls 'R Us: A not so simple ray tracer in JoCaml **


  This program is an example of making a pre-existing OCaml  program
  distributed thanks to JoCaml. It is intended to illustrate the
  'distributed loop' idiom of JoCaml in a realistic context.
  Information on JoCaml is available at <a href="http://jocaml.inria.fr/">http://jocaml.inria.fr/</a>

  The pre-existing program is the ray tracer written by the
  Camls 'R Us team at the ICFP 2000 programming contest.
  The scenes are described using a rather sophisticated language described
  on the contest page <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/</a>

  We all know that ray tracers are 'concurrent by nature', but some
  interesting issues remain: such as load balance, management of
  failures... Those points are handled in files renderServer.ml
  and renderClient.ml

The new version of ODT has been released this morning. This version replaces 
the broken ODT 1.1 release. 
The 1.1 UI plugin was built incomplete because I forgot to update the plugin 
build script: the UI plugin did not contain the indentation configuration 
files. 

Now, ODT works as expected. It supports execution via the Java 1.5 JVM and, 
most of all, automatic indentation. 

Everything is available on the ODT website: <a href="http://ocamldt.free.fr">http://ocamldt.free.fr</a>. 
The "overview" page explains its current main features, and the 
"install notes" page details some requirements and incompatibilities 
with older versions of OCaml. 
Some screenshots are also available to show the GUI. 

Please, don't hesitate to try ODT (for personal or professional use) 
and forward this mail to anyone which could be interested in.

At <a href="http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc/">http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc/</a> you will find CPU load monitor 
written in OCaml (sans some C glue). 

New things since last announcement include: 

The site was updated with a bit more sane documentation along with 
few links to Linux kernel mailing list discussions on the subject that 
would explain why sometimes native accounting can not be trusted (since 
2.6.21 you can find a summary in Documentation/cpu-load.txt) There's 
also a small test application that showcases the problem. 

Ports to: 
  Windows NT 
  Mac OS X (only UP/PPC tested) 
  Solaris (only X86 tested). 

While Solaris' CPU accounting seems accurate the same can not be said 
about Mac OS X and NT. With a help of third party application one can 
even begin to trust the accounting on NT (consult README.windows). So 
Mac OS X is in the most dire state at the moment. I'd imagine that 
writing XNU/X86 kernel extension to do more or less what's done under 
NT/X86 would be rather easy (alas i don't have access to this kind of 
system), XNU/PPC it seems would require completely different approach. 

Any help with NT, XNU would be greatly appreciated.
