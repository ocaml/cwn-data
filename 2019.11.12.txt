Mirage 3.7.1 released
═════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/mirage-3-7-1-released/4634/1>


Hannes Mehnert announced
────────────────────────

  MirageOS 3.7.1 is released to opam repository now.

  Breaking change:
  • The hooks previously defined in
    OS.Main.at_enter/at_enter_iter/at_exit/at_exit_iter are now part of
    Mirage_runtime (only used by mirage-entropy)
    <https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/1010>

  Behaviour changes of MirageOS unikernels:
  • A unikernel now always calls the Mirage_runtime.at_exit registered
    hooks – once a unikernel succesfully executed its `start' in
    `Lwt_main.run', `exit 0' is called to ensure this behaviour
    <https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/1011>
  • Top-level exceptions are no longer caught (there used to be in
    mirage-unix/mirage-xen/mirage-solo5 custom handlers). The OCaml
    runtime prints the exception and backtrace on stdout and calls exit
    2 (from 4.10.0, abort() will be called).

  Deprecations (being removed from Mirage 4.0)
  • All Mirage_YYY_lwt are deprecated, Mirage_YYY interfaces are no
    longer astracted over 'a io and buffer. This reduces the amount of
    opam packages - mirage-yyy-lwt are no longer part of the release
    (each mirage-yyy package provides a Mirage_yyy_lwt module for
    backwards compatibility). Motivation was discussed in
    <https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1004>
  • mirage-types and mirage-types-lwt are deprecated, please use the
    Mirage_YYY signatures directly instead.

  Other observable changes
  • `mirage configure' now deletes all exising opam files

  Most reverse dependencies are already released to opam, have a look at
  <https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1012> for progress (and the
  temporary <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev.git#easy> opam
  overlay).
