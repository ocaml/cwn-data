for an example you can have a look at a binding [1] of the Irrlicht 3d
engine (for the record my fork [2] currently has a small addition) or a
binding [3] I started (but never got very far) of the Ogre3D library. The
latter shows how to put the C++ files in a subdirectory, which was not that
easy to obtain.

HTH,
  Philippe.

One also needs to link with stdc++
The following should work

  CCopt: -g -x c++ -O2 -Wextra -Wstrict-overflow=5 -fno-strict-aliasing -Wfatal-errors
  CClib: -lstdc++

Just a brief reminder that I'd still like feedback on the OCaml logo and
ocaml.org redesign work (see previous message below).

I'm continuing the discussion on the infrastructure list [1] about the
redesign and how we migrate the current site to the new design. If anyone
would like to join in please do so over there.

3) QCheck 0.1
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-10/msg00058.html>

** Simon Cruanes announced:

I'm happy to announce the first release of a small QuickCheck
implementation for OCaml, named `QCheck`. It consists in writing
invariants as function t -> bool for some type t, and then checking that
the invariant holds on randomly generated instances of t.

QCheck is designed so that writing tests is as easy as possible[1],
especially for Arbitrary instances (the part where you generate random
values of a type) where it provides many combinators.

The library requires OCaml >= 4.00.1, and is available under the BSD
license on opam via:

    $ opam install qcheck

You can find documentation at:

source code at:
