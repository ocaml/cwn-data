IndiscriminateCoding asked
──────────────────────────

  Is there any production-ready implementation of [Raft consensus
  protocol] in OCaml?  There is [ocaml-raft], which does have a
  technical paper, but it looks abandoned and it's not even in opam
  repository.

  Thanks! First project seems abandoned too (and doesn't have license
  specified), but second looks promising. Will have a closer look at it.

Andrew Tongen announced
───────────────────────

  As a learning project, I decided to implement the game of [Set]
  entirely in ocaml/reason:

  Game: [https://setml.andrewtongen.net/]
  Code: [https://github.com/atongen/setml]

  There are separate modules for frontend and backend code, with shared
  modules in between. Overall, I really enjoyed this exercise. The ocaml
  type system is truly amazing, and I will definitely look for more ways
  to use it in the future.

  The game itself has not be thoroughly tested on various devices, but
  it seems to work pretty well on newish android and apple devices.

  Check it out and let me know what you think!

Deep into this thread, Brendan Long announced

  I've been super busy for a while, but here's the blog post:

  (And the code I was working on when I wrote this will show up in our
  Mssql library as soon as I have time)
