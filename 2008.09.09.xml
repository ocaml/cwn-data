We're happy to announce a new version of the API documentation, available at
&lt;https://forge.ocamlcore.org/docman/index.php?group_id=17&amp;amp;selected_doc_group_id=49&amp;amp;language_id=1&gt;.
It's still a preview, but a much more readable one than what we had provided
so far.

			<cwn_title>OCamlSpotter: OCaml compiler extension for source browsing</cwn_title>

I have written a small compiler patch called ocamlspotter. It extends
-annot option and records all the variable definition locations, so
that we can jump from variable uses to their definitions easily from
editors such as emacs.

It is still in a beta version quality, but it is already very useful
to browse very complex ocaml project trees.

The source is available as a diff against a cvs version of OCaml compiler at:

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
