      <cwn_title>wasicaml - a code emitter for OCaml targeting WebAssembly</cwn_title>

      <cwn_who>Gerd Stolpmann announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'd like to announce a new project to develop a code generator that emits
WebAssembly:

https://github.com/remixlabs/wasicaml

With the support of RemixLabs I could already create a very first version
that takes the OCaml bytecode as input and translates it to WebAssembly.
While this approach probably doesn't lead to the fastest code, it is
easy to accomplish, and it demonstrates the challenge (and already shows how
to solve many of the part problems along the road).

To be precisely, the target of the translator is wasm32-unknown-wasi, i.e.
the WASI ABI. This ABI is still in early development, but provides already
the syscalls (or better, host calls) to access files, to get the current
time, and to read the environment. This is almost enough to run a compiler -
I only had to add system() so that ocamlc can start external preprocessors.
Also, due to the fact that the current wasm implementations still lack
exception handling, I had to assume the presence of a host emulation of
exceptions (which is easy to provide if the host environment is Javascript,
but not necessarily for other environments).

The translator takes the OCaml bytecode as input, i.e. you first create
an excecutable

#+begin_example
$ ocamlc -o myexec ...
#+end_example

and then make wasm out of it:

#+begin_example
$ wasicaml -o myexec.wasm myexec
#+end_example

If you omit the .wasm suffix, wasicaml will put a preamble in front of the
wasm code that starts the execution:

#+begin_example
$ wasicaml -o myexec_wasm myexec
$ ./myexec_wasm
#+end_example

Because of this trick, many problems of cross-compiling can be avoided.

You may ask what the benefits of yet another "Web" language are. We already
have two emitters targeting Javascript - isn't that enough? Well, two
answers here.

First, WASI is a proper LLVM target. Because of this, you can link
code from other languages with your executable (e.g. C or Rust). So
you are not limited to OCaml but can use any language that also targets
the WASI ABI. E.g. you can do

#+begin_example
$ wasicaml -o myexec.wasm myexec -ccopt -lfoo
#+end_example

to also link in libfoo.a (which must also be compiled to wasm). So
it is multi-lingual from the beginning.

Second, WebAssembly can be used outside the web, too. WASI targets more
the command-line, and server plugins, and generally any OS-independent
environments. For example, imagine you have an Electron app with a
great UI, but for some special functionality you need to include some
OCaml code, too. You don't want to give up the OS-independence, and
WASI gives you now a natural option to add the OCaml code. And you still
have access to the filesystem without hassle. - Another example is edge
computing, i.e. when the cloud is extended by computers outside the data
center, and the code should be in a form so that it can be run on as many
platforms as possible. - All in all, WASI plays well when you need to
combine OS-independence with a classic way of organizing the code as
command or as server function, and you also need predictable performance.

The challenge of translating OCaml to wasm is mainly the garbage collector.
Wasm doesn't permit many of the tricks ocamlopt is using to know in which
memory (or register) locations OCaml values are stored. In wasm, there are
no registers but the closest vehicle are local variables. Now, it is not
possible to scan these variables from the GC function, making it practically
impossible to put OCaml values there while a function is called that might
trigger a GC. There is also no really cheap way of obtaining a stack
descriptor.

Wasicaml inherits the stack from the bytecode interpreter and uses it as
its own shadow stack for OCaml values. As wasicaml bases on the bytecode
representation of the code, the bytecode instructions already ensure that
values always live in this stack when the GC might run. Wasicaml additionally
tries to identify values that don't need this special treatment (like ints
and bools) and that are preferably stored in local variables, giving the
wasm executor freedom to put these into registers or other high-speed
locations. (Unfortunately, most of the type information is already erased
in the bytecode, and this is definitely one of the deficiencies of the
bytecode approach.)

In order to maximize the performance, it is probably best to avoid the
stack whenever possible. The current approach of transforming the bytecode
hasn't brought to an end yet with respect to such optimizations. For
example, there could be more analyses that figure out when GC runs are
actually possible and when it is safe to use local variables.

Another problem of the bytecode basis is that all function calls are
indirect, preventing the wasm executor from inlining functions.

As a project, I'd like to see wasicaml progressing in two directions.
First, make the current approach as good as possible - although basing
it on the bytecode representation has its downsides, it is easy to understand
and it is possible to figure out what the necessary ingredients for fast
code are. Second, get an idea where a possible real wasm backend
would fit into the OCaml compiler (maybe it is c-- but maybe this doesn't
give us much and you start better with lambda).

Anyway, welcome to the new world of WebAssembly!

      <cwn_title>opam 2.1.0~rc2</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-2-1-0-rc2/8042/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>David Allsopp announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The opam team has great pleasure in announcing opam 2.1.0~rc2!

The focus since beta4 has been preparing for a world with more than one released version of opam (i.e.
2.0.x and 2.1.x). The release candidate extends CLI versioning further and, under the hood, includes a
big change to the opam root format which allows new versions of opam to indicate that the root may
still be read by older versions of the opam libraries. A plugin compiled against the 2.0.9 opam
libraries will therefore be able to read information about an opam 2.1 root (plugins and tools compiled
against 2.0.8 are unable to load opam 2.1.0 roots).

Please do take this release candidate for a spin! It is available in the Docker images at ocaml/opam on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam/tags) as the opam-2.1 command (or you can ~sudo ln -f
/usr/bin/opam-2.1 /usr/bin/opam~ in your ~Dockerfile~ to switch to it permanently). The release
candidate can also be tested via our installation script (see the
[wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/How-to-test-an-opam-feature#from-a-tagged-release-including-pre-releases)
for more information).

Thank you to anyone who noticed the unannounced first release candidate and tried it out. Between
tagging and what would have been announcing it, we discovered an issue with upgrading local switches
from earlier alpha/beta releases, and so fixed that for this second release candidate.

Assuming no showstoppers, we plan to release opam 2.1.0 next week. The improvements made in 2.1.0 will
allow for a much faster release cycle, and we look forward to posting about the 2.2.0 plans soon!

I've put together some simple [ocaml-arrow](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-arrow) library. It
works reasonably well and is quite battle tested but definitely needs a bit of cleanup as the bits
under src/ are deprecated in favor of the ones under c_api/. There is also a ppx to automatically
convert ocaml records to/from arrow. Some examples using this can be seen in the [tests
directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-arrow/blob/master/c_api/tests/ppx.ml).

If there is some interest, I can certainly push up on cleaning this and make an actual opam package.

We are developing a compiler for a no-code platform that translates our DSL to bytecode and/or
WebAssembly. The language is largely of functional type but is also able to manage state with a
spreadsheet model, allowing reactive programming without having to resort to libraries. The language is
statically typed using a Hindley-Milner type checker. The compiler is primarily written in OCaml. Other
languages of our platform are Go, C, Elm, and Javascript.

We are looking for a compiler engineer with skills in code generation for WebAssembly:

- Translation of an intermediate representation to WebAssembly
- Writing runtimes and SDKs targeting WebAssembly
- Code optimization

      <cwn_title>v3.0.0 release of reparse, reparse-lwt, reparse-lwt-unix</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-v3-0-0-release-of-reparse-reparse-lwt-reparse-lwt-unix/8058/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Bikal Lem announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am happy to announce v3.0.0 of ~reparse~ - an OCaml library for constructing various types of parsers
in OCaml.

The release follows a complete overhaul of the internal working of the library to achieve the following
goals:

1. Allow construction of efficient, zero-copy parsers. See [String parser for example](https://github.com/lemaetech/reparse/blob/master/lib/reparse.mli#L1237). The library provides a [Make functor](https://github.com/lemaetech/reparse/blob/master/lib/reparse.mli#L1230) parametrised over a ~Promise~ and a ~Input~ type allowing you control over both parser memory allocation and copying.

2. Support usage of async libraries - lwt and async. Following the first point the library can now be used together with ~lwt~ and/or ~async~. A lwt parse - for example - can now be used seamlessly with your other lwt code. The integration is seamless.

3.  Provide ~Make_buffered~ functor to produce parsers where the input type natively doesn't allow random read, for example sockets, lwt streams and channels. There is now two new supporting packages ~reparse-lwt~ which provides parsing from ~char Lwt_stream.t~ input type and ~reparse-lwt-unix~ which provides parsing from ~Lwt_unix.file_descr~ and ~Lwt_unix.input_channel' respectively.

4. Provide ~Make_unbuffered~ functor to produce parsers where the input type natively supports random read, for example strings, bigstrings, bytes.

5. Introduce function ~unsafe_any_char~ to allow efficient (zero-copy?) parsing.

6. Prune dependencies by removing ~base~.

P.S. The documentation is bit behind in this release so please bear with me while work through the
issues in the coming days.

I'm pleased to announce the 0.2.0 release of [~Progress~](https://github.com/craigfe/progress), now
available via Opam.

https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/ocaml/original/2X/7/727d878b6d17f3c48e6946f4df424bcc59938da3.png

~Progress~ is an OCaml library for defining and using progress bars. It has the following features:

- allows user-defined progress bar layouts;
- supports rendering multiple progress bars simultaneously;
- dynamically responds to changes in terminal size;
- supports interleaving logging with progress bar rendering.

This second release contains a much-improved DSL for specifying progress bars, alongside improvements
and extensions  to the rendering logic. The bars in the screenshot above are defined as follows:

#+begin_src ocaml
let bar ~color ~total =
  let open Progress.Line in
  list
    [ spinner ~color:(Progress.Color.ansi ~green) ()
    ; brackets (elapsed ())
    ; bar ~color total
    ; bytes
    ; parens (const "eta: " ++ eta total)
    ]
#+end_src

It also comes with more complete
[documentation](https://craigfe.github.io/progress/progress/Progress/index.html) and many more
[examples](https://github.com/CraigFe/progress/tree/main/examples), including:

- a Cargo-like progress bar w/ logging of intermediate results:

The changelog is [here](https://github.com/CraigFe/progress/blob/0.2.0/CHANGES.md#020-2021-06-26) and
the API  documentation is [here](https://craigfe.github.io/progress/progress/Progress/index.html). The
library is not yet feature-complete, but should still be reasonably useful :-) Happy hacking!
