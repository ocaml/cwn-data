I think you can try taking a look at two project: 
<http://www.galaxquery.org/> 
<http://www.cduce.org/ocaml> 

I think they implement something close to what you want (I mean "close", 
not "what you want" unfortunately). At least there is some code in it, 
that deal with xsd.
			
** Richard Jones also replied:

XSD as in the crazy-complicated quasi-standard used in SOAP, WSDL etc? 
I'm not sure you'll find any implementations in OCaml - it's hard 
enough to implement when you have a large team of people available to 
you. 

I did a very very partial implementation using CDuce as part of my 
SOAP client code for the Google AdWords API.  It's not directly 
usable, but maybe you can have a look at it for inspiration anyway:

2) findlib-1.2.4 (for ocaml-3.11)

** Gerd Stolpmann announced:

I've just uploaded findlib-1.2.4. This is a bugfix release:

     * For ocaml-3.11 some camlp4 libs no longer include dynlink.
       Findlib has a fixed META definition.
     * Bigarray needs unix: This has been fixed in the META file, too.
     * Attempt to fix some "space path" issues for Win32. It is
       untested, however.

Get findlib from its homepage
(<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html>). The GODI package
is already updated.

Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'<1':1
zM
If you know of a better way, please let me know.
