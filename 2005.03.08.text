Threads are the natural way to do this.
This is already possible with GlGtk, using lablgtk -thread.
If you want to do this with glut, I see two possible approaches:
* Run the glut main loop in a different thread, and have it exit every
  100ms so you can yield and run the toplevel thread during this time
  (this is basically the way this is done in lablgtk)
  This is safe, but supposes there is an easy way to exit and reenter
  the main loop frequently.
* Release the ocaml mutex with caml_enter_blocking_section when
  entering the main loop. This of course means you must call
  caml_leave_blocking_section before calling any callback. Fortunately
  there are not too many ways to enter callbacks in glut. However,
  there is a further difficulty: you must avoid race conditions when
  making calls to openGL from the toplevel. The simplest way to do
  that is not doing calls directly, but putting them in a queue, and
  executing them in an idle callback from glut. Such an infrastructure
  is defined in gtkThread.ml (for windows users)
The first way is simpler on Unix (no races for free), but the Windows
GDI is such that you cannot call graphical functions from another
thread anyway, so you end up needing the queue. The second approach
feels cleaner, but is harder to program in.
    
** Daniel Bünzli added:

Just in case you are not aware your problem is easy to solve if you use 
sdl [1] instead of glut to setup your gl context and handle input. Sdl 
doesn't own your main loop, you can poll or wait for events and then 
continue with your own code.

This simplifies a lot the interaction with the toplevel. For example, 
you can enter a function from the toplevel which will handle user input 
until the user presses escape to return to the toplevel and reenter the 
function later again. Or you can just initialize the context and then 
paint your window from the toplevel without handling the input in the 
window.

The features you loose with respect to glut is menus and multiple 
windows. But with sdl you don't need threads to solve your problem, you 
control the loop and this may be simpler for students (unless you want 
to introduce them to concurrency at the same time...).


A more brittle path to follow (with glut or whatever) which I did not 
investigate deeply is to use the (hidden) Toploop module and to try to 
render and control the toplevel in one of your glut window. However I 
don't know enough about Toploop to be sure you can get to the expected 
result.

** Following last week's thread, Richard Jones said and Vincenzo Ciancia answered:

This has been proposed, discussed and forgotten more than one time on the
haskell-gui mailing list (of course, s/ocaml/haskell/). The most promising
projects for haskell in this area are htoolkit and wxhaskell:

<http://htoolkit.sourceforge.net/>
<http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/>

I think that to do a serious effort in this direction involves both
designing the abstracted interface, which is nontrivial and perhaps can't
be done much better than wxwidgets, and implementing it - in a way, IMHO,
that can be used by more than one language. 

Wx fails in that direction, since it's written in C++ - there are wxcaml and
wxhaskell of course, but they seem to require lots of manual tuning to
complete the bindings (don't take this too seriously, I might be plain
wrong). Since XML user interfaces are in vogue these days, maybe the best
thing to do is to implement one of these, fulfilling the required
properties, and then binding for any language will be easy. Of course, it
won't be too efficient but when I see web pages that render faster and look
smarter than my "efficient" desktop I think that this is a non-issue.
    
** Gregory Guyomarc'h also answered Richard Jones:

I think it has not yet been mentioned in this thread, but as far as I
understand it, the java Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) do just that. It
acts as a thin layer above the native toolkits (in fact it seems above
the simpler widgets like buttons, labels, etc, others like menu bars are
re-implemented in java). It already supports an impressive set of
backends: gtk, windows, carbon, photon, and motif. I don't know how well
the API compares to wxWidgets', I have never used any of them, but it
seems quite popular.

I've been down this road myself. I posted an OCaml version of Conway's
Game of Life on my webpage [1] a while back that uses "Kog", an OCaml
OpenGL based GUI I've been working on. The Life application only uses
the label, checkbox and button controls, but Kog also supports
spinners and drop-down listboxes.

My experiences building Kog were overall positive. However, writing a
full-featured GUI from scratch is a lot of work, so Kog is likely to
remain a toy implementation for the foreseeable future. If there's
much interest in the OCaml community for this sort of thing though,
I'd love to work with a group on a project getting a full-featured
lightweight GUI up and running with OCaml, whether it be on OpenGL
directly, or one of the higher level vector libraries.

Speaking of GUI libraries, I'm looking into writing a higher-level
wrapper around the GUI parts of Harry Chomsky's OCaml-Win32
library[2]. If anyone has already done this (and made it available
under a LGPL or BSD like license) and I've somehow missed it, please
let me know and I'll contribute to your project rather than
reinventing the wheel.

However it required some Api C "extensions" that I wrote.

3) Open position for a research engineer
Archive: <http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200503/msg00029.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Alain Frisch announced:

The CDuce team is seeking to hire a research engineer for a two month
position in Paris. CDuce is an XML-oriented functional language
developed as a joint research project by three different groups in
Paris (École Normale Supérieure, Université Paris-Sud, INRIA
Rocquencourt), with an Open Source implementation in OCaml.  We are
looking for candidates with a good profiency in OCaml and some
interest in XML-related technologies. An academic background in
Computer Science would be a plus.

Several projects are possible, according to the engineer's
interest and competence. They include:

- improving CDuce packaging, documentation, developing some benchmarks,
   and a regression test suite;

- designing an infrastructure to develop web services and/or
   stateful interactive web applications in CDuce;

- redesigning the existing support for XML Schema as an external tool;

- developing real-sized examples of CDuce (or mixed CDuce/OCaml)
   applications, such as a Bug Tracking System, a Wiki, or a blog
   manager.

4) Camomile 0.6.2
Archive: <http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200503/msg00042.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yamagata Yoriyuki announced:

I'm pleased to announce Camomile 0.6.2, a bug-fix release of Camomile.

Camomile is a comprehensive Unicode library for objective caml
(a. k. a. OCaml or O'Caml) language. Camomile provides Unicode
character type, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 strings, conversion to/from
about 200 encodings, collation and locale-sensitive case mappings, and
more. The library is currently designed for Unicode Standard 3.2.

You can download Camomile 0.6.2 from 

<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/camomile/camomile-0.6.2.tar.bz2?download>

For more information, visit Camomile web page

5) MinCaml: an educational compiler for tiny ML subset (documented inJapanese)
Archive: <http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200503/msg00021.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Eijiro Sumii announced:

I have implemented a simple but efficient compiler from a tiny ML
subset to the SPARC assembly language.

  <http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/min-caml.tar.gz>

The primary purpose is advanced education: the compiler is well
documented (only in Japanese for now, unfortunately)

  <http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/>

and has been used in a class at Tokyo for years.

The compiler consists of only 2000 lines of OCaml.  Yet, it produces
as efficient SPARC code as OCaml and GCC does (for the tiny ML subset
and equivalent C programs).

  A typical functional program (Ackermann):

    GCC 6.8s
    OCaml 0.9s
    MinCaml 0.9s

  A typical imperative program (raytracing):

    GCC 14.7s
    OCaml 36.7s (could perhaps be improved by using BigArray)
    MinCaml 17.0s

So, please take a look if you are interested.  Even if you don't
understand Japanese, you may be able to understand OCaml!:-)
    
** Jon Harrop asked and Eijiro Sumii answered:

> Did you choose SPARC because of availability or for technical reasons?

Both - Sun is still strong in universities around me and IA-32 is a
mess (for me, at least) compared to RISC...

> What features of ML are implemented?

Only a _very_ tiny subset: for now, it does not have polymorphism,
data types, modules, nor garbage collection (so I shouldn't even call
it ML, except that the syntax is a subset of OCaml).  However, it
_does_ have type inference, higher-order functions, floating-point
numbers, tuples, and arrays with destructive update - which are
sufficient for minimal examples (such as gcd, ack, matrix, etc.)  and
one application (raytracing).  Also, it does implement optimizations
such as known-function calls, tail calls, inlining, constant folding,
etc.  It can call external functions if you provide the stubs in
assembly.

The subset is so tiny because MinCaml was developed for an
undergraduate course, where I put most energy to the ease of
understanding and couldn't include many features.  However, adding
them would be a nice project for more advanced students.

By the way, for the majority of people who do not speak Japanese:-), I
am preparing an Enlish documentation.
    
** Eijiro Sumii then announced:

I've uploaded a (rather quick) translation of my MinCaml compiler
tutorial:

  <http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/index-e.html>

It should be readable enough, though I'm not a very good English
writer (and some comments in the source code are still in Japanese).

Comments are welcome.  I don't have so much experience even in
compiler development (unlike Xavier and other real experts here).
    
** Eijiro Sumii asked and Ken Friis Larsen answered:

> I agree.  In fact, I'm looking for a good (as simple and efficient as
> possible) algorithm of pattern matching.  Any suggestions, anyone?

Peter Sestoft has a nice paper about pattern matching:
	 "ML pattern match compilation and partial evaluation"
          In Danvy, Glück, and Thiemann (editors): Partial Evaluation.
          Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, February 1996.
          Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1110, pages 446-464.
          Springer-Verlag 1996
	  <http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/papers/match.ps.gz>

Easy to follow and it has a nice trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.

I agree with that, and it's true that nobody is happy with the current
caml.inria.fr site.

A complete redesign and reimplementation of the caml.inria.fr is in
progress, and should be completed Real Soon Now.  That should provide
a Web site (for caml.inria.fr, www.caml.org and www.ocaml.org) that is
both reasonably modern looking and kept up to date.

There is room for volunteer's efforts in parallel with our efforts, so
if someone wants to resurrect the old ocaml.org, or build a Wiki-based
site for OCaml, you are most welcome and we'll link to your site.
    
** Richard Jones answered:

We're building a more business-focused wiki here:

<http://wiki.cocan.org/>

It has section on, for example, why managers should choose OCaml.  And
lists of people and companies available who use it.  Also sections on
how to install OCaml on various different operating systems.

Sorry for the long delay, but I'm currently having a huge backlog of
mails that need to be answered.

I have now found time to take a closer look at your work, and I think
it looks very promising.  I have just integrated your changes into my
distribution of Vim-files (see signature for link to my new site).

The two indentation styles are still separate, but I think that once OMLet
is stable, we can make it the default.  I'll keep using it as default in
my projects to track down potential problems, but it looks great so far.
Thanks a lot for your work!

9) Using camljava library in a multithreaded context

Yes, but with correct locking, these two calls will execute in
sequence, not in parallel, so it is still OK to store the JNIEnv in
the global variable from jnistubs.c.

The locking can be achieved either at the Java level (by using
synchronized methods on a unique, global object, or equivalently by
using the "synchronized" statement over such an object), or at the C
level using Pthread mutexes or Win32 critical sections.  I'd recommend
doing the locking at the Java level to ensure maximal compatibility
with the Java threading model.

This is not necessary with proper locking as described above.

Probably not.  Moreover, as you mention, Java, Caml and the C layer
between the two can have different notions of threads, so a direct
mapping is generally not possible.

No.

I don't think so.

Locking at the Java level will ensure sequential (not concurrent)
execution of the Caml code and Caml runtime system functions, which is
what you need to enforce.

Unfortunately, I have no experience with Java so I cannot tell you
whether there is a way to let Java-threads migrate to OCaml.

My C-solution, which seems to work very well in practice, looks roughly
as follows:

  pthread_mutex_t cb_act_mtx;
  pthread_cond_t cb_act_cnd;
  value *cb_act;

  pthread_mutex_t cb_res_mtx;
  pthread_cond_t cb_res_cnd;

The first mutex and condition variable protect "cb_act", the callback
action to be performed.

If there is a C-thread that wants to call OCaml, it calls the following
function/method (it's actually C++):

  void do_cb(value *action)
  {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&cb_act_mtx);
      cb_act = action;
      pthread_cond_signal(&cb_act_cnd);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&cb_act_mtx);

    pthread_mutex_lock(&cb_res_mtx);
      while (not cb_res_avail) pthread_cond_wait(&cb_res_cnd, &cb_res_mtx);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&cb_res_mtx);

    cb_res_avail = false;
  }

Depending on the kind of action that should be performed, an OCaml-thread
that has previously gone into C-land will eventually convert C-data to
OCaml-values before performing the callback.  After returning it will
signal the C-thread that a result is available (or simply that it has
completed the job).  The OCaml-thread has to perform all the conversions,
because the C-thread must not call the GC.  Our C-function, in which
the OCaml-thread waits for callbacks + associated data looks as follows:

  virtual value handle_cbs()
  {
    while (true) {
      caml_enter_blocking_section();
        pthread_mutex_lock(&cb_act_mtx);
          while (cb_act == NULL)
            pthread_cond_wait(&cb_act_cnd, &cb_act_mtx);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&cb_act_mtx);
      caml_leave_blocking_section();

      if (cb_act == &v_OnRecordUpdateCallback)
        caml_callback(*cb_act,
                      vrc_make(rup, free_record_update, lev1_GC_setting));
      else if (cb_act == &v_Terminate) {}
      else cb_sc = caml_callback(*cb_act, Val_int(cb_sc));

      pthread_mutex_lock(&cb_res_mtx);
        cb_act = NULL;
        cb_res_avail = true;
        pthread_cond_signal(&cb_res_cnd);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(&cb_res_mtx);

      if (cb_act == &v_Terminate) return Val_unit;
    };

    return Val_unit;  // we should never get here
  }

In OCaml you just need to specify the external function that the
OCaml-thread should call:

  external handle_cbs : t -> unit = "activ_handle_cbs_stub"

Then do something like the following at startup:

  let wrap_handle_cbs () =
    try handle_cbs cgc
    with exc ->
      (match exc with
      | Status sc ->
          eprintf "Activ-exception: Status %s\n" (Status_code.to_string sc)
      | FieldStatus fs ->
          eprintf
            "Activ-exception: FieldStatus %s\n" (Field_status.to_string fs)
      | _ ->
          eprintf "Exception escaping callback: %s\n" (Printexc.to_string exc)
      );
      exit 2 in
  ignore (Thread.create wrap_handle_cbs ());

I hope that this info is enough so that you can make OCaml- and C-threads
interact smoothly.
