      <cwn_title>First releases of dirsp-exchange: auditable variant of Signal Protocol and ProScript-to-OCaml translator</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-releases-of-dirsp-exchange-auditable-variant-of-signal-protocol-and-proscript-to-ocaml-translator/8008/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>jbeckford announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm pleased to announce the first release of
[dirsp-exchange](https://github.com/diskuv/dirsp-exchange#readme), available today from the Opam
repositories.

The intent of the *[dirsp]* libraries is to provide software engineers with auditable source code
that has some level of safety assurance (typically proofs) from security researchers.

The first libraries are:

- dirsp-exchange-kbb2017 0.1.0 - The KBB2017 protocol for securing a two-party conversation. Similar to Signal Protocol v3 and Olm Cryptographic Ratchet.
- dirsp-ps2ocaml 0.1.0 - A ProScript to OCaml translator. ProScript is an executable subset of JavaScript that can be formally verified.

and a couple more supporting libraries.

~dirsp-exchange-kbb2017~ has a build process that generates its own OCaml code using ~dirsp-ps2ocaml~
on formally verified ProScript source code.

The canonical example for ~dirsp-exchange-kbb2017~ is:

#+begin_src ocaml
module P       = Dirsp_proscript_mirage.Make()
module ED25519 = P.Crypto.ED25519
module K       = Dirsp_exchange_kbb2017.Make(P)
module U       = K.UTIL

(* Alice sends a message to Bob *)
let aliceSessionWithBob = T.newSession (* ... supply some keys you create with ED25519 and U ... *) ;;
let aliceToBobSendOutput = T.send
  aliceIdentityKey
  aliceSessionWithBob
  (P.of_string "Hi Bob!")

(* Now you can send the output "aliceToBobSendOutput" from Alice to Bob.
   Let's switch to Bob's computer. He gets notified of a new message using a notification library of
your choosing, and then does ...  *)

let bobSessionWithAlice = T.newSession (* ... supply some keys ... *);;
let bobFromAliceReceiveOutput = T.recv
  bobIdentityKey
  bobSignedPreKey
  bobSessionWithAlice
  theEncryptedMessageBobReceivedFromAlice
assert (bobFromAliceReceiveOutput.output.valid)
Format.printf "Bob just received a new message: %s\n"
  (bobFromAliceReceiveOutput.plaintext |> P.to_bytes |> Bytes.to_string)
#+end_src

These are early releases, especially ~dirsp-ps2ocaml~.

      <cwn_who>Deep in this thread, Romain Calascibetta announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Just to let you know that I spent a time to re-implement the IRC protocol
in OCaml and to deploy a simple MirageOS as
a logger to save discussions into a Git repository. The bot is currently
deployed, the explanation is available here:
https://github.com/dinosaure/cri/tree/master/unikernel
And used for #mirage@irc.libera.chat

It's a nice example about MirageOS/unikernel and I may deploy one to save
#ocaml@irc.libera.chat as whitequark already does with her bot.

      <cwn_title>First release of Jsonxt - a set of JSON parsers and writers</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-jsonxt-a-set-of-json-parsers-and-writers/8018/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Stephen Bleazard announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Jsonxt provides a number of JSON parsers and writers for RFC 8259 compliant JSON as well as
non-standard extensions supported by Yojson.  Features include
- RFC 8259 compliant when in strict and basic mode
- Performance focused especially for files and strings
- Support for standard and extended JSON tree types:
  - Strict follows a strict interpretation of RFC 8259 with all numbers represented as floats.
  - Basic extends the strict type to include convenience types while maintaining RFC compliance.  This is compatible with Yojson's Basic type
  - Extended adds additional non-standard types including tuples and variants and is not RFC compliant. This is compatible with Yojson's Safe type
- A number of different parsers including
  - A standard JSON tree parser for various sources including string, file and channel
  - A Stream parser that returns a stream of raw JSON tokens.
  - A monad based parser compatible with async
- Writers including
  - File and string writers
  - A monad based writer that is compatible with async
  - A stream writer that converts a stream of JSON tokens
- Support for streaming JSON via the [Stream](https://ocaml.org/api/Stream.html) module
- Standard interfaces including Yojson compatibility
- Support for ~ppx_deriving_yojson~ and ~ppx_yojson_conv~ via Yojson compatibility

The package is available via opam, with documentation on
[github.io](https://stevebleazard.github.io/ocaml-jsonxt/jsonxt/index.html).  The source can be found

      <cwn_title>mula 0.1.0, ML's radishal Universal Levenshtein Automata library</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mula-0-1-0-mls-radishal-universal-levenshtein-automata-library/8021/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Ifaz Kabir announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm happy to announce the release of my library ~mula~. The package uses Universal Levenshtein Automata
(ULA) to not only check if a word is within a certain edit distance of another, but to also output what
the edit distance is! It uses the automata themselves to calculate edit distances. A fun use case for
this is that we can feed a set of words to the automaton and immediately rank the words by their edit
distance.

~Mula~ supports both the standard Levenshtein edit distance as well as the Demarau-Levenshtein distance
which counts transpositions of two adjacent characters as a single edit. I also support getting live
error counts, so you can feed part of a string into an automaton, and get the minimum number of errors
that have occurred so far.

I currently have matching working using non-deterministic ULA, but I have partially started the work
toward the deterministic versions. It should be possible to pre-compute the DFAs for up to edit
distance 3 and pack it with the library, never needing to be recomputed because the Universal Automata
are independent of the input strings. But the non-deterministic automata support very large edit
distances: (Sys.int_size - 1)/2, so they have value on their own.

This library came about from a desire to add a "did you mean" feature to a toy compiler, but not
wanting to write the kind of dynamic programming code that you can find in the OCaml compiler [1] or
merlin/spelll [2,3].

You can find the library [here](https://github.com/ifazk/mula/) and the documentation
[here](https://ifazk.github.io/mula/mula/index.html).
It's not on ~opam~ yet, but I have submitted a [pull
request](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/18895).

Happy OCamling!

*** Some details:

I followed the paper by Touzet [1] as much as possible. If you take a look at the code, you'll see a a
lot of +1's for 1-indexing. This was to keep the implementation as close to the paper as possible! (If
you do want to check the implementation against the paper, note that the paper has a typo in Definition 2). For the Demarau-Levenshtein automaton, I adapted Figure 9 from Mitankin's thesis [2]. I'm convinced
that my adaptation works, but my adaptation of Touzet's subsumption relation for Demarau-Levenshtein
might be slightly sub-optimal. If you have question about the adaptation, feel free to ask!

~mula~ does not completely replace c-cube's ~spelll~ package. In particular I don't support any indexs,
etc. But there are some interesting differences in the automata they use. (~w~ stands for the base word
here)
1. The ~spelll~ package creates the Levenshtein Automaton for a single string/word (LA_w), ~mula~ uses Universal Levenshtein Automata (ULA).
2. ~Spelll~ computes a DFA from a non-deterministic automaton that uses eplison transitions. ULA do not have epsilon transitions, but for transitions it looks ahead into the base word ~w~. Additionally the NFA's states/transitions are computable on the fly, so there is no need to store the NFA in memory.
3. ~Spelll~'s automata transitions using characters. ~mula~ computes a bitvector from an input character to transition from states to states. (Computing the bitvector is where the look ahead comes in).
4. ~Spelll~'s automata return ~true~/~false~, and uses a separate function to calculate edit distances. ~Mula~ uses the automaton itself to calculate edit distances, the outputs have type ~int option~. (LA_w can be modified to support this though!)

      <cwn_title>New release of mlcuddidl, the OCaml interface to the CUDD BDD library</cwn_title>

      <cwn_what>
I'm pleased to write this first release announcement for the
[mlcuddidl](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/mlcuddidl) package.

These bindings to the CUDD BDD library were initially written by Bertrand Jeannet and have been around
as an OPAM package for quite some time now.  The source code is now hosted on
[framagit](https://framagit.org/nberth/mlcuddidl).

This release of version 3.0.7 mostly ports the package to OCaml versions ≥ 4.10.

      <cwn_title>first release of orf: OCaml Random Forests</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-orf-ocaml-random-forests/8034/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>UnixJunkie announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I finished implementing a classifier and regressor using Random Forests
(seminal paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324):

https://github.com/UnixJunkie/orf

Some caveats:
- this is somewhat slow; especially the classifier (and I don’t know so much how to accelerate it; probably two orders of magnitude slower than sklearn).
- this is not super generic (int IntMap sparse features only; i.e. a sparse vector of integers represents a sample).

The package is now available in opam (opam install orf).

Two interfaces are exposed:

RFC (for classification)
https://github.com/UnixJunkie/orf/blob/master/src/RFC.mli

RFR (for regression)
https://github.com/UnixJunkie/orf/blob/master/src/RFR.mli

The test file shows some usage examples:
https://github.com/UnixJunkie/orf/blob/master/src/test.ml

If you want to help, I tried to flag a few things for the near future:
https://github.com/UnixJunkie/orf/issues

If you use it and if it is useful to you, I would be happy to know.
