      <cwn_title>You started to learn OCaml less than 12 months ago? Please help us with our user survey on the OCaml.org Learning Area</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/you-started-to-learn-ocaml-less-than-12-months-ago-please-help-us-with-our-user-survey-on-the-ocaml-org-learning-area/11945/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Sabine Schmaltz asked</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We're asking specifically for you, if your experience of learning OCaml is still
ongoing or so recent that you still remember

1. what you struggled with (or still feel like you're struggling),
2. how the current materials failed you,
3. what other materials helped you understand.

if you have previous experience in other languages, we also find it highly
interesting to learn about resources that you found particularly
effective/engaging/educational and why you think they are particularly great.

Our goal is to improve the "Learn" area of OCaml.org - and this is a pretty broad
topic in the sense that we want to provide a framework on OCaml.org where content is
organised properly in such a way that information is easy to find and effective to
use for various people with different backgrounds and learning styles.

The survey is here:
https://forms.gle/L1oQgEs3N9D6qx5v9

If you indicate you're available for interview, our UX designer Claire may contact
you to schedule a video call with you.

There will be a summary of the points brought up no later than May 5 in this thread.

      <cwn_title>First alpha release of OCaml 5.1.0</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/first-alpha-release-of-ocaml-5-1-0/11949/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>octachron announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Four months after the release of OCaml 5.0.0, the set of new features for the
future version 5.1.0 of OCaml has been frozen. I am thus happy to announce the
first alpha release for OCaml 5.1.0 .

This alpha version is here to help fellow hackers join us early in our bug
hunting and opam ecosystem fixing fun (see below for the installation instructions).
You can see the progress on this front at

https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/23669

If you find any bugs, please report them here:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Note that this early alpha version is missing two important fixes for the garbage
collector and Windows support. Those fixes will be available before the beta.
The full release is expected to happen in July.

If you are interested by the ongoing list of new features and bug fixes, the
updated change log for OCaml 5.1.0 is available at:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.1/Changes

*** Installation Instructions
The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1:

#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~alpha1
#+end_src

For previous version of opam, the switch creation command line is slightly more
verbose:

#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 5.1.0~alpha1
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option
variant with:

#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create &lt;switch_name&gt; ocaml-variants.5.1.0~alpha1+options &lt;option_list&gt;
#+end_src

where ~option_list~ is a comma separated list of ocaml-option-* packages. For
instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 5.1.0~alpha1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.1.0~alpha1+options
ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_src

The command line above is slightly more complicated for opam version anterior to 2.1:

#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create &lt;switch_name&gt;
--packages=ocaml-variants.5.1.0~alpha1+options,&lt;option_list&gt;
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
In both cases, all available options can be listed with "opam search ocaml-option".

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

- https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.1.0-alpha1.tar.gz
- https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.1/ocaml-5.1.0~alpha1.tar.gz

Our @yallop is one of the authors of this paper about parsing.

[flap: A Deterministic Parser with Fused Lexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05276)

#+begin_quote
Lexers and parsers are typically defined separately and connected by a token
stream. This separate definition is important for modularity and reduces the
potential for parsing ambiguity. However, materializing tokens as data structures
and case-switching on tokens comes with a cost. We show how to fuse
separately-defined lexers and parsers, drastically improving performance without
compromising modularity or increasing ambiguity. We propose a deterministic variant
of Greibach Normal Form that ensures deterministic parsing with a single token of
lookahead and makes fusion strikingly simple, and prove that normalizing context
free expressions into the deterministic normal form is semantics-preserving. Our
staged parser combinator library, flap, provides a standard interface, but
generates specialized token-free code that runs two to six times faster than
ocamlyacc on a range of benchmarks.

      <cwn_title>Porting a OCaml3-based game to the latest version of OCaml</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/porting-a-ocaml3-based-game-to-the-latest-version-of-ocaml/11968/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>nova4216 asked</cwn_who>

Guys, there is not a trivial task.

There is a game engine on OCaml + a game written on this game engine. This was all
written about 10 years ago, on version Ocaml 3. Camplp4 was used as a preprocessor.
And the compiler was patched to correctly generate ARM code for iOS.

The task is to port the engine and the game to the latest version of Ocaml which
supports arm64 on all platforms by default.

We can make the engine Open Source - maybe it will help the Ocaml community to
release more games in their favorite language for mobile platforms.

If anyone is interested in the task - feel free to contact me, and we will be glad to
discuss the details! Of course, there will be a reward for successful completion of
the task.

The game itself is called The Big Farm Theory.
The engine in this thread is Lightning:
