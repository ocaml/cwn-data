As an answer to Samuel's mail of november the 7th (and coincidently, also to
the one he sent today), I have just written a patch to camlimages solving, at
least for me, the problems I got when trying to compile camlimages under mac
os.

Since I don't know how to contact camlimages' authors, and that all the
patchs I ever sent to macports have always be more or less silently refused,
I temporarily pushed my solution there:

darcs get <a href="http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~meunier/camlimages">http://lama.univ-savoie.fr/~meunier/camlimages</a>

This version uses ocamlbuild instead of omake as its build system, and ocaml
instead of m4/autotools/bash as its configure script. I would be interesting
to know if this version is useful under linux to bypass omake's bugs for the
versions before the next one.

My original idea was not at all to start a new ocaml-tools war, I'm sorry if
my first message was poorly formulated. Let me make myself clear, I wrote a
typesetting system in ocaml, in order to write my PhD thesis. The way it
works is a little strange, it compiles your source to ocaml source code (our
language is quite cool, because based on a dypgen grammar, but you can use
another one if you have time to write a parser and code generator). Then it
compiles this code with a library called "Typography", that does all the
document processing stuff, optimization of the page breaks, and so on.
Finally, it calls another library to output to different formats, such as
pdf, plain text, svg, opengl, or anything else.

These are clearly "separable but not independent" projects (drivers, document
formats, font library, typesetting library, parser/code generator). So
compiling everything without duplication is not that trivial, and I really
would like to write an ocaml program to compile it, maybe using a more
complex build system than just one file with the ocamlbuild api. I understand
that ocamlbuild is still in an early stage of development, this is why I'm
sending these mails. The code is split among different directories, and using
a library interface in the compilation of another library still seems
difficult in ocamlbuild today. The documentation explains how to use an
internal library in program, but it forces you to use a particular layout of
your files. This is why I feel that a library would be more versatile: we can
imagine a makefile compiling the build system first, possibly split between
several modules, then calling it to compile the rest, like xmonad does, for
instance.

Also, if you are writing a document with our system, separated between
different files, you want the system to compile it automatically, without too
much recompilation. The problem is extensibility: for instance, if you are
writing a bibliography library (I wrote one, but there may be others in the
future), you certainly do not want to touch our code in order to compile it.
Instead, you want to write a dynlinkable module explaining to our system how
the documents depend on bibliography files, and how to compile everything in
what order.
To do this, I had to rewrite a (small) ocamlbuild-like library. My point is
that ocamlbuild exposes (or documents) a too small part of its internals to
be re-used inside another project.
      </pre><i>Fabrice Le Fessant then replied:</i><br /><pre>
Actually, this use case is exactly the reason why I developed the
"ocp-build" tool (you might have used it if you tried to compile
opam). It's much less powerful than ocamlbuild, but for what it does,
it is much simpler to use. The idea is to write a simple description
of the package contained in each directory. The tool then scans all
the sub-directories looking for these descriptions (in files with .ocp
extensions), use the specified dependencies between packages to order
them, and then build all of them incrementally (no unnecessary
rebuild) and in parallel.

Since the description is only for OCaml files, it is very simple and
short, but of course, if you are doing complicated things, you won't
be able to express them in such a simple language...

There is currently no documentation, and 'opam install ocp-build' will
install a one-year old version (but latest sources are in the typerex2
branch of typerex), so I would not advise anybody to use it curently,
except for playing, but I (and some others in my team) found that it
is a convenient tool for most of our needs.

For example, the opam file looks like :

begin
comp += [ "-g" "-annot" "-warn-error" "A" ]
link += [ "-g" ]
begin library "opam-lib"
subdir = [ "src" ]
files = [
"opamGlobals.ml" ...
"repo/opamGit.ml" "opamSolver.ml" "opamClient.ml"
]
requires = [ "cudf" "dose" "unix" "graph" "re_glob" ]
end
begin program "opam"
subdir = [ "src" ]
files = [ "opamMain.ml" ]
requires = [ "opam-lib" "arg" ]
end
begin program "opam-mk-repo"
files = [ "src/scripts/opam_mk_repo.ml"]
requires = [ "opam-lib" ]
end
begin program "opam-check"
files = [ "src/scripts/opam_check.ml" ]
requires = [ "opam-lib" ]
end
begin program "opam-repo-check"
files = [ "src/scripts/opam_repo_check.ml" ]
requires = [ "opam-lib" ]
end
end

Among the current drawbacks, there is no compatibility with findlib
descriptions, nor any easy way to guess the current installed
packages, so you have to create a file describing your environment.
For example, in opam, it comes with a file 'ocaml-libs.ocp'
containing:

begin
generated = true
dirname = [ "%{OCAMLLIB}%" ]
has_byte = true
has_asm = true
begin library "unix" end
begin library "str"
requires = [ "unix" ]
end
begin library "dynlink" end
begin library "camlp4fulllib"
requires = [ "dynlink" ]
has_asm = false
end
begin library "bigarray" end
begin library "threads"
dirname = [ "%{OCAMLLIB}%/threads" ]
end
end

to describe all the default libraries. We hope that the tool, at some
point, will be able to either read META files, or packages will come
with an .ocp file describing them...

Finally, another nice thing is the "packing" syntax. For example, to
compile sexplib with ocp-build, we use :

begin library "sexplib"
files = [
pack Sexplib [
"type.ml"; "parser.mly"; "lexer.mll"
"pre_sexp.ml" ( pp = [ "cpp"; "-undef"; "-traditional" ] );
"sexp_intf.ml"; "sexp.ml";
"path.ml" "conv.ml" "conv_error.ml" "exn_magic.ml" "std.ml"
]
]
requires = [ "bigarray" "nums" ]
end

to pack all the modules within the "Sexplib" module.

I'm messing around with the new GADT feature in OCaml 4.0, trying to write a
(more or less) strongly typed EDSL. And I've run into non-exhaustive
pattern-matching warnings (see below for an example). I'm pretty sure that it
is just an inherent shortcoming of GADTs, not a bug. The workaround is easy
as well, simply add a catch all clause with a runtime error to silence the
warning, and prove manually that the offending patterns can not occur.

I tried to find more information on this topic, but without getting all
academic, documentation on GADT seems sparse at best. The description of the
original implementation at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ocamlgadt/">https://sites.google.com/site/ocamlgadt/</a> seems to
be the most comprehensive I've found so far. And I'm not sure the information
about exhaustiveness is still up to date.

It would be nice if somebody could maybe shed some more light on this.

Cheers
Kaspar


Code that illustrates the problem:

module T :
sig
type 'a t
val int : int t
end
=
struct
type 'a t = ()
let int = ()
end

type ('r,_) args =
| ANil : ('r,'r) args
| ACons : 'a * ('r,'b) args -&gt; ('r,'a -&gt; 'b) args

let a = ANil
let b = ACons (3, ANil)

type ('r,'a) fun' =
| FVoid : 'r T.t -&gt; ('r,'r) fun'
| FLambda : 'a T.t * ('r,'b) fun' -&gt; ('r,'a -&gt; 'b) fun'

let f = FVoid T.int
let g = FLambda (T.int, f)

let rec apply : type r a . (r,a) fun' * (r,a) args -&gt; unit = function
| FVoid t, ANil -&gt; ()
| FLambda (t,f), ACons (_,a) -&gt; apply (f,a)
(*
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
(FLambda (_, _), ANil)

      </pre><i>Jacques Le Normand replied:</i><br /><pre>
The exhaustiveness check problem IS fundamental to GADTs. The problem
is similar to one of theorem proving:
given theorems t1, t2, ..., tn, all of the form forall a1, ..., an. e,
where e does not contain any existential or universal quantifiers, is
a quantifier free theorem Z provable using intuitionistic logic. I
believe that the problem I just stated is semi decidable: if it is
provable, then you will find a proof if you search enough. If there is
no proof, then you are doomed to search forever. Someone please
correct me if I'm wrong.

In our case, t1, t2, ..., tn are the constructors and Z is the type of
the guard. Our problem is simpler because the type of our constructors
are of a simpler form: forall a1, ..., an . e -&gt; (b1, b2, ..., bn) C
where C is our type constructor and b1, ..., bn are arbitrary
quantifier free formulae. If anyone knows anything about the
decidability of this potentially simpler problem, I'd very much like
to know.

The way O'Caml currently handles GADT exhaustiveness is like so: it
searches for non exhaustive patterns in the same manner as before and
whatever it finds it tries to type. However, these patterns may
contain wildcards.
      </pre><i>Jeremy Yallop also replied:</i><br /><pre>
Here's how you know that the offending pattern can never match a value: the
ANil constructor would constrain "r" and "a" to denote the same type, and the
arguments of the FLambda constructor would have types "'a T.t" and "('a -&gt; 'b,
'b) fun'" (for suitable 'a and 'b). It's then sufficient to show that at
least one of these types is not inhabited. However, in order to show this you
need to use information about the possible ways of building values of those
types: for example, you need to know that there's no polymorphic value of type
"'a t". If you add such a value to the T module:

module T :
sig
type 'a t
val int : int t
val poly : 'a t
end
=
struct
type 'a t = ()
let int = ()
let poly = ()
end

then you *can* build values that match the missing patterns:

# apply (FLambda (T.int, FVoid T.poly), ANil)
Exception: Match_failure ("//toplevel//", 113, 9).

I don't think that the exhaustiveness checker has any information available
regarding the possible ways of constructing values of an abstract type.

Here's an example without GADTs illustrating the same issue. Suppose we have
your original definition of the T module:

module T :
sig
type 'a t
val int : int t
end
=
struct
type 'a t = ()
let int = ()
end

We can define a datatype with two constructors using T.t:

type s =
Int of int T.t
| Float of float T.t

Since there is no value of type "float T.t", patterns involving the Float
constructor are redundant. However, the exhaustiveness checker doesn't know
that, so you'll still get a warning for omitting the Float case:

Characters 8-28:
let f = function Int _ -&gt; ();;
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
Float _

For fun, I’ve started to write some gdb scripts to inspect the memory
of an OCaml program. Without type information, I can only print
immediates and blocks hierarchy, and of course with type information I
can display values as they appear in the source code.

The way to pass type information (and other things) to the debugger
would be to make the compiler output DWARF data. OCaml just started to
output debug information with CFI (Calling Frame Information, since
OCaml 4.0.0), but debugging OCaml native programs with gdb could
become awesome with information like a precise source code →
executable code mapping, values location, type information, etc.

I’ve read some docs about the DWARF format, and I’ve looked at the
OCaml compiler : a lot of code is to be (re)written in order to pass
debug information from source code AST to backends, but I would like
to try anyway. I’ve discovered that a « dwarf » branch already exist
on the repository: it is actively developped by « shinwell » since
september. Even if it looks far from completion, it seems to have the
same goal.

I could not find any reference to this branch on the Web nor on this
list, so before I contact directly this developper, I prefer to ask
here: are there any information about this on the Internet? (goal,
roadmap, …) I would be very interested in contributing to this.
      </pre><i>Mark Shinwell replied:</i><br /><pre>
Yeah, I'm working on full DWARF output for ocamlopt, including the
appropriate gdb support. This is a fairly complicated undertaking,
shall we say, and it will be a while until it's ready for a first
release.

This work should also permit reverse debugging of OCaml programs
using gdb.

A very small snippet of the work in progress is below.

The outcome for package manager is pretty obvious, oasis-db should
focus on OPAM as a package manager. This is now on my todo list,

Concerning build system:
- ocamlbuild is first (60%)
- native Makefile is second (40%)

So I'll probably focus on this two build systems, which represents at
least 70% of what people need (the 3rd build system is less than 30%).
