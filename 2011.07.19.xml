      <cwn_title>ocaml-fastrandom v0.0.2: Fast random number generator</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://sympa-roc.inria.fr/wws/arc/caml-list/2011-07/msg00088.html</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Sylvain Le Gall announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
A random number generator compatible with standard library Random
module (pre OCaml 3.12).

It contains C code to speed up generation and a function to skip a lot of
numbers at once. Benchmarks show a 3 fold increase in speed for generating
random numbers.

This library only contains what I need, so it maybe incomplete for
you, contact me if you want more functions.

      <cwn_what>
libarchive is a C library for reading and writing tar, cpio, zip, ISO, and
other archive formats. This library is its OCaml bindings.

* Reads a variety of formats, including tar, pax, cpio, zip, xar, lha, ar,
  cab, mtree, and ISO images.
* Writes tar, pax, cpio, zip, xar, ar, ISO, mtree, and shar archives.
* Full automatic format detection when reading archives, including
  compressed archives.

This library is developped in lazy mode: I only implement what I use. So
this version mainly support read operationsi. Don't hesitate to contact me if 
you think there is some great libarchive functions not here.

      <cwn_title>new project for an OCaml community website</cwn_title>

An effort to build a new modern website for the OCaml community was
announced at the User Meeting in April. We now have a project on the
forge and welcome you to join. There are several ways to be involved:

Join the mailing list [1] for developers, which will be used to
discuss implementation of the site, including coding matters and
decisions about content. Discussions requiring input from the broader
community will still be posted to the main list.

Become a developer by clicking the "Request to join" link
[2]. Developers are those who will actively write code for the site,
and at first developers will also be writing the bulk of the
content. Eventually, we hope the community will add content directly
on the site via wiki like features. Our plan is to implement the site
in Ocsigen, so this is a great opportunity to learn about this
exciting new set of tools for OCaml.

Suggest ideas to the development team. We are maintaing an ideas file
[3] listing our desired features. Please review it, and give us your
feedback.
