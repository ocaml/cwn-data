Release of pacomb 1.4
═════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/release-of-pacomb-1-4/17630/1>

  Dear camlers, I am pleased to announce the release of pacomb 1.4.

  Pacomb is a library + ppx to write grammars. It support: self
  extensible grammars, ambiguous grammars (with merge), late rejection
  of rule via raising exception from action code, priority and
  others. Is it relatively fast because it is compiled to efficient
  combinators. More details are available in the [git page] and the
  [documentation].

  As teaser, the usual calculator example:

  ┌────
  │ (* The three levels of priorities *)
  │ type p = Atom | Prod | Sum
  │ 
  │ let%parser rec
  │      (* This includes each priority level in the next one *)
  │      expr p = Atom < Prod < Sum
  │             (* all other rules are selected by their priority level *)
  │             ; (p=Atom) (x::FLOAT)                        => x
  │             ; (p=Atom) '(' (e::expr Sum) ')'             => e
  │             ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '*' (y::expr Atom) => x*.y
  │             ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '/' (y::expr Atom) => x/.y
  │             ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '+' (y::expr Prod) => x+.y
  │             ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '-' (y::expr Prod) => x-.y
  └────

  Here is a list of the main changes from 1.3:

  • Add a "not charset combinator" for regexp `\[!...\]', it is distinct
    from `\[^...\]' as it parses nothing.
  • File was not closed by Grammar.parse_file in case of parse error
  • New Grammar.set_debug_merge to allow debugging ambiguous grammars
    (report by Matthieu Lemerre)
  • Compatibility with latest ocaml and ppxlib
  • Travis action to check compilation
  • Various documentation fix

  Possible roadmap for future version:

  • 1.5 : integrate a lexical entry for ocaml code with call back for
    specific {xxx| … |xxx}. This is code existing in simple_httpd’s
    chaml parser (equivalent to php but in cocaml), that I wish to
    integrate in pacomb.
  • 2.0 : rewrite the combinators with algebraic effects. The semantics
    will be much better than the current implementation using
    references.

  Cheers,

  Christophe

Frontmatter_extractor.0.1
═════════════════════════

  Archive:

Mikhail announced

  Hi there! :waving_hand:

  I am writing again about my new library, which I must create, because
  there is simply no alternative available.

  [Frontmatter_extractor] is a small library that extracts the front
  matter section of a text file. It is commonly used in static content
  generators (blog engines, etc), such as those that convert Markdown
  files into HTML or other formats.

  *Example of usage*

  ┌────
  │ let some_text = {|
  │ ---
  │ title: "My First Blog Post"
  │ date: 2025-12-1
  │ ---
  │ 
  │ Hello! It's just some text...
  │ |};;
  └────

  Extract frontmatter as plain text.
  ┌────
  │ # Frontmatter_extractor.of_string some_text;;
  │ 
  │ - : Frontmatter_extractor.extracted =
  │ {Frontmatter_extractor.matter =
  │   Some "\ntitle: \"My First Blog Post\"\ndate: 2025-12-1\n";
  │  body = "\n\nHello! It's just some text...\n"}
  └────

  Extract the front matter as parsed YAML values. The yaml library needs
  to be installed.

  ┌────
  │ # Frontmatter_extractor_yaml.of_string_exn some_text;;
  │ 
  │ - : Frontmatter_extractor_yaml.extracted =
  │ {Frontmatter_extractor_yaml.attrs =
  │   Some
  │    (`O [("title", `String "My First Blog Post"); ("date", `String "2025-12-1")]);
  │  body = "\n\nHello! It's just some text...\n"}
  └────

  *P.S.*

  It's not fully tested, but it's usable as a first version.

QCheck 0.90: The Great Renaming
═══════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-qcheck-0-90-the-great-renaming/17613/2>


Continuing this thread, Jan Midtgaard announced
───────────────────────────────────────────────

  Version 0.91 of the QCheck packages is now available:

  <https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/releases/tag/v0.91>

  This release adds [ocamlmig] annotations to most of the renamed
  combinators, in an attempt to ease migration for users. From my
  experiments so far, these work pretty well and allowed me to port
  [multicoretests] with little effort. Thanks to @raphael-proust for the
  suggestion and @v-gb for a nice tool! :folded_hands:

  Happy migration and testing! :smiley:
