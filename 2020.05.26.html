Thank you @elizabethlvova for this link.

<p>
Hi @hannes, and other MirageOS developers if they know the answer. I am curious about the soft real-time
applications.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What kind of latency do you target, and what kind of latency does OCaml allows you to achieve? Are there concrete evaluations about it in the context of MirageOS? (Bonus internet points if they are public so as to be referenced in a paper, that would be very helpful to me!)</li>
<li>I have learnt on this discuss that low-latency can be obtained in OCaml by writing in a special style where you promote very little. Do you sometimes have to pay attention to your allocation patterns when you program for MirageOS? Have you ever had to profile an application for latency, and fix it by changing allocation patterns?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d79f09">
<p>
I am not sure whether there's anyone focussing on low-latency MirageOS unikernels. My goal is to first get robust and
sustainable infrastructure. I have been playing a bit with an old version of statmemprof to figure out allocation
profiles (and landmarks for profiling code), but I am not aware of any in-depth allocation analysis. The closest I am
aware of is httpaf's motivational benchmarks <a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/httpaf#performance">https://github.com/inhabitedtype/httpaf#performance</a>. Also
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/968">https://github.com/mirage/mirage/pull/968</a> in respect to our IP stack, but I still feel there's room for improvement
(such as using String/Byte instead of Bigarray; avoid allocation of small structures when sending data).

<p>
It is interesting you mentioned this. Isn’t the usage of bigarray more efficient than String/bytes? I think httpaf
uses bigstringaf and faraday which seems to pervasively use bigarray as its primary buffer data structure. Isn’t this
a performant choice?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a good question, and it's helpful to understand what each datastructure is backed by, and what operations are
inefficient.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Bigarray</code> is a pointer to externally allocated memory of arbitrary length. It supports creating smaller views of the same memory without copying it, which is implemented at the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/runtime/caml/bigarray.h#L78">OCaml runtime level</a>. Accessing data within bigarrays is fast thanks to some compiler primitives which allow for endian-neutral parsing and serialisation, implemented by <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocplib-endian">ocplib-endian</a>.</li>
<li>Bigarrays are extremely convenient for network IO, since they support everything needed for minimal copying of data from the OS.  You can exchange memory pages directly from the OS into the OCaml heap, and process them. Unfortunately, one operation is critically slow here &#x2013; creating a substring. Bigarray's provenance was originally to interop better with Fortran-style HPC code, where the size and dimensionality of arrays is generally large.  For IO, we just want really speedy 1-dimension arrays, and in this usecase Bigarray substring creation is very slow due to the underlying reference counting. Thus <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct">cstruct</a> was born, which keep a single underlying Bigarray structure and allocates <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct/blob/master/lib/cstruct.mli#L143">small OCaml records</a> on the minor heap for subviews. These are cheap to create and GC, and the underlying data is not copied unless requested.</li>
<li>Strings are immutable and sit in the OCaml heap, and require a data copy from the outside world into them.  Under some circumstances (usually small allocations) they can be more performant.</li>
<li>Buffers are a resizable String, and efficient if you need to concatenate lots of data of unknown size.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the final answer, as with many systems performance problems about what is "efficient" depends on your allocation
patterns. For transmitting data, there is often a number of small pieces of data that are combined onto a set of
pages for the write path. In this case, a hybrid of "in-heap" assembly using small strings followed by blitting into
a Bigarray is reasonable. For reading, parsing directly from a Bigarray into a cstruct works well.

<blockquote>
<p>
Compared to string/byte, Bigarray doesn’t have much of an advantage. Allocation is always relatively expensive, and
accessing it requires going through the C API,
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is basically all incorrect; please see above. Accessing Bigarrays can be done via builtin compiler primitives
that make it fast. And the point of using them is to avoid multiple small allocations, especially on the read path.

<p>
The basic approach to low latency OCaml hasn't really changed much in the last few decades. You just need to minimise
allocation to maximise GC throughput, and OCaml makes it fairly easy to write that sort of low level code.  Two
papers that might be helpful:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.tjd.phlegethon.org/words/eurosys07-melange.pdf">"Melange: Towards a functional internet"</a>, EuroSys 2007. Contains a latency analysis of an SSH and DNS server <span class="underline">vs</span> C equivalents, and some techniques on writing low-latency protocol parsers.  These days, we do roughly the same thing with ppx's and cstructs, without the DSL in the way.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi15/nsdi15-paper-madhavapeddy.pdf">"Jitsu: Just-in-Time Summoning of Unikernel;s"</a>, NSDI 2015.  This shows the benefits of whole-system latency control &#x2013; you can mask latency by doing some operations concurrently, which is easy to do in unikernels and hard in a conventional OS.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We've never really built systems in the "soft realtime" sense so far &#x2013; for example no video transmission system or
isochronous Bluetooth implementations. Internet protocols are very resilient to variable latency, although of course
we want to keep things as low as possible.  I've been looking into multipath multicast video transmission in Mirage
recently due to the current work-at-home situation, so that might change soon depending on how it goes :slight_smile:
</p>

<p>
One thing that has changed in the past decade is the <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/building-a-lower-latency-gc/">steadily improving latency
profile</a> of the OCaml GC, which has only been improving
thanks to @damiendoligez's steady work. That has let us get away with not directly addressing latency much in Mirage
itself, as every upgrade of the compiler is a pleasant improvement.

I just would like to add a <span class="underline">pro</span> about <code>bigarray</code>, due to the fact that a <code>bigarray</code> can not move in your heap, we
have the ability to release the runtime lock for some computations such as <span class="underline">hash algorithms</span> as <code>digestif</code> does:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/digestif/pull/70">https://github.com/mirage/digestif/pull/70</a>
</p>

<p>
About MirageOS, we currently mostly use <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct"><code>cstruct</code></a> which has an other
difference with <code>bigarray</code>, the underlying record. Such design is to be more efficient when we do a <code>sub</code> operation
as @ivg said here: <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/working-with-a-huge-data-chunks/3955/10?u=dinosaure">https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/working-with-a-huge-data-chunks/3955/10?u=dinosaure</a>
</p>

<p>
However, the question to choose <code>Bytes.t</code> or <code>Cstruct.t</code> (or <code>Bigstring.t</code> ) is a bit hard and it really depends on
your context - and, as @xavierleroy said :slight_smile: :
</p>

<p>
&gt; Mirage people don’t seem to care, as they allocate small bigarrays like crazy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And indeed, @xavierleroy is right that we allocate like crazy, with the caveat that this only really happens on the
transmission path of most protocols. Reads tend to go through a more minimal copy discipline.
</p>

<p>
We certainly do care about this, but it has to be fixed upstream in OCaml as we have reached the limits of what we
can practically do with Bigarray &#x2013; I am hoping that multicore OCaml is the perfect time to <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-a-dynamic-checker-for-detecting-naked-pointers/5805/15?u=avsm">unify all these IO
approaches</a> in that
direction as part of that effort. Mirage will benefit from whatever happens there eventually.

We're happy to release an OCaml compiler switch for dynamically detecting naked pointers in the code.

<h4 id="org9900ccb">Naked pointers in OCaml</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9900ccb">
<p>
A naked pointer is a pointer outside the OCaml heap without a valid header. A header outside the heap is said to be
valid if it is colored black. OCaml does <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html#ss:c-outside-head">permit naked
pointers</a> to word-aligned addresses.
However, the presence of naked pointers incurs overhead in the garbage collector (GC). Whenever the  GC intends to
follow a pointer, it must check that the pointer is indeed in the OCaml heap. The GC consults a page table that
maintains the list of pages currently used by the heap and only follows the pointer if it belongs to one of the
pages. As you can imagine, this adds some overhead in the GC. For the multicore GC, maintaining a page table that
remains consistent when multiple domains are allocating and running GC in parallel would necessitate some
synchronization around the page table for reading and writing to it. It is quite likely that this cost will be
prohibitive.

Luckily, OCaml already has a <code>no-naked-pointer</code> mode where the compiler <b>assumes</b> that the code does not have naked
pointers, and hence, does not consult the page table for following pointers during GC (<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/8984">except <code>Closure_tag</code>
objects</a>). The <code>no-naked-pointer</code> mode is a configure-time option, enabled
by configuring the compiler with <code>--disable-naked-pointers</code>. Multicore OCaml compiler does not use a page table in
its implementation currently.

<p>
With the aim of migrating to <code>no-naked-pointer</code> mode as the default in future releases of OCaml, eventually paving
the way for upstreaming multicore support, we're happy to release a variant of OCaml 4.10.0 with a dynamic checker
for the presence of naked pointers in the code. <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9534">OCaml PR#9534</a> has the
discussion around this checker. This variant can be installed with:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ opam update
$ opam switch create 4.10.0+nnpcheck
$ eval $(opam env)
</pre>

<p>
Once the variant is installed, you can install your favorite libraries using <code>opam</code> and run your program to get a
report of naked pointers. Let us look at an example. We know that <code>frama-c</code> has naked pointers.

As @gasche had mentioned earlier, the no-naked-pointers mode was already there in OCaml and it is known to work on
all the platforms that OCaml was supported. Hence, it was a reasonable path to pursue for Multicore.
</p>

<p>
The concurrent minor collector in Multicore OCaml uses the virtual address space trick, but only for the minor heap
area. It needs contiguous 4GB reserved for 128 domains, each with max 16MB minor heap arena. This can be modified at
compiler configure time. For comparison the minor heap is 2MB by default in OCaml and so 16MB should be quite enough.
We hadn't considered this trick for the major heap in Multicore.
</p>

<p>
However, given our experimental evaluation (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663">paper</a>), we have chosen not to
pursue concurrent minor collector for the initial version of multicore support to be upstreamed. The alternative
stop-the-world parallel minor collector scales better and does not break the C FFI. The parallel minor collector does
not need the virtual address space trick.
</p>

<p>
Given that the space for the entire heap should be reserved, how would it work on 32-bit architectures, and does it
have an impact on system tooling. Looking forward to reading @gadmm's RFC.

<p>
As someone with an interest in cross-language interop, I like naked pointers. So I’m interested in design choices
that might make the “our heap or not?” check fast, and in reasons why impls might not go for them. Feel free to
answer “read the paper”, but I was thinking you could do something like reserve a big contiguous chunk of VAS for
OCaml heaps’ use, and then the test could be a simple shift and compare. Would that be viable?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Please do note that this isn't a performance improvement for OCaml &#x2013; this very much a correctness fix.  The failure
case is as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a naked pointer is created using <code>malloc</code> on the C heap and held in the OCaml heap</li>
<li>the external region is <code>free</code>'d, but the naked pointer is still held in some OCaml heap.</li>
<li>the GC ~malloc~s to expand, and that recently freed C memory becomes part of the OCaml heap</li>
<li>the GC then follows the naked pointer by treating it as an OCaml value, since the page table indicates that it is within the OCaml heap.  However, the memory the naked pointer is aimed at is not necessarily a valid OCaml value as it was formerly a C pointer.</li>
<li>memory corruption ensues</li>
</ul>

<p>
The only way to really avoid this is by only holding naked references to static or global C values, which is a pretty
minority usecase. As @lpw25 notes, you can hold them safely by wrapping them in custom blocks, which is entirely safe
as it gives the GC a reliable way to determining what's going on.
</p>

<p>
As for the question about a contiguous VA, this should work fine on 64-bit, where you have the luxury of such use of
the address space. I built a version of this a decade ago for OCaml/Xen in early Mirage, which you can find evaluated
in the <a href="http://mort.io/publications/pdf/hotcloud10-lamp.pdf">HotCloud 2010 paper</a> (Figure 4).  It's pretty
straightforward, but the problems come from balancing external memory pressure (from C allocations) with the OCaml
allocation.  This can be adjusted with an obvious use of <code>sbrk</code> or <code>realloc</code> to grow or shrink the contiguous memory,
while being careful to keep other memory allocations away from the OCaml area.
</p>

<p>
The current strategy will need to be maintained for 32-bit architectures however, which are very much supported (e.g.
armv7).  For those, there is very little wiggle room to hold a contiguous VA and so the current multicore approach
lets us preserve a unified memory representation.
</p>

<p>
One observation I had when I read @stephenrkell's excellent essay is how strange our current memory allocation
mechanisms are in operating systems.  We have conflated cooperative scheduling across components with enforcing
protection from mutually untrusted control flow in the same language.  For example, we have the system C malloc
competing with the OCaml GC which competes with the kernel memory allocator.  I've been sketching out a possible
solution in multicore OCaml towards this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We move away from <code>Bigarray</code> to a specialised <code>Extvalue</code> that handles external pages in a separate region of memory.  Bigarray currently offers too much functionality (subarrays and proxies) which slows it down due to dropping into the C FFI.</li>
<li>The <code>Extvalue</code> is backed by a bundled slab allocator that works in a contiguous region of memory, disjoint from the OCaml heap.</li>
<li>The compiler provides primitives for very fast translation of values in and out of the <code>Extvalue</code> (as it does currently for <code>Bigarray</code>).</li>
<li>C libraries linked in with OCaml also use this memory allocator for their own mallocs. This will require some trickery (static compilation or LD_PRELOAD initially), but it means that all the allocations associated with a particular "task" (from OCaml to C or Rust code) can be batched together.</li>
<li>This approach lets us improve multicore memory locality greatly, as every modern machine has significant NUMA effects (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4pUbq09Lw">FOSDEM 2013 talk</a>), and cooperatively allocate memory. It also leaves open the possibility of separate isolation mechanisms (such as ARM memory domains or Intel MPK) <span class="underline">across</span> tasks in a large heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that the above is still only at the experimental stage as I'm still evaluating it, but it does have the
advantage of degrading gracefully if the system malloc has to be used (e.g. if OCaml is embedded as a library, noone
expects 10GBs gigabit levels of network performance).  From an ecosystem perspective, I don't think anyone really
wants to maintain the current hybrid world of a multitude of <code>Bigarray</code>-based overlays, such as cstruct or bigstring.

The <code>mod</code> operator always has the same sign as the numerator.  I think this is for historical reasons, although I
don't know whether to point the finger at C, or x86, or something even earlier.
</p>

<p>
If you use Base, the <code>%</code> operator gives you the Euclidean modulo operator that I think you're looking for.  Its
result always has the same sign as the denominator.  This operator is basically equivalent to:

This is a "feature" in most programming languages and I think actually corresponds to the standard way division is
implemented in the CPU itself (so it has little to do with OCaml). How this was allowed to become the standard I do
not know.
</p>

<p>
One thing is that I get the impression that people who are not familiar with number theory find the following result
extremely  counter-intuitive : <code>(-3) / 2 = -2</code>
</p>

<p>
I believe it is because they think of integer division as an approximation of real division, rather than as being its
own special thing, and from this perspective it makes no sense that making a number negative should change the
result. They expect the identities that hold of real division (like <code>(a*b) / c = a * (b/c)</code>) to also hold for integer
division. (I say "they" not to belittle the perspective, I totally see where they are coming from.)
</p>

<p>
But then if you have <code>(-3) / 2 = -1</code>, you need to have <code>(-3) mod 2 = -1</code> to preserve the relation between <code>/</code> and
<code>mod</code> that you mention (so you'll note that the relation does hold in this system).
</p>

<p>
I tend to think that the behaviour where <code>mod</code> never returns anything negative, in addition to being what a
mathematician would expect, is strictly more useful (for what I believe to be the typical use case of modulo over
negative numbers in programming, which is indexing into a circular buffer). And I also think that you almost never
divide negative numbers, so the useful behaviour for <code>mod</code> should have taken priority when deciding how all this
works, and whether <code>/</code> is intuitive or not does not matter much in practice. But I have no idea who took that
decision and whether such issues were even considered.

Thanks for this! So the one found in OCaml and most languages is T-division (for truncating) and the one I called
more useful is E-division (for Euclidean) which the paper argues for. It says that T-division is found in Ada, that
Lisp has two modulo operators, one that does T-division and one that does F-division (halfway between T and E, and
works for the circular buffer case), and that Algol and Pascal break the relation between div and mod by doing
T-division for div and E-division for mod (if I got it right). Interesting stuff.

I’ve just released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth">tablecloth</a> - an easy-to-use,
comprehensive standard library that has the same API on all OCaml/ReasonML/Bucklescript platforms.
</p>

<p>
0.0.7 is a pretty decent release, including many new functions in the List, Array, Int, Float, Option, and Result
modules, as well as the addition of a new Fun module and support for the latest version of bs-platform for the
bucklescript version of tablecloth.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth">the tablecloth github repo</a> for installation instructions, or read the

tablecloth for motivation.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Dean Merchant and I have agreed to merge his <a href="https://github.com/Dean177/reason-standard">Standard</a>
library into tablecloth. Dean has done a significant amount of the work in tablecloth since the original release, and
we plan to release a version 0.0.8 after merging the two code bases together. Dean is now a maintainer of tablecloth.

<p>
The Multicore OCaml team has made significant progress in the recent years. There now seems to be interest in working
on the high-level parallelism constructs. Such constructs are also tightly connected to the problem of controlling
the granularity of parallel tasks.
</p>

<p>
I've been working on parallel constructs and granularity control from 2011 to 2019, together with Umut Acar and Mike
Rainey. We published a number of papers, each of them coming with theoretical bounds, an implementation, and
evaluation on state-of-the-art benchmark of parallel algorithms.
</p>

<p>
While we mainly focused on C++ code, I speculate that nearly all of our ideas could be easily applied to Multicore
OCaml. Porting these ideas would deliver what seems to be currently missing in Multicore OCaml for efficiently
implementing a large class of parallel algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel Scherer and François Pottier recently suggested to me that it appears timely to share these results with the
OCaml community. I'll thus try to give an easily-accessible, OCaml-oriented introduction to the results that we have
produced. Note, however, that most of the ideas presented would apply essentially to another other programming
language that aims to support nested parallelism.
</p>

<p>
I plan to cover the semantics of high-level parallelism constructs, to describe and argue for work-stealing
scheduling, to present a number of tricks that are critical for efficiency, and to advertise for our modular,
provably-efficient approach to granularity control. I'll post these parts one after the other, as I write them.
