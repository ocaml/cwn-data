* release 0.2.2 of ppx_deriving_encoding
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-0-2-2-of-ppx-deriving-encoding/7169/1

** levillain.maxime announced


Following the release of [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-json-data-encoding-0-9/7157][json-data-encoding.0.9]], I am
happy to announce the release of ppx_deriving_encoding.0.2.2.

The code source and some documentation is available on [[https://gitlab.com/o-labs/ppx_deriving_encoding][gitlab]], and
the package can be installed with opam (~opam install ppx_deriving_encoding~).

This ppx allows to derive encoding of json-data-encoding library from most of ocaml types.

Have fun!
      



* OCaml 4.12.0, second beta release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-12-0-second-beta-release/7171/1

** octachron announced


The release of OCaml 4.12.0 is on the horizon. We have created a new beta
version to help you adapt your software to the new features ahead of the release.

Compared to the first beta release, this new release contains one fix for the
Thread library (for a race condition on Windows), and experimentally re-enables
building the compiler on illumos and Oracle Solaris.

We are expecting this beta to be the last one before the release.

If you find any bugs, please report them here:
 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Happy hacking,

-- Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.

*** Installation instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create 4.12.0~beta2 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can pick configuration options with
#+begin_src shell
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.4.12.0~beta2+options,<option_list>
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
where <option_list> is a comma separated list of ocaml-option-* packages. For
instance, for a flambda and afl enabled switch:
#+begin_src shell
opam switch create 4.12.0~beta2+flambda+afl
--packages=ocaml-variants.4.12.0~beta2+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-afl
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_src
All available options can be listed with "opam search ocaml-option".

The source code is available at these addresses:

- https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.12.0-beta2.tar.gz
- https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.12/ocaml-4.12.0~beta2.tar.gz

If you want to test this version, you may want to install the alpha opam repository

https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository

with
#+begin_src shell
opam repo add alpha git://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
#+end_src
This alpha repository contains various packages patched with fixes in the
process of being upstreamed. Once the repository installed, these patched
packages will take precedence over the non-patched version.

*** Changes from the first beta

**** Thread library

- *additional fixes* [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9757][9757]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9846][9846]], +[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10161][10161]]: check proper ownership when operating over mutexes. Now, unlocking a mutex held by another thread or not locked at all reliably raises a Sys_error exception.  Before, it was undefined behavior, but the documentation did not say so. Likewise, locking a mutex already locked by the current thread reliably raises a Sys_error exception.  Before, it could deadlock or succeed (and do recursive locking), depending on the OS. (Xavier Leroy, report by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, David Allsopp, and Stephen Dolan)

**** Build system

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10063][10063]]: (Re-)enable building on illumos (SmartOS, OmniOS, ...) and Oracle Solaris; x86_64/GCC and 64-bit SPARC/Sun PRO C compilers. (partially revert [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/2024][2024]]). (Tõivo Leedjärv and Konstantin Romanov, review by Gabriel Scherer, Sébastien Hinderer and Xavier Leroy)

**** Documentation

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9755][9755]]: Manual: post-processing the html generated by ocamldoc and hevea. Improvements on design and navigation, including a mobile version, and a quick-search functionality for the API. (San Vũ Ngọc, review by David Allsopp and Florian Angeletti)

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10142][10142]], [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10154][10154]]: improved rendering and latex code for toplevel code examples. (Florian Angeletti, report by John Whitington, review by Gabriel Scherer)

#+end_example

See [[https://github.com/daypack-dev/timere/tree/main/examples][here]] for more examples

*** Features
- Timestamp and date time handling with platform independent time zone support
  - Subset of the IANA time zone database is built into this library
- Reasoning over time intervals via timere objects/expressions, examples:
  - Pattern matching time and intervals. These work across DST boundaries.
  - Intersection and union
  - Chunking at year or month boundary, or in fixed sizes
  - Evaluate (sub)expressions with a different time zone (e.g. intersection of 9am to 5pm of Sydney and 9am to 5pm of New York)

Not primarily a programming article but I thought this is an interesting exception because it may be the first time

* json-data-encoding 0.9
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-json-data-encoding-0-9/7157/2

** Raphaël Proust announced


On behalf of Nomadic Labs, it is my pleasure to release json-data-encoding.0.9.1. The code of this packaging-fix
release is identical to the recent json-data-encoding.0.9 but the license information has been corrected.

The previous release had _LGPL with linking exception_ headers in the source files, LICENSE file in the repository,
and license field in the opam file. However, the code was actually under MIT as per agreement of the copyright
holders. Release 0.9.1 has the correct license headers, LICENSE file and license field in the opam files.

The code of 0.9/0.9.1 is in dual license. Future releases will be under MIT license only.
      



* ocamlearlybird 1.0.0 beta1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7

** 文宇祥 announced


I'm pleased to annonce that [[https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird][ocamlearlybird]] 1.0.0~beta1 just released.
Will soon be available on opam.

This is a big step that we toward 1.0.0. We solved lots of issues and tested with realy ocaml projects such as utop,
ocamlformat, and so on. And certainly, it can debug ocamlearlybird itself.

Try yourself!

*** NOTES.
- New version only support OCaml 4.11. If you need other versions support, please let me know.
- Dune-release do not support ~1.0.0~beta1~ version string. So we released 1.0.0 as 1.0.0~beta1 on opam.

*** KNOWN ISSUES:
- Continue run command may hit on last removed breakpoint once when debug utop.

* Cmdliner cheatsheet

** Martin Jambon announced


As a follow-up to [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/what-are-some-libraries-you-almost-always-use/7165/17?u=mjambon][an earlier
conversation]], I made a
[[https://github.com/mjambon/cmdliner-cheatsheet][cheatsheet and a template]] for using cmdliner by @dbuenzli. It was
done quickly and I don't know everything about cmdliner, so please let me know if you see mistakes.
      

** Christian Lindig then said


Good to see this. I believe a common use case is to add are sub commands as popularised by ~git~. It looks like this
in my code:

#+begin_src ocaml
module C = Cmdliner

let report =
  let doc = "generate HTML or JSON report for an outing" in
  let man = ..   in
  C.Term.
    (ret (const make $ common_options $ json $ path), info "report" ~doc ~man)

let default =
  let help = `Help (`Pager, None) in
  let doc = "GPS analysis for rowers" in
 C.Term.(ret @@ const help, info "eightplus" ~doc ~man)

let cmds = [ export; report; topspeed; debug; summary; help ]
let main () = C.Term.(eval_choice default cmds |> exit)
let () = if !Sys.interactive then () else main ()
#+end_src
      

** Martin Jambon later said


I just added a demo/template for subcommand handling. There are now [[https://github.com/mjambon/cmdliner-cheatsheet/tree/main/src][two demo
programs]]. One is focused on the different kinds of
arguments and the other one on subcommands.
      

** Shon also replied


In this same vein, I've been compiling "executable notes" whenever I find myself needing a certain Cmdlner recipe. I
took took these recent discussion as an occasion to document the module a bit: https://github.com/shonfeder/kwdcmd

The aim is to provide "self-documenting" constructors that encode the composition of common CLI terms into module
namespaces, labeled args, and type aliases. The hope being that I can have the type signature of a combinator give me
all the hints I need to avoid having to look up the documentation every time :laughing:

It's just a very rough (and quite imperfect) collection of idioms I've found useful, but it could be worth a look!
When i get a chance, I hope to look through your cheat sheet to make sure I have a representative constructor for
each idiom you've documented.

I'm happy to announce that containers 3.2 has just been
[[https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/releases/tag/v3.2][released]]. It should arrive on opam soon. It notably
contains an ~Either~ compatibility wrapper, more formatting functions, list functions, and a bunch of fixes. Many
thanks to @darrenldl for contributing some initial fuzzing support.

Join us with your questions about the OCaml language, or just to hang out with the OCaml community. Especially geared
toward new and intermediate users, experienced OCaml developers will be available to answer your questions about the
language and ecosystem.

Whether you’re still trying to make sense of currying or can spot non-tail-recursive code from across the room, we
hope that you’ll join us on Thursday, February 11 at 7pm (U.S. Central time). Meeting info and additional details can
be found at [[https://hfpug.org][https://hfpug.org]].

You may be interested in [[https://gitlab.com/camlspotter/cmgraph][cmgraph]] which scrapes the compiled modules
(~*.cmi/*.cmo/*.cmx~) instead of the source code.  It needs no compilation switch options since it does not scrape
source code.
