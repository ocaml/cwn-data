camlid: A library for building C stub generators

François Bobot announced
────────────────────────

  Dear all,

  I'm happy to announce the first release of [camlid] ([documentation]).

  While there are many C stub generators for OCaml, **camlid** takes a
  different approach: it is an OCaml library designed to help you build
  custom C stub generators.

  *Key Comparisons*:

  • Vs. *Ctypes*: Manipulation of C structures stays in C. You don't
    need to replicate C type descriptions in OCaml, keeping the
    compilation and maintenance simple.
  • Vs. *Camlidl/SWIG*: The generator is written in pure OCaml. This
    makes it easier to factorize and customize your bindings without
    resorting to `m4', `sed', or complex external DSLs.

  *Highlighted Features*:

  • *Library-specific initialization*: Easily handle data structure
     setup.
  • *Native Optimization*: supports `unboxed~/~untagged' parameters in
     native mode.
  • *Automated Definitions*: Automatically generates the C/OCaml
     definitions your generated code uses. Referencing a generated C
     function name in your generated OCaml code automatically triggers
     its generation in the C file.
  • *Free Variables*: Generated functions can contain free variables
     that are automatically added as formal parameters. This allows you
     to easily pass a global "context" or "handle" through a generic
     function without manual boilerplate.

  *Example Usage*: Using the built-in helpers, a generator is as simple
   as:

  ┌────
  │ open Camlid
  │ open Helper
  │ 
  │  let () = Generate.to_file
  │     (* Indicates the basename used for the generated files *)
  │     "mylib"
  │     (* Indicates header to include *)
  │     ~headers:["alib.h"]
  │   [
  │     func "f_input" [ input int_trunc];
  │     func "f_output" [ output (ptr_ref int_trunc)];
  │     func "f_with_res" [] ~result:int_trunc;
  │     func "f_no_arg_no_result" [];
  │   ]
  └────

  Only the `mli' of the generated module remains to be written with the
  documentation. For the first function above, the parameter is
  correctly marked as `untagged' (for OCaml versions that support it):

  ┌────
  │ external f_input: (int [@untagged]) -> unit = "camlid_stub_f_input_byte" "camlid_stub_f_input"
  └────

  A more complex example (converting the `flint' binding from Ctypes)
  can be found [here].

  The API is still experimental, and I would love to hear your feedback
  on the organization and naming! The package is already in the opam
  repository.

  (The [modern-ocaml] template is awesome!)

  Hello,

  I would like to announce a new package [restricted].

  This library lets you limit which system operations and which parts of
  the filesystem your program can access. Call it as early as possible
  in your program so that the rest of the code runs with reduced
  privileges. Currently, actual enforced restrictions are implemented
  for these operating systems:

  • OpenBSD

  Even on other operating systems, you can still use `restricted' to
  document which privileges your program needs. Users can then test that
  your program respects these promises with tools such as [pledge on
  Linux]. Enjoy ;)

  • opam: <https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/restricted/>
  • homepage: <https://codeberg.org/removewingman/restricted>
  • Documented Interface and Examples:
    <https://codeberg.org/removewingman/restricted#usage-and-examples>
  • License: [AGPL]

  This is my first ocaml library so feel free to give feedback.

OCaml Security Team 2025 End-Of-Year Report

OCaml Security Team 2025 End-Of-Year Report
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  In May of 2025, the OCaml Software Foundation encouraged the formation
  of an OCaml Security Team, which would handle issues and provide
  guidance for improving software security in the OCaml
  ecosystem. Throughout 2025, the team has been building structure and
  procedures to accomplish these goals. A regular public update on the
  team's activity is among many good ideas taken from the Haskell
  Security Response Team, and we hope the community will find this first
  public update useful.

  The team consists of:

  • Hannes Mehnert - @hannesm - individual, robur.coop
  • Mindy Preston - @yomimono - individual
  • Joe - @cfcs - individual
  • Edwin Török - @edwintorok - individual
  • Nicolás Ojeda Bär - @nojb - LexiFi
  • Louis Roché - @Khady - ahrefs
  • Boning Dong - Bloomberg

  Until December 2025:
  • Maxim Grankin - @maxim092001 - Bloomberg

  The newly created website [ocaml.org/security] gives some guidelines
  for people finding security issues.


[ocaml.org/security] <https://ocaml.org/security>


Contact and Disclosure Process
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The team established a procedure for reporting security issues as one
  of its first activities. The security disclosure process is available
  at
  <https://github.com/ocaml/security-advisories?tab=readme-ov-file#reporting-vulnerabilities>
  . The OCaml Security Team can also be contacted at security@ocaml.org
  for matters besides vulnerability disclosure. Mails to
  security@ocaml.org are not public.

  The public, announce-only mailing list
  <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/ocsf-ocaml-security-announcements>
  will broadcast information on security advisories.

  These procedures were [announced in July 2025].

Vulnerability Database
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A public vulnerability database for OCaml software is another of the
  Security Team's goals. We indend to accomplish this by publishing
  information from the existing, but empty
  <https://github.com/ocaml/security-advisories> to the public [osv.dev]
  database (again borrowing a good idea from the Haskell SRT). Some work
  on a pipeline for publishing advisories there and backporting existing
  advisories is ongoing.


[osv.dev] <https://osv.dev>


Tool development
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  An OCaml library that supports the [package URL] "purl" was developed
  and released to the opam-repository
  (<https://github.com/hannesm/purl>,
  <https://ocaml.org/p/purl/latest>). In the process, we propose to make
  the policy for opam-repository more strict to have immutable packages
  (where the source is not modified):
  <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/29072>. We also propose
  to integrate opam into the package URL specification
  <https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/763>.

  The vulnerability database mentioned above hosts advisories in
  markdown (with some opam-file-format metadata header). We developed
  [tooling] to convert these into json (following the json schema from
  osv.dev). We also made OCaml/opam known for the schema
  <https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/473>.

Public Meetings and Presentations
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  On September 15, Hannes Mehnert gave an introduction to the OCaml
  Security Team at [FUN OCaml] in Warsaw.

  Maxim Grankin gave a talk ["Towards a More Secure OCaml Ecosystem"] at
  the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop in October of 2025, which is
  available at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PekeGxGlc3Q> .

  On October 22 2025, the Security Team held a public meeting, for which
  the notes are available at
  <https://pad.data.coop/7-Ic5rG6ToynsW02hJsndg?both> .

Advisories
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  A potential clickjacking issue with ocurrent's web interface was
  reported to the Security Team by Kunal Mhaske was fixed by Mark Elvers
  in <https://github.com/ocurrent/ocurrent/pull/465> .

  No other communications with the security team have resulted in
  publicly available remediation information or advisories.


Future Plans
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The Security Team has received a lot of interest in the advisory
  database mentioned above, and this work is a high priority for the
  team.

  The Security Team also hopes to publish security guides for OCaml
  programmers and project maintainers.

  The OCaml Software Foundation has indicated that some funding may be
  available for projects that make OCaml more secure. The Security Team
  is actively developing a process for soliciting and evaluating
  proposals, as discussed in the October public meeting.


Acknowledgements

  The Security Team is an initiative of the OCaml Software Foundation
  and is grateful to the OCSF and its sponsors for their support.
