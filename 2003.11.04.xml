    <cwn_title>PERSIL 0.1 - persistent library for Ocaml</cwn_title>
    <cwn_who>Basile Starynkevitch announced</cwn_who>
    <cwn_what>
It is my pleasure to announce the very first alpha release of PERSIL,
a persistent library for Ocaml. It might help you to manage your
persistent data (which survives your program exit and is reused on
next run).

Don't expect too much from this alpha release (Halloween+1)

See http://cristal.inria.fr/~starynke/persil/ for more (source tarball
and tutorial documentation).

A big thanks to all my collegues from Cristal and Moskova teams at
INRIA for their support and their hints.
