** Juneyoung Lee announced


The HOL Light interactive theorem prover written by John Harrison is released to OPAM as a package. Its first new version available on OPAM is 3.0.
It now provides ~hol.sh~ which is a script that will launch an OCaml REPL that enables interactive theorem proving. Combined with a VSCode plugin for HOL Light, this gives a nice theorem proving experience..! For more details, please visit:

* Could we add a tiny OCaml interpreter to Numworks graphical calculators?

** Deep in this thread, Lilian Besson announced


So after a few hours of work, we've successfully ported the OMicroB Virtual Machine for OCaml to the Numworks calculator :tada: ! See [[https://github.com/stevenvar/OMicroB/issues/36#issuecomment-2432041168][this part of our discussion on GitHub]], if anyone is curious.

But we're far away from being done! Indeed, I want to be able to interpret *on the calculator* some OCaml line of code / or entire file.
I know it's probably going to be hard, if not entirely impossible, but hey we've at least progressed a bit in this direction! Thanks @borisd again for the suggestion!
@Vertmo is helping me on this issue, thanks to him.
      



* opam 2.3.0~beta2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3

** Kate announced


We're happy to announce the second beta release of opam 2.3.0.

As we're closing on the final release of opam 2.3.0, we'd be happy for people to test this beta and report any regression.

*** What's new?

This release consists mostly in one regression fix compared to 2.3.0~beta1:

- Fix a regression in the detection of the current terminal size that leads to opam output that tries to fit itself into 80 columns regardless of the current terminal size ([[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/6243][#6243]])

A couple of other improvements were made.
:open_book: You can read our [[https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-3-0-beta2/][blog post]] for more information, and for even more details you can take a look at the [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.3.0-beta2][release note]] or the [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/2.3.0-beta2/CHANGES][changelog]].

*** Try it!

The upgrade instructions are pretty much the same:

For Unix systems
#+begin_example
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh) --version 2.3.0~beta2"
#+end_example
or from PowerShell for Windows systems
#+begin_example
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://opam.ocaml.org/install.ps1) } -Version 2.3.0~beta2"
#+end_example

Please report any issues to [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues][the bug-tracker]].

* Shell Completions in Dune Developer Preview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/shell-completions-in-dune-developer-preview/15522/1

** Steve Sherratt announced


Support for dune shell completions for bash and zsh has just landed in the [[https://preview.dune.build/][Dune Developer Preview]]!

Running the [[https://preview.dune.build/#download][installer]] adds a snippet to your shell config (e.g. ~/.bashrc) that installs a completion handler for ~dune~. The completion script was taken from [[https://github.com/gridbugs/dune-completion-scripts][here]], and that page has some information about how the script was generated. Once it's installed the completions will work any time ~dune~ is typed at the start of a command, so you can still use the completions when running a version of Dune installed with Opam or your system package manager after installing the Dune Developer Preview.

Currently only command completions are supported. So you can run:
#+begin_example
$ dune c<TAB>
cache  clean  coq
#+end_example

...or:
#+begin_example
$ dune build -<TAB>
--action-stderr-on-success
--action-stdout-on-success
--always-show-command-line
--auto-promote
--build-dir
--build-info
--cache
...
#+end_example

But if you run ~dune build <TAB>~ then it will still suggest local files rather than build targets.

*** Try it out!

Getting started is easy:

#+begin_example
$ curl -fsSL https://get.dune.build/install | sh
$ source ~/.bashrc  # or: ~source ~/.zshrc~ or just restart your shell
$ dune <TAB>
build
cache
clean
coq
describe
diagnostics
exec
...
#+end_example
