      <cwn_what>
The second iteration of the online course "Introduction to Functional
Programming in OCaml", aka the OCaml MOOC, starts in a little more than two
weeks, on September 26th.

English and french subtitles are available, and we use a one of a kind
exercise environment fully embedded in the browser that got outstanding
reviews in the first run of this course.

There are already more than 1600 registered to learn OCaml with this MOOC, and
we believe it would be beneficial to our community to attract as many newcomers
as possible, so we have prepared more material to help spread widely the word.
