I released bigstring.0.1 yesterday, a small module for dealing with
bigarrays of chars. It used to be part of containers, but is useful on
its own for low level IO, mirage, etc.; hence the split.  The license is
BSD-2-clauses.

Code, issues, etc. can be found at <a href="https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-bigstring">https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-bigstring</a> ,
and contributions and criticism are welcome.

&gt; With Coccinelle we distribute your Dumper module.
&gt;
&gt; I just noticed that the version we have is quite old and produces
&gt; warnings when compiled.
&gt;
&gt; Is it okay if we distribute a modified version of the code to fix those
&gt; warnings?

Yes.  I'm not sure if it was ever licensed properly, but I'm willing
now to (re?)license it under a liberal 3 clause, no advertising
requirement, BSD license:

  <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:BSD?rd=Licensing/BSD#New_BSD_.28no_advertising.2C_3_clause.29">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:BSD?rd=Licensing/BSD#New_BSD_.28no_advertising.2C_3_clause.29</a>

This is pretty close to "do what you like with it".  I'm CC-ing this
to caml-list to put this in the public record.

&gt; Is there a more recent version of the code available?

Not as far as I know, but if you search for "dumper.mli" you will see
many copies in different places, so I suppose you'll have to go check
if people have added useful features that you want.
      </pre><i>Sébastien Hinderer said, Gabriel Scherer replied, and Richard Jones said:</i><br /><pre>
Sébastien Hinderer:
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think we are fine with what we have, at the moment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So there were two warnings, one about an unused "open Printf" and one
&gt;&gt; about an unused variable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The attached version of the module fixes them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I may also get rid of the "open Obj" statement and qualify all the
&gt;&gt; references to this module as I fnd this style more clear.

Gabriel Scherer:
&gt; This "dump" code has lived on in Extlib (to which Richard
&gt; participated, I believe), and is also part of Batteries. I know that
&gt; ygrek, Extlib's current maintainers, has done some fixes to it (I
&gt; think we ported them into Batteries), so you may want to look there.

Richard Jones:
Ah I see you are right.  I actually checked extlib before posting
that, but forgot that it was not a standalone module but added to the
'Std' module, here:

<a href="https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib/blob/master/src/std.ml">https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib/blob/master/src/std.ml</a>

What I said about the licensing of my contributions still applies
(also 3 clause BSD &amp; LGPL are compatible, so that's fine).
