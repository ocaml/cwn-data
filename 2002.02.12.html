1) BEGINNERS' LIST ocaml_beginners@yahoogroups.com IS SET!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ernesto T. Succu announced:

OCAML BEGINNERS' LIST ocaml_beginners@yahoogroups.com IS SET.

Here is the public description so far:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This list is a place for the mutual aid of those who recognize that they're
not ocaml gurus yet... everything you wanted to ask about Ocaml, but were
afraid to ask in the very official caml-list@inria.fr, can be asked, answered
and discussed here.
Satisfaction is NOT guaranteed and if you are teaching more than you're
learning... please think that you've probably learnt more than you're
teaching! :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The list is
        listed in yahoogroups directory
        accessible through <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners</a>
        unmoderated
        open
        with no attachments
        with member posting and public archives

To subscribe:
        yahoogroups suggests to send a message to
                ocaml_beginners-subscribe@yahoogroups.com
        but
        in case this fails (well, they're not using ocaml apparently)
        the second way is to go and visit <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com">http://www.yahoogroups.com</a>
        and create an account (well, euh, personal infos are collected) ,
        then subscribe
        OR
        mail the list-owner (at present, me) at stalkern2@tin.it
        and ask for subscribing.

To unsubscribe:
        your e-mail address is supposed to have subscribed (see above and wait for
your confirmation message)
