After an 'opam update', you should be able to see the dolog package.

Here is its minimalistic interface definition:
---
type log_level = FATAL | ERROR | WARN | INFO | DEBUG

val set_log_level : log_level -&gt; unit
val set_output : out_channel -&gt; unit

val fatal : string Lazy.t -&gt; unit

Got some time scratching my head over this little puzzle.
Consider this bog-standard ackermann code :

let rec ack m n =
  match m, n with
  | 0,n -&gt; n+1
  | m,0 -&gt; ack (m-1) 1
  | m,n -&gt; ack (m-1) (ack m (n-1))
in let _ = ack 4 1 ()

One could also pass m and n as a tuple. Also the call to the actual computation
can be a toplevel let or not.  All in all 4 variants. Can you predict what will
be the performance and what is the difference (if any) in generated code?

All code and Makefile is attached.

Running `make bench` here consistently gives the following (ack1, ack3 - tuples,
ack2, ack4 - curried) :

ack1.ml
0:03.85

ack2.ml
0:04.70

ack3.ml
0:04.60

ack4.ml
0:03.85

Tested with 3.12.1 and 4.00.1 (ack4 becomes slower).

Moreover, the generated assembly code for the main loop is the same, afaics.
The only difference is the initialization of structure fields and the initial
call to ack. Please can anybody explain the performance difference? I understand
that microbenchmarks are no way the basis to draw performance conclusions upon,
but I cannot explain these results to myself in any meaninful way.
Please help! :)

As others said, probably code placement. A good tool to explore these
issues under Linux is "perf", in particular "perf stats", which lets
you count various hardware events. Running it on your 4 programs,
you'll see that the number of instructions executed is almost exactly
the same, but the branch mispredictions (for instance) vary
significantly, in a way correlated with the overall execution time.

(Note that this doesn't have anything to do with OCaml: you'd observe
crazy variations like these with any compiled language.)

&gt; I understand that microbenchmarks are no way the basis to draw
&gt; performance conclusions upon, but I cannot explain these results to
&gt; myself in any meaninful way.

Nobody can except perhaps a few engineers at Intel or AMD who have the
whole microarchitecture of their processors imprinted in their heads.
(And then they will not tell you.) See, modern microarchitectures
contain so many clever heuristics that performance is generally very
good but essentially unpredictable...

The OCaml-Java is a project whose goal is to allow compilation
of OCaml sources to Java bytecode, thus allowing execution on
any JVM. The objectives are to gain access to a greater number
of libraries, and to be able to take advantage of multiple cores.

A new binary release of OCaml-Java has just been published,
with an enhanced version of the "concurrent" library. The library
features many different abstractions over concurrent computations:
atomics, futures, fork/join, map/reduce, STM, etc. An introduction
to the library can be found at the following address:
<a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/concurrency.html">http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/concurrency.html</a>
while general information about the project, and download links
can be reached at the following address:
<a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/">http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/</a>

I am looking for testers of the OCaml-Java project at large, and
of the concurrent library in particular. So, if you are interested in
OCaml multicore programming, just give it a try and give feedback
(either here, by private mail, or through the bugtracker available
at <a href="http://bugs.x9c.fr">http://bugs.x9c.fr</a>). Thanks in advance.

Some of you may already be aware of PR#5985
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5985">http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5985</a>

To explain very shortly what is happening, a bug was found in the ocaml
compiler, both 4.00 and the development version, such that one that
convert a value from any type to any other type, bypassing all checks.
This is what we call a soundness bug, a hole in the type system.

Such problems happen at times, and we are usually very fast to fix them.
However this time the problem is bit more subtle, because fixing it
straightforwardly may make impossible to write a whole category of
GADTs. Hence this request for feedback.

Practical description of the problem:

It is quite usual to write type witnesses using a GADT:

type _ ty =
  | Int : int ty
  | Pair : 'a ty * 'b ty -&gt; ('a * 'b) ty
  | Hashtbl : 'a ty * 'b ty -&gt; ('a, 'b) Hashtbl.t ty

This looks fine, but now suppose that we write the following code:

module F (X : sig type 'a t end) = struct
   type _ ty =
    | Int : int ty
    | Pair : 'a ty * 'b ty -&gt; ('a * 'b) ty
    | T : 'a ty -&gt; 'a X.t ty
end

The idea is to create a type witness with the
type constructor X.t instead of Hashtbl.t.
Now I can use it this way:

module U = struct type 'a t = unit end
module M = F(U)
let w = M.T M.Int
(* val w : int U.t M.ty *)
let w' = match w with M.T x -&gt; x | _ -&gt; assert false
(* val w' : '_a M.ty = M.Int *)

What this means is that we can now give an arbitrary type
to a witness for int. You can easily use it to build a function
from int to any  type:

let f : type a. a M.ty -&gt; int -&gt; a =
  fun w x -&gt; match w with M.Int -&gt; x | _ -&gt; assert false;;
let g : int -&gt; float = f w';;

If we look at the source of the problem, it lies in the fact U.t is not injective.
I.e. when we define a GADT, we assume that all the type variables in
the return type can be determined from the type parameter.
That is, from (int U.t M.ty) we assume that the type of the argument of T is (int M.ty).
However, since U.t is not injective, int U.t is actually equal to any type 'a U.t,
and we can convert.
Note that, for known types, injectivity was already checked.
I.e., the following definition is not accepted:

type _ ty =
  | Int : int ty
  | Pair : 'a ty * 'b ty -&gt; ('a * 'b) ty
  | T : 'a ty -&gt; 'a U.t ty

However, abstract types were assumed to be injective.
Here we see that you cannot take this for granted.

The problem is of course not limited to type witnesses, and not even GADTs:
types with constrained parameters (introduced at the very beginning of ocaml),
can also trigger it.
And you don't need a functor to trigger it: once you know that two types are equal
in some scope, there are many ways to leak that information.

=============================
Here comes the request for feedback:

The fix is simple enough: we should track injectivity, and assume that abstract
types are not injective by default.
However, this also means that the first type I defined above (using Hashtbl.t)
will be refused.

How many of you are using GADTs in this way, and how dependent are you on
abstract types ?


If we need to be able to define GADTs relying on the injectivity of some abstract
types, a straightforward solution is to add injectivity annotations on type parameters,
the same way it was done for variance:

  type #'a t

would mean that t is injective.
This is implemented in branches/non-vanishing, in the subversion repository.
	svn checkout <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/svn/branches/non-vanishing">http://caml.inria.fr/svn/branches/non-vanishing</a>
Note that in that branch Hashtbl.t in the standard library is marked as injective.
This introduces some new syntax, and libraries have to be modified to benefit,
so the question is do we really need it?


Jacques Garrigue

P.S.
If you are curious about other difficulties of GADTs, the is also branches/abstract-new
which introduces a notion of new types, either concrete or abstract, which are guaranteed
to be distinct from each other, and any other concrete type. This is useful when
checking the exhaustiveness of pattern-matching, as we can then discard impossible
branches. That branch is completely experimental.
      </pre><i>Among many replies, Jacques Garrigue said:</i><br /><pre>
First, let me reiterate my request for feedback:

What I want to know is whether anybody is using GADTs in a way that would be
broken if we disallow type variables under abstract types (other than the
predefined ones) in the return type of GADTs.  I.e., for instance defining a
type witness type involving such abstract types.

This is really the question I want you all to answer.

If this is not the case, we can safely prohibit that at this point, and take
our time to think about the solution.

But if there are some users, we had better provide at least some mechanism,
and injectivity annotations seem to be the less intrusive (they don't
break any code, at least any existing code).
We may need to make clear that they are experimental and might
disappear, but at least we are not in a complete void.

Now just my 2 centimes on alternative approaches

Alain Frisch wrote:

&gt; Jacques Le Normand wrote:
&gt; &gt; Fully injective types are the norm. It would have been nice to have a
&gt; &gt; "non injectivity" or "phantom type" annotation. Since phantom types are
&gt; &gt; seldom used, beginners won't get confused. It might even help beginners
&gt; &gt; understand the concept of a phantom type.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd also prefer an annotation on "non injective" type parameters, rather than
&gt; on "injective" one.  The problem with this approach is that it requires existing
&gt; well-typed code to be rewritten, to add these annotations (while annotating
&gt; injectivity will only impact code using GADTs).  I still believe this is less
&gt; intrusive than requiring most parametrized abstract type to be annotated, or
&gt; else making GADTs less useful.

This may be a good idea for 5.00, but honestly this is a big change.

Moreover it is not so clear that this is the right choice for functors:
when a functor takes an abstract type as argument, it usually doesn't care
whether it is injective or not. And in practice there is a technique of adding
a type parameter to abstract types just in case we want to pass a parameterized
type, but usually using this functor for non-parameterized types.

Another point is that I'm not sure how much "less useful" GADTs become when one
forgets an injectivity annotation somewhere.

&gt; For the transition, we could have two compilation modes (decided on the
&gt; command-line) for this feature.  In "non-injective" (legacy) mode, every
&gt; parametrized abstract type would be assumed to be non-injective.  This would
&gt; allow to compile existing code bases (at least those not relying on GADTs).  In
&gt; "injective-by-default" mode, non-injective parameters would need to be marked as
&gt; such.  Enabling this mode will require a few annotations to be added to existing
&gt; code, but this will be very easy, so I guess we don't need to support
&gt; "injectivity" annotations the "non-injective" mode.

Again, the defect of such a mode is that it is going to apply to everything,
including functors.  A functor compiled in this mode might be not be applicable
to some modules, whereas there was no reason from the beginning to require
injectivity there.

And just using variance to change the behavior is not going to work well:
a standard practice is to explicitly define module types for the input and output of
the functor. We want the output types to be injective, but we don't really need such
requirement for the input types. But they are just module type definitions…
(See hashtbl.mli for instance for this pattern.)
      </pre><i>Nathan Mishra Linger replied and Jacques Garrigue said:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Our codebase at Jane Street would not suffer from the proposed fix.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, we have previously wished the type system tracked injectivity of type
&gt; constructors.  Because it didn't, we wrote Type_equal.Injective [^1] for cases
&gt; when we need to track injectivity ourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; [^1] <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core/Type_equal.Injective.html">https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/core/Type_equal.Injective.html</a>

Thank you for the pointer.

One could say this actually shows the need for injectivity annotations
(eventhough Core currently works around them).

To be more precise, injectivity has several uses:

1) To allow you to infer equations between types.
   For instance, assuming the standard equality witness type:

	type (_,_) equal = Eq : ('a,'a) equal

   the following function typeckecks

        let conv1 : type a b. (a array, b array) equal -&gt; a -&gt; b = fun Eq x -&gt; x

   because array is known to be injective, but  this one doesn't

	let conv2 : type a b. (a Queue.t, b Queue.t) equal -&gt; a -&gt; b = fun Eq x -&gt; x

   because Queue.t is an abstract type whose injectivity is unknown.

   This part was correctly handled since 4.00.0.

2) To allow you to prove exhaustiveness of pattern matching, by ensuring
   that other cases cannot happen. For instance,

	type (_,_) comp =
	  | Ceq : ('a,'a) comp
	  | Cany : ('a,'b) comp

	let f (x : (int array,bool array) comp) = match x with Cany -&gt; ()
       
   causes no warning, because the type system can prove that Ceq since
   int array and bool array cannot be equal in any scope. However

	let f (x : (int Queue.t, bool Queue.t) comp) = match x with Cany -&gt; 0

   should emit a warning, because we cannot prove that int Queue.t and
   bool Queue.t are distinct in the absence of injectivity information.
   Note that this is not correctly handled in 4.00, and you will get no warning
   in this situation. Worse, since the code is optimized accordingly (i.e. no
   runtime check is introduced), if the type is really not injective, and you
   pass Eq, you can use this as a hole in the type system.
   This now works correctly in trunk (PR#5981).

3) The problem I describe in my first mail. I.e. when defining a type,
   if you use type variables appearing in constrained type parameters,
   you need the type constructors leading to the type variables to be
   injective. This is PR#5985, and it is only fixed in branches/non-vanishing.

The goal of the Type_equal.Injective interface in Core  is to work around the
limitation on abstract types in (1), by letting you prove injectivity by hand.
But if we had injectivity annotations, this would solve simultaneously all 3
problems: no need to build proofs by hand anymore.

So I understand you answer as: Jane Street is not directly concerned by
(3) at this point, and has already developed a workaround for (1).
I suppose you could profit from injectivity annotations, since you had
to develop a workaround, but this may not be that urgent.

(2) is not so much a problem, since it only means that you may have to
add extra cases to pattern-matching.
      </pre><i>Jacques Garrigue then said:</i><br /><pre>
I have now committed in trunk a fix to PR#5985.
You can use it to test whether your codebase runs into problems.
You can either obtain it from subversion directly
svn checkout <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/trunk">http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/trunk</a>
or use opam to do it for you.

I checked that at least Core itself compiles without problems.

Again, if you run into problems, you can try branches/non-vanishing,
which allows you to annotate some abstract types are injective.
