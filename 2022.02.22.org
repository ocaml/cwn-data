** Florian said


It seems that silently OCAML is now  entering the Quantum world.
It looks that the  Interpreter for "Twist"
[[https://scitechdaily.com/twist-mits-new-programming-language-for-quantum-computing/][New programming language for Quantum
computing]]
is made with OCAML:
[[https://github.com/psg-mit/twist-popl22][GitHub for Twist]]
      

** Anton Kochkov then added


Haskell has a nice package for quantum computing - Quipper. I recommend to take a look to it for inspiration as well:
- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quipper-language
- http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3390.pdf
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03522.pdf (a new language that reuses linear types in the Haskell to represent quantum specifics during the Quipper type check)
      



* Layout Parsing and Nicely Formatted Error Messages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-layout-parsing-and-nicely-formatted-error-messages/9343/1

** Hbr announced


In a previous [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/my-way-from-lalr-parsing-to-combinator-parsing/7377][post]] I have
described my way from LALR parsing to combinator
parsing. Now I am more and more convinced that combinator parsing is really a
good and flexible way to write parsers. The new release 0.5.0 of `Fmlib` focuses
on layout parsing and nicely formatted error messages by using combinator
parsing.

The library can be installed via opam by ~opam install fmlib~. There is a [[https://github.com/hbr/fmlib][github
repository]] hosting the source code. The
[[https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/index.html][API]] can be found online. See also
a [[https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/parse.html][tutorial]] on combinator parsing.

*** Layout Parsing

Most programming languages express hierarchical structures by some kind of
parentheses. Algol like languages use ~begin~ ~end~, C like languages use curly
braces ~{~, ~}~ to enclose blocks of code. Since blocks can be nested inside
blocks, the hierarchical or tree structure is well expressed by the syntax.

For the human reader blocks are usually indented to make the hierarchical
structure graphically visible. Programming languages like *Haskell* and
*Python* ommit the parentheses and express the hierarchical structure by
indentation. I.e. the indentation is part of the grammar. This is pleasing to
the eye, because many parentheses can be ommitted.

The hierarchical structure in the following schematical source file is
immediately visible without the need of parentheses.

#+begin_example
    xxxxxxxxxxx
        xxx
        xxx
            xxxxxxx
    xxxxxxxx
        xxx
#+end_example

Lower level blocks are indented with respect to their parent block and siblings
at the same level are vertically aligned.

Because of this good readability configuration languages like yaml have
become very popular.

Unfortunately there are not many parsers available which support indentation
sensitivity. The library [[https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_parse/Fmlib_parse/index.html][Fmlib]] has support to
parse languages whose grammar uses indentation to structure blocks hierarchically.

There are only 3 combinators needed to introduce layout parsing in combinator
parsing. Suppose that ~p~ is a combinator parsing a certain contruct. Then we
have

- ~indent 4 p~: Parse the construct described by ~p~ indented at least 4
  columns relative to its environment

- ~align p~: Parse the construct desribed by ~p~ aligned vertically with its
  siblings

- ~detach p~: Parse the construct described by ~p~ without any indentation or
  alignment restrictions

In order to parse a list of ~p~s vertically aligned and indented relative to its
environment by at least one column we just write

#+begin_src ocaml
    one_or_more (align p) |> indent 1
#+end_src

and parse a structure with the schematic layout

#+begin_example
    xxxxxxxx

        pppppppp

        pppppp

        pppp

    xxxxx
#+end_example

*** User Frienly Error Messages

It is important to for a parser writer to make syntax error messages user
friendly. [[https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_pretty/Fmlib_pretty/index.html][Fmlib]] has some support to write
friendly error messages. There is the operator ~<?>~ copied from the Haskell library ~parsec~ which helps to equip
combinators with descriptive error message in case they fail to parse the construct successfully.

At the end of a failed parsing, the syntax (or semantic) errors have to be
presented to the user. Suppose there is a combinator parser for a yaml like
structure. The library writes by default for you error messages in the form

#+begin_example
    1 |
    2 | names:
    3 |      - Alice
    3 |      - Bob
    4 |
    5 |   category: encryption
          ^

    I have encountered something unexpected. I was
    expecting one of

        - at 3 columns after

            - sequence element: "- <yaml value>"

        - at 2 columns before

            - key value pair: "<key>: <yaml value>"

        - end of input
#+end_example

The raw information (line and column numbers, individual expectations, failed
indentation or alignment expectation) is available as well so that you can
present the error messages to the user in any different form.

There is also a component [[https://hbr.github.io/fmlib/odoc/fmlib_pretty/Fmlib_pretty/index.html][Fmlib_pretty]] in
the library for pretty printing any ascii text.
      



* ptime 1.0.0 and mtime 1.4.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ptime-1-0-0-and-mtime-1-4-0/9344/1

** Daniel Bünzli announced


It's my pleasure to announce new releases of ptime and mtime. Ptime and mtime provide types and clocks for POSIX and
monotonic time.

These releases change the JavaScript support strategy for clocks by implementing the primitives in pure JavaScript
and linking them via ~js_of_ocaml~.

This means that both the ~ptime.clock.jsoo~ and ~mtime.clock.jsoo~ libraries no longer exist[^1]. Instead simply use
the ~ptime.clock.os~ or ~mtime.clock.os~ libraries like you would do for your regular programs.

By side effect, the packages also no longer depend on any of  ~js_of_ocaml~'s packages.

Thanks to Hugo Heuzard (@hhugo) for suggesting and implementing these changes. Thanks also to Jonah Beckford for his
Windows build patches.

Other changes are described in the release notes for [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/ptime/blob/master/CHANGES.md#v100-2022-02-16-la-forclaz][~ptime~]] and [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/mtime/blob/master/CHANGES.md#v140-2022-02-17-la-forclaz-vs][~mtime~]].

Home pages:  [[https://erratique.ch/software/ptime][ptime]], [[https://erratique.ch/software/mtime][mtime]]

Docs & manuals: [[https://erratique.ch/software/ptime/doc][ptime]], [[https://erratique.ch/software/mtime/doc][mtime]] or
~odig doc ptime mtime~

Install: ~opam install ptime mtime~

[^1]: I had intended to only deprecate these libraries by ~warning~ in the ~META~ files and requiring the replacement library but it seems the warning won't show up in many contexts including ~dune~ builds. So a breaking change it is.
      



* Timedesc 0.6.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-timedesc-0-6-0/9349/1

** Darren announced


I am pleased to announce the release of [[https://github.com/daypack-dev/timere][Timedesc]] 0.6.0.

* OCaml from the Very Beginning now free in PDF and HTML formats
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-from-the-very-beginning-now-free-in-pdf-and-html-formats/9361/1

** John Whitington announced


Thanks to a grant from the [[https://ocaml-sf.org/][OCaml Software Foundation]], I am able to release my book [[https://ocaml-book.com][OCaml
from the Very Beginning]] at no cost in its existing PDF format, and in a new HTML format too.

You can find it here:
[[https://johnwhitington.net/ocamlfromtheverybeginning/][https://johnwhitington.net/ocamlfromtheverybeginning/]].

The paperback and Kindle versions continue to be available from Amazon as before.

The book has recently been updated to make it ready for OCaml 4.14 which involved only minor changes to error
handling and warnings. I have also opened the [[https://github.com/johnwhitington/mlbook][source]].
      



* Dune 3.0.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-0-0/9374/1

** Rudi Grinberg announced


On behalf of the dune team, I’m delighted to announce the availability of dune 3.0.

The team has been working on this release for over 6 months, and there’s a bunch of new work to report. I’ll only
highlight the some of the interesting new developments:

- The watch mode has been rewritten from scratch to be faster and more scalable. We also no longer rely on any 3rd party tools such as fswatch. If any of you still have a dune workspace dune is still struggling with, we cannot wait to hear from you.

- The watch mode now also starts an RPC server in the background. This RPC protocol is going to be the basis for other tools to interact with dune. Watch out for announcement on the LSP side to see how we’ll be making use of it to improve the editing experience.

- The dune cache has been rewritten as well. It is now simpler and more reliable. There are still some components missing, such as distribution of the artifacts on the network. Nevertheless, we welcome you all to experiment with this feature and give us feedback.

- We’ve addressed one of our oldest feature requests: high level rules for ctypes projects. This feature is still experimental, so we need feedback from real world projects before declaring it as mature.

Of course, there are many other fixes, enhancements, and only a few breaking changes in this release. We hope you
have an easy time upgrading.

Happy Hacking.

* Packstream 0.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-packstream-0-1/9392/1

** Tomasz Barański announced


I have a pleasure to announce the release of [[https://github.com/tomob/packstream][Packstream]] 0.1.

Packstream is a library to parse/serialize [[https://7687.org/packstream/packstream-specification-1.html][Packstream binary
format]].

This is the initial release. It is functional but very very limited in scope. It allows parsing a binary stream into
a Packstream datatype and serializing the datatype into a binary stream.
      



* OCaml 4.14.0, first beta release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-14-0-first-beta-release/9396/1

** octachron announced


The release of OCaml 4.14.0 is close.

The set of new features has been stabilized, and most opam packages already
work with this release. After two alpha releases, we have created a first
beta version to help you update your softwares and libraries ahead of the
release.

If you find any bugs, please report them at:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

The full release of OCaml 4.14.0 is currently expected for the middle of March.

Compared to the last alpha, we have  a last minute correction for one of the new
function in the Seq module, some documentation improvements, few configuration
and internal tweaks.

*** Installation instructions
The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.0~beta1 --repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_example
With opam 2.1, the previous command line can be simplified to
#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create 4.14.0~beta1
#+end_example
If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=ocaml-variants.4.14.0~beta1+options,<option_list>
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_example
or with opam 2.1:
#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.4.14.0~beta1+options <option_list>
#+end_example

where ~<option_list>~ is a comma separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a flambda and
no-flat-float-array switch:
#+begin_example
opam switch create 4.14.0~beta1+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.4.14.0~beta1+options ocaml-option-flambda
ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_example
All available options can be listed with ~opam search ocaml-option~.

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

- https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.14.0-beta1.tar.gz
- https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.14/ocaml-4.14.0~beta1.tar.gz
