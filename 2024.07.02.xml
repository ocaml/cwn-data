      <cwn_title>New release of Ocsipersist</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-ocsipersist/14874/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Vincent Balat announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
[Ocsipersist](https://ocsigen.org/ocsipersist/) has been recently updated.

Ocsipersist is an OCaml interface for key-value stores, with three implementations based on SQLite, DBM and PostgreSQL.

It proposes several interfaces: basic string to string tables, typed tables with custom (de)serialisation functions, persistent variables ...

This new version 2.0.0, adds the following features:
 * some dependencies removed
 * Basic interface for persistent references, in the style of Eliom's [scoped references](https://ocsigen.org/eliom/latest/api/server/Eliom_reference) (but without scope)

Example of use of persistent references from the toplevel, with the sqlite backend:
#+begin_example
# #require "lwt_ppx";;
(* #thread;; if you are using OCaml &lt; 5.0.0 *)
# #require "ocsipersist-sqlite";;
# Ocsipersist.init ();;
# let r = Ocsipersist.Ref.ref ~persistent:"r" 444;;
val r : int Ocsipersist.Ref.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Lwt_main.run (let%lwt v = Ocsipersist.Ref.get r in print_int v; Lwt.return_unit);;
444- : unit = ()
#+end_example

Backends:
Choose the backend you prefer by using packages ~ocsipersist-sqlite~, ~ocsipersist-dbm~ or ~ocsipersist-postgresql~.

Configuration:
 * Use module ~Ocsipersist_settings~, provided by each backend to configure the database
 * Opam packages  ~ocsipersist-sqlite-config~, ~ocsipersist-dbm-config~ or ~ocsipersist-postgresql-config~ make it possible to configure the backend from Ocsigen Server's config file (breaking change: this was provided by ~ocsipersist-sqlite~, ~ocsipersist-dbm~ or ~ocsipersist-postgresql~ before. You'll need to update your configuration files).

      <cwn_title>Preview of Godotcaml for the Godot 4.2 Game Engine</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-preview-of-godotcaml-for-the-godot-4-2-game-engine/14875/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Matt Walker announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I've released a small preview of a project I've been working on.  It's bindings to the Godot 4.2 game engine from OCaml.

To keep this announcement short, I've posted a longer explanation on my blog:

https://fizzixnerd.com/blog/2024-06-24-announcing-godotcaml/

Here is the git repo:

https://github.com/Fizzixnerd/godotcaml

Here is another short blog post explaining how to get up and started with it:

https://fizzixnerd.com/blog/2024-06-28-godotcaml-basic-setup/

Do not expect much, I've basically just reached the point where Godot and OCaml can call each other.  I just thought people might think it's cool!  Open issues or discuss in this thread if you'd like; another blog post will be forthcoming covering the current structure of the code if there seems to be interest.

It is my pleasure to announce the release of Euler version 0.3. :slight_smile:

Euler is an arithmetic library for OCaml integers. For more details, please read *[the repo](https://github.com/gmevel/euler-lib)*​’s README or browse *[the docs](https://gmevel.github.io/euler-lib/index.html/euler/Euler/index.html)*.

In version 0.3:
- some amount of optimization (:magic_wand: magic tricks to compute logarithms, see source code of [~log2sup~](https://github.com/gmevel/euler-lib/blob/0.3/src/Arith.ml#L621-L695) and [~logsup~](https://github.com/gmevel/euler-lib/blob/0.3/src/Arith.ml#L697-L750));
- new functions (for instance: root extraction, multiplicative order);
- ~Arith.gcdext~ now returns minimal coefficients and avoids overflows (which was [not trivial](https://github.com/gmevel/euler-lib/blob/0.3/src/Arith.ml#L1390-L1514));
- factorization now performs some steps of Fermat’s factor searching, which I think closes the gap with [Owl](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl) (mentioning this because @struktured [had asked me](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-euler-an-arithmetic-library-for-native-integers/12482/9) how Euler compared with Owl, and Fermat’s algorithm was the only integer arithmetic operation that I found in Owl not provided by Euler).

The full list of changes is found in the changelog, in the repo.

Happy factorizing!

(This is a new topic because I cannot edit [the initial one](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-euler-an-arithmetic-library-for-native-integers/12482).)

We're happy to announce the release of Dune 3.16.0.

Among the list of chances, this release contains improvements to melange support and a way to look for references in a whole project using merlin and ocaml-lsp.

*3.16.0 (2024-06-17)*

*** Added

- allow libraries with the same ~(name ..)~ in projects as long as they don't conflict during resolution (via ~enabled_if~). (#10307, @anmonteiro, @jchavarri)

- ~dune describe pp~ now finds the exact module and the stanza it belongs to, instead of guessing the name of the preprocessed file. (#10321, @anmonteiro)

- Print the result of ~dune describe pp~ with the respective dialect printer. (#10322, @anmonteiro)

- Add new flag ~--context~ to ~dune ocaml-merlin~, which allows to select a Dune context when requesting Merlin config. Add ~dune describe contexts~ subcommand. Introduce a field ~generate_merlin_rules~ for contexts declared  in the workspace, that allows to optionally produce Merlin rules for other  contexts besides the one selected for Merlin (#10324, @jchavarri)

- melange: add include paths for private library ~.cmj~ files during JS  emission. (#10416, @anmonteiro)

- ~dune ocaml-merlin~: communicate additional directives ~SOURCE_ROOT~,  ~UNIT_NAME~ (the actual name with wrapping) and ~INDEX~ with the paths to the  index(es). (#10422, @voodoos)

- Add a new alias ~@ocaml-index~ that uses the ~ocaml-index~ binary to generate  indexes that can be read by tools such as Merlin to provide project-wide  references search. (#10422, @voodoos)

- merlin: add optional ~(merlin_reader CMD)~ construct to ~(dialect)~ stanza to  configure a merlin reader (#8567, @andreypopp)

*** Changed

- melange: treat private libraries with ~(package ..)~ as public libraries,  fixing an issue where ~import~ paths were wrongly emitted. (#10415,  @anmonteiro)

- install ~.glob~ files for Coq theories too (#10602, @ejgallego)

*** Fixed

- Don't try to document non-existent libraries in doc-new target (#10319, fixes  #10056, @jonludlam)

- Make ~dune-site~'s ~load_all~ function look for ~META~ files so that it  doesn't fail on empty directories in the plugin directory (#10458, fixes  #10457, @shym)

- Fix incorrect warning for libraries defined inside non-existant directories  using ~(subdir ..)~ and used by executables using ~dune-build-info~ (#10525,  @rgrinberg)

- Don't try to take build lock when running ~coq top --no-build~ (#10547, fixes  #7671, @lzy0505)

- Make sure to truncate dune's lock file after locking and unlocking so that  users cannot observe incorrect pid's (#10575, @rgrinberg)

- mdx: link mdx binary with ~byte_complete~. This fixes ~(libraries)~ with  foreign archives on Linux. (#10586, fixes #10582, @anmonteiro)

- virtual libraries: fix an issue where linking an executable involving several  virtual libries would cause an error. (#10581, fixes #10460, @rgrinberg)
