I would like to draw your attention to phphard project, which is a PHP
source code static analyzer. Its aim is to strong type PHP programs and
detect as many bugs at compile time as possible.

The project is in its very early stage: most of PHP parsing is done
(using ocamllex + ocamlyacc), some pretty printing is done, no real
source code analysis is done. It is now hosted here:

<a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/phphard/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/phphard/</a>
<a href="https://github.com/sfindeisen/phphard">https://github.com/sfindeisen/phphard</a> (source code)

I will welcome your ideas, feedback and contributions to the project.
This is something I had been working on for some time, but have no
resources (time+money) to finish this alone.

I thinks it still makes sense to use PHP for web development as LAMP
stack is quite efficient compared to some other stacks like Java. :)
Plus there is lots of existing PHP code.

I must confess that I have only superficially scanned through existing
solutions to this static analysis problem. Some of the existing software
(like HipHop VM from Facebook) seems quite complex, however I couldn't
find anything that would be:

* exactly scoped on PHP + static analysis
* written in a functional language.

Therefore I think this project has a potential and working on it can
bring you glory. :)

I believe purely functional style (non-modifiable data structures!) will
be beneficial in this application.

If you want to contribute please join the project on OCaml Forge. The
source code is now on GitHub and it seems cool to me (but we can discuss
that if you have arguments).

&gt; I am aware of several implementation for IPv4 packet parsing
&gt; (ocaml-packet, melange, promiwag and maybe others that I missed).
&gt; However, up to my knowledge, none of these implementations offer IPv6
&gt; parsing functionnalities.
&gt; I would like to know if there is anything available ?

Using bitstring makes parsing binary structures such as IPv6 (and IPv4)
packets easy:

IPv6 is on the TODO list for robinet[1], a small lib that parse
network traffic (with the help of bitstring which was already
suggested). It's hard to tell if this small library fits your use
case but if it does I'd gladly add support for IPv6.

&gt; &gt; &gt; One feature I'd really like to see in Bitstring is support for Bigarray,
&gt; &gt; &gt; since that avoids a copy into the OCaml heap and lets us do quite high
&gt; &gt; &gt; performance parsing.  If I remember right, there was a patch on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bitstring issue tracker, but it wasn't parameterised (so it's either
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bistring+string or Bitstring+bigarray, which isn't ideal).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pardon my lack of familiarity with bigarrays, but I can't see what's the
&gt; &gt; difference between copying packets from pcap ring buffer into a bigarray
&gt; &gt; or into a string. Or do you mean using Bigarray.map_file on the whole
&gt; &gt; raw ring buffer and handle it without pcap help?

Without knowing details: maybe no copy is required at all? The pcap ring
buffer could be directly wrapped as Bigarray.

&gt; We have a number of use-cases that run OCaml in kernel mode, directly
&gt; operating on packets read from a network driver that's also written in
&gt; OCaml.  Bigarrays are used as the mechanism for passing around externally
&gt; allocated memory (i.e. network card buffers) directly, whereas inspecting
&gt; them with a string-based Bigarray requires an expensive data copy.
&gt; 
&gt; See: <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf</a>
&gt; or <a href="http://www.openmirage.org">http://www.openmirage.org</a>

For similar reasons, I also added some Bigarray functions to Ocamlnet:

<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.7.3/doc/html-main/Netsys_mem.html">http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.7.3/doc/html-main/Netsys_mem.html</a>

If you look at the stub behind e.g. Unix.read, you'll see that the data
is first read into an internal unaligned buffer, and then copied to the
string buffer. This means usually two copies of the data: one from the
kernel buffer to the internal buffer, and one from there to the string.

If you use a Bigarray instead the internal buffer becomes superfluous:
Bigarrays are malloc'ed memory, and cannot be moved by the GC. Hence,
you can invoke the read() syscall directly with the Bigarray as buffer.
If you additionally ensure that the Bigarray is page-aligned, the kernel
can sometimes even avoid copying at all (though only some OS seem to
implement such a strategy, as changing the page mapping or doing some
direct I/O can be more costly than copying).

Another advantage here is that you can freely choose the size of the
buffer (Unix.read et al use fixed-size 64K for the internal buffer).
Also you can allocate the buffer in a shared area.

Ocamlnet now prefers Bigarrays as primary buffers where reasonable, and
where a speedup (or lower CPU consumption) can be expected. E.g. The
HTTP client first reads data into a bigarray, splits the header there
into lines (which are then normal strings again), and gathers the data
chunks from the HTTP body (which can be strings or Bigarrays, at the
user's choice).

&gt; Ideally, I'd like to pass const pointers to packet bytes provided by
&gt; libpcap to user callbacks up to bitstring through OCaml [...]

AFAICT, this is what is done in my earlier link:

<a href="https://github.com/glondu/netacct-crans/blob/master/netacct-crans.ml">https://github.com/glondu/netacct-crans/blob/master/netacct-crans.ml</a>

rawstring in line 240 is a direct pointer to libpcap's buffer (in
particular, it is outside the OCaml heap). Of course, it being typed as
string is unsafe but it allows me to wrap it directly into a bitstring
(the "dark magic" that comes later) and then bitmatch-ed.

&gt; The system state is made of pretty much anything, and is also user
&gt; extensible via plugins.  Nothing prevents someone to stick in there
&gt; values that can hardly be marshalled, like callbacks, file descriptors,
&gt; lazy_t, and the like.  Of course it is nice to be able to store
&gt; callbacks or lazy values in the system state, so forbidding all that is
&gt; not nice.

There is a similar problem when marshalling a captured delimited
continuation. The continuation captures a part of stack that points to
various closures in system libraries, which contain lots of
unserializable stuff. In addition, reference cells (t ref) can't be
meaningfully serialized as they are copied in the process of the
serialization, which breaks their semantics. 

The library delimcc proposes a solution. Unlike your situation, I do
care to properly serialize `bad' value and properly restore. The
unmarshalled delimited continuation must work properly. I cannot
afford not to care what the unmarshalled value will look like.

The solution, which involves pre-processing a value before marshalling
and post-processing after unmarshalling, is described at
        <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/ML.html#persistent-delim2cc">http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/ML.html#persistent-delim2cc</a>
