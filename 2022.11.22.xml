      <cwn_what>
I'd like to announce the release of the first alpha version of the new
[~cohttp~](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp). If you are not familiar with it, ~cohttp~ is an OCaml library
for creating HTTP clients and servers. It has a portable HTTP parser, and implementations using various asynchronous
programming libraries.

This experimental release introduces a number of changes in cohttp's internals and in the libraries provided. In
particular:

- the new ~http~ library provides essential type definitions used in ~cohttp~ and also includes a new, extremely fast, http parser. The library is designed to have practically no dependencies and make it easy for other packages to easily interoperate with cohttp.
- ~cohttp-server-lwt-unix~ is a new lwt server backend that does not rely on conduit and uses direct lwt-io access. This should resolve most of the latency issues encountered with the old ~cohttp-lwt-unix~ library.
- ~cohttp-curl~ is a new ~libcurl~-based (via ~ocurl~) library, also providing an ~lwt~ and an ~async~ backend.
- ~cohttp-eio~ uses ~eio~ to leverage new features from multicore ocaml, it also include new very fast parser to fully benefit from eio at all levels.

All of this comes with a large number of fixed bugs, improved testing, new long-awaited features (like the http
cache for ~cohttp-lwt-unix~) and lots of internal refactoring and cleanup.

We would like to thank @rgrinberg @mefyl @anuragsoni @BikalGurung  and all the people that contributed with issues,
discussions, PRs and design ideas leading to this release.

Let's say I write something like this:

#+begin_src ocaml
match lexeme with
| "foo00" -> Foo00
| "foo01" -> Foo01
  ...
| "foo50" -> Foo50
| _ -> FooError
#+end_src
(My real keywords are not uniform like this.)
Does this compile to the obvious straight linear search, or is there any cleverness (like a constant hidden
hashtable perhaps)? Or should I have a hashtable myself?

The compiler explorer shows assembly output, but often other intermdiate representations are more readable (to me at
least). The example of @copy is

#+begin_src ocaml
let test x =
    match x with
    | "barfoofoo00" -> 1
    | "barfoofoo01" -> 2
    | "barfoofoo02" -> 3
    | "barfoofoo03" -> 4
    | "barfoofoo04" -> 5
    | "barfoofoo05" -> 6
    | "barfoofoo06" -> 7
    | "barfoofoo07" -> 8
    | "barfoofoo08" -> 9
    | "barfoofoo09" -> 10
    | "barfoofoo10" -> 11
    | "barfoofoo11" -> 12
    | "barfoofoo12" -> 13
    | "barfoofoo13" -> 14
    | "barfoofoo14" -> 15
    | "barfoofoo15" -> 16
    | "barfoofoo16" -> 17
    | "barfoofoo17" -> 18
    | "barfoofoo18" -> 19
    | "barfoofoo19" -> 20
    | _ -> -42
#+end_src

and the ~-dcmm~ output is as follows: (remember that integers are tagged in this representation, so for example
~39~, 2*19+1, is the encoding of ~19~ in the source.)

      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>gasche then said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Indeed! Thanks for the mention. Reposting below.

The strategy used by the OCaml compiler is not naive, but not hashing either. It will compile a switch on strings
(with a default case) into a tree of switches on characters (in fact words, see below), by reading characters at
specific positions in the string. It was implemented by Benoît Vaugon and Luc Maranget.

The position to read is selected as the /least/ discriminating position: we count the number of different values
(among the string patterns) for each position, and choose the (leftmost) position with the /smallest/ number of
possible values. The idea is that these positions must be tested anyway to eliminate the default case, so you may as
well check them first.

For example if you are matching on "aa" vs "ab" (or something else, the default case), and you know that your input
has size 2, you may generate either:

#+begin_example
    switch s[0]:
      case 'a':
        switch s[1]:
          case 'a': goto &lt;case "aa"&gt;
          case 'b': goto &lt;case "ab"&gt;
          default: goto &lt;default case&gt;
      default: goto &lt;default case&gt;
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
    switch s[1]:
      case 'a':
        switch s[0]:
          case 'a': goto &lt;case "aa"&gt;
          default: goto &lt;default case&gt;
      case 'b':
        switch s[0]:
          case 'a': goto &lt;case "ab"&gt;
          default: goto &lt;default case&gt;
      default: goto &lt;default case&gt;
#+end_example

and the /first/ approach is more interesting, it performs the same tests for each non-default value with shorter
code.

This is counter-intuitive: check the /least/ discriminating position first. It is more intuitive at first to check
the most discriminating position.

Regarding size: you start by switching on the size of the string, then you are left with groups of the same size,
where the same positions are valid.

Regarding characters: instead of looking up strings characters by characters, you can read whole machine word at
once, except at the very end of the string. In the case of ~{"one", "two", "three"}~, with the 0-ended
representation of C, a single 32bit read is enough to distinguish the three values, so you need a single position
switch (after switching on the size first).

I've recently added [contribution guidelines](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hacking.html#general-guidelines)
to dune's code base to help onboard potential contributors to dune. It's been suggested that it would be useful to
share them with the wider community so this is the purpose of this post.

Many guidelines are taken straight from Jane Street's internal rules which shouldn't be a surprise as the project
was started by a JST employee. The intent of sharing these is not to evangelize our coding style to other projects,
but perhaps inspire some of you to pick and choose the rules you like and maybe share some of your own.

@reisenberg wrote a
[summary](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-compiler-development-newsletter-issue-6-march-2022-to-september-2022/10777/7?u=yaron_minsky)
of our recent efforts on the compiler, and @sid asked a question about how this impacts Jane Street's publicly
released software:

#+begin_quote
How would the newer versions of the libraries that progressively use more and more of custom language be made
available to the OCaml community?
#+end_quote

This is a good question, given that it may well take years to upstream some of our compiler changes, and some of
them might not be accepted by upstream at all.

In some sense, we're in this world already. We've already made changes to Base, our standard library, to use the
local mode in order to better support stack allocation. And this has already made it in to our public release, as
you can see if you look for the ~[@local]~ annotations in the code below.

https://github.com/janestreet/base/blob/master/src/list.mli#L208

Our strategy here was to use the new feature in a way that doesn't break the syntax, so it could be smoothly
included in our public code. This works for modes because modes can be erased without changing the semantics of the
code.

This approach isn't always possible. Consider the ~include functor~ syntax that was mentioned in @reisenberg's post:

#+begin_src ocaml
module List = struct
  type 'a t =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * 'a t

  let mapi t ~f = ...

  include functor Make_map
end
#+end_src

This can't just be desugared away, as it happens, and so we simply block ourselves from using this feature within
publicly released code.

There's an obvious tension here, since blocking ourselves from using new features makes it more painful to open
source things. Part of our intent here is to prioritize the upstreaming of things that cause these problems.
~include functor~ is an example of a feature that's pretty small, and we think is generally quite useful, so we
intend to propose it upstream soon.

I suspect unboxed types will be more like ~include functor~ than like modes, in that it's going to be hard to use it
in a way that's compatible with the public release. We haven't yet really worked through what the tradeoffs will be
there.

In any case, our public release code is important to us, and we're going to continue to release new versions. We
value the fact that it's helpful to the community, but it's also more directly valuable to us. In particular, it
makes it easier for us to reuse work done by other people, since people spend the time and effort to build libraries
that interoperate well with our code (notably, with Async). And also, our public release helps people take into
account our usage patterns when working on the compiler or other important community tools like Merlin or
OCamlformat.

3.5.0](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-5-0/10660).
Thanks again to all the contributors including bug reporters.

*** dune executable

This lists features of the “dune” executable itself. Upgrading dune will bring in these changes. We consider these
changes safe, but it is difficult to define what a breaking change is for a command-line tool (for example, some
error messages change). It is important to note that just upgrading the dune executable is not supposed to change
how dune interprets existing projects. If just upgrading dune breaks compilation, it is a bug in dune, please report
it!

**** Added

- Introduce a ~$ dune ocaml top-module~ subcommand to load modules directly without sealing them behind the signature. (#5940, @rgrinberg)
- Revive ~$ dune external-lib-deps~ under ~$ dune describe external-lib-deps~. (#6045, @moyodiallo)
- Extend the promotion CLI to a ~dune promotion~ group: ~dune promote~ is moved to ~dune promotion apply~ (the former still works) and the new ~dune promotion diff~ command can be used to just display the promotion without applying it. (#6160, fixes #5368, @emillon)
- Build progress status now shows number of failed jobs (#6242, @Alizter)
- Allow promoting into source directories specified by ~subdir~ (#6404, fixes #3502, @rgrinberg)
- Support ~CLICOLOR~ and ~CLICOLOR_FORCE~ to enable/disable/force ANSI colors. (#6340, fixes #6323, @MisterDA).
- Create a fake socket file ~_build/.rpc/dune~ on windows to allow rpc clients to connect using the build directory. (#6329, @rgrinberg)

**** Fixed

- Forbid multiple instances of dune running concurrently in the same workspace. (#6360, fixes #236, @rgrinberg)
- Make dune describe workspace return the correct root path (#6380, fixes #6379, @esope)
- Fix running inline tests in bytecode mode (#5622, fixes #5515, @dariusf)

*** (lang dune 3.6)

This lists changes if you opt into the new ~(lang dune 3.6)~ version in your dune-project file. For this too, these
are changes that we consider safe, but they can require changes to your dune files. For example, sandboxing is
enabled in more places, which means that you might have to be more precise in expressing your dependencies. Please
reach out on the issue tracker if you have trouble fixing your dune file or if something does not seem to be
possible anymore.

**** Added

- Add ~(glob_files &lt;glob&gt;)~ and ~(glob_files_rec &lt;glob&gt;)~ terms to the ~files~ field of the ~install~ stanza (#6250, closes #6018, @gridbugs)
- Allow ~Byte_complete~ binaries to be installable (#4837, @AltGr, @rgrinberg)
- Allow ~:standard~ in the ~(modules)~ field of the ~coq.pp~ stanza (#6229, fixes #2414, @Alizter)

**** Fixed

- Allow absolute build directories to find public executables. For example, those specified with ~(deps %{bin:...})~ (#6326, @anmonteiro)
- [ctypes] do not mangle user written names in the ctypes stanza (#6374, fixes #5561, @rgrinberg)
- Forbid private libraries with ~(package ..)~ set from depending on private libraries that don't belong to a package (#6385, fixes #6153, @rgrinberg)
- [ctypes] always re-run ~pkg-config~ because we aren't tracking its external dependencies (#6052, @rgrinberg)
- [ctypes] remove dependency on configurator in the generated rules (#6052, @rgrinberg)
- Fix passing of flags to dune coq top (#6369, fixes #6366, @Alizter)
- Prevent crash if absolute paths are used in the install stanza and in  recursive globs. These cases now result in a user error. (#6331, @gridbugs)

I wrote about monads recently here: https://cryptologie.net/article/578/simple-introduction-to-monads-in-ocaml/

and state monads here: https://cryptologie.net/article/581/state-monads-in-ocaml/

thought this might be useful to someone trying to learn these as well

      <cwn_who>hyphenrf then said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I see you do toplevel-~open~ in your code, which is generally only good for namespaced modules not identifiers.
A more idiomatic way to access definitions is to refer to them directly by their fully-qualified names, or do a
local-~open~.
#+begin_src ocaml
open Mod

let f x = a ...
let g x = b ...
let h x = c ...
#+end_src
becomes
#+begin_src ocaml
let f x = Mod.a ...
let g x =
  let open Mod in
  b ...
let h x = Mod.(c ...)
#+end_src
so for example:
#+begin_src ocaml
let res = Monad.(
  let* a = Some 5 in
  let* b = Some 6 in
  return (a + b)
)
#+end_src

      <cwn_title>Confero 0.1.1</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-confero-0-1-1/10823/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>"Petter A. Urkedal announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
[Confero](https://github.com/paurkedal/confero) implements the [Unicode Collation Algorithm
(UCA)](https://unicode.org/reports/tr10/), currently built for Unicode 15.0.0.  It also provides the Default Unicode
Collation Element Table (DUCET), which implements a language-agnostic collation order.

For most use-cases, it should suffice to link with ~confero~ and ~confero.ducet~ and use the single entry point
~Confero.collate~.  For a drop-in replacement for ~String.compare~, pass ~~total:true~, otherwise it will disagree
with ~(=)~ due to normalization.  If you don't link with ~confero.ducet~, the default collation will be based on
Unicode codepoints. The API allows you to take more control of which collation mapping is used, and to evaluate
separate stages of the UCA, if needed.

I haven't looked into localizing collation, but it should be possible to create a custom mapping which calls the
DUCET mapping as a fall-back.  Note, however, that the collation elements are not stable across Unicode versions.
[CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/) should of interest to those who want to look into this.

The API documentation is not online yet, but I'll post a link when it gets indexed on ocaml.org.

I am very pleased to announce the experimental distribution of Bob available on this
[website](https://bob.osau.re/).

Bob is an OCaml-based file-sharing application. For the Robur team, this is our first application using the
[Esperanto project](https://github.com/dinosaure/esperanto) (announced some time ago) allowing us to distribute a
single binary that works on almost all platforms (including Windows).

This software also uses, as far as its relay is concerned, a unikernel developed with [MirageOS](https://mirage.io)
and deployed by yours truly.

Finally, the distribution of the binary or the relay is offered by the reproducible infrastructure developed by the
Robur team and available here: https://builds.robur.io/

The website (also [a unikernel](https://github.com/roburio/unipi)) contains all the information about Bob, its use,
its configuration, etc. A series of Questions/Answers is also available there.

We would like to say that the project is *experimental*. Even though we are ready to deliver the software in due
form, we are aware of some bugs and we will continue to improve the software. However, the practical case, its use
and user feedback are needed at this stage - and that is why we are announcing its availability.

A series of articles to understand the whole development and deployment process is available:
- [Esperanto, when OCaml meets Cosmopolitan](https://blog.osau.re/articles/esperanto.html)
- [Spoke, an implementation of SPAKE2+EE in OCaml](https://blog.osau.re/articles/spoke.html)
- [The Bob's state machine with GADTs](https://blog.osau.re/articles/gadt_and_state_machine.html)
- [The Robur's reproducible infrastructure](https://blog.osau.re/articles/reproducible.html)
- [Albatross, to deploy your unikernel](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Albatross)

If you are interested in the project and want to help us maintain all that it entails or if you consider what we do
to be super cool, you can donate [here](https://robur.coop/Donate).
