*v0.17 release of Jane Street packages*

Dear OCaml developers,

We are pleased to announce the v0.17 release of Jane Street packages!

This release comes with 15 new packages and a multitude of new features and fixes.

*** Switch to OCaml 5.1

We are switching Base and all our packages (except ~sexplib0~) to OCaml 5.1 and above. We are also switching ~sexplib0~ to 4.14 to take advantage of the Tail Recursion Modulo Cons optimization in the compiler.

*** Core on OCaml 5.2

Due to some changes to ~Stdlib.Gc~ in OCaml 5.2, ~core.v0.17.0~ fails to compile with that language version. We will release a fix that allows using Core with OCaml 5.2 soon.

*** Torch and VCaml

Due to some issues with their builds, ~torch.v0.17.0~ and ~vcaml.v0.17.0~ were omitted from the main v0.17 release. We will soon submit those packages to opam.

*** Changes

Browse our [[https://github.com/janestreet][GitHub repositories]] and look at the respective ~CHANGES.md~ files for changes since the v0.16 release. For examples, see changelogs for [[https://github.com/janestreet/base/blob/master/CHANGES.md][Base]], [[https://github.com/janestreet/async_kernel/blob/master/CHANGES.md][Async_kernel]], and [[https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai/blob/master/CHANGES.md][Bonsai]].

*** New packages

[[https://github.com/janestreet/async_log][async_log]] – a logging library for Async code, moved from ~async_unix~

[[https://github.com/janestreet/capitalization][capitalization]] – a library for case conventions and renaming identifiers

[[https://github.com/janestreet/codicons][codicons]] – icons from VS Code for use with Bonsai

[[https://github.com/janestreet/gel][gel]] – a library to mark non-record fields global for use with our compiler extensions

[[https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml_event_driven_sim][hardcaml_event_driven_sim]] – a simulator library for Hardcaml

* jsonschema2atd, Generate an ATD file from a JSON Schema / OpenAPI document

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-jsonschema2atd-generate-an-atd-file-from-a-json-schema-openapi-document/14718/1

** Louis Roché announced


Ahrefs has released jsonschema2atd, a cli tool to convert an OpenAPI or Json Schema specification into an atd file.

Quite a lot of api out there are now publishing some kind of spec for their expected input our output. It's often done through a a JSON Schema or OpenAPI document. The goal of this tool is to save time for large api by doing a mechanical translation to an atd file instead of writing all the types by hand.

Unfortunately the world is kind of a mess. Most of the specs we have seen are not following a specific version of openapi/jsonschema but contain a bit of everything. jsonschema2atd does its best to do the right thing, but there are probably cases that aren't covered.

The generated code might also not be optimal. It often deserves some hand cleanup and a bit of renaming. Hopefully it still gives a good head start.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/ixzzd][Egor Chemokhonenko]] for this work.

The code is available at https://github.com/ahrefs/jsonschema2atd

And there is a package that is published on opam https://ocaml.org/p/jsonschema2atd/latest
      



* opam-repository policy change: checksums (no md5) and no extra-files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-opam-repository-policy-change-checksums-no-md5-and-no-extra-files/14720/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


Dear everyone,

the opam-repository policy just changed to *not accept md5-only checksums*, and also to *avoid extra-files* in packages (use extra-source instead).

*** NOTE:
If you encounter issues during ~opam update~, please make sure to have ~opam 2.1.6~ installed, and ~gpatch~ (especially on BSD systems and macOS). This may break silently, if you encounter issues, please ~rm -rf ~/.opam/repo/default && opam update default~ See further notes in https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/25961

*** What has been achieved?
- A new lint check that errors on md5-only checksum specification has been put into place https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci/pull/304
- A new lint check that errors if ~extra-files~ is present https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci/pull/313
- The existing ~extra-files~, bundled in the opam-repository, have been moved to opam-source-archives (https://github.com/ocaml/opam-source-archives/pull/28)
- The opam files in the opam-repository were changed to use extra-source with the opam-source-archives repository https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/commit/76eb35c8a78a891c7e5e27b5c32316d7add1f52d
- All existing (and available) packages using only md5 have been upgraded to use sha256 as well (https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/commit/ea87c49e51ff29a459422419e1688938fd77a46f)
- See the PR for the full changes https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25960
- See discussion at https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/25876

These changes were automated using ~opam admin migrate-extrafiles~ and ~opam admin add-hashes~ (using the branch https://github.com/hannesm/opam/tree/migrate-extra-files). There is a utility to check that existing files and md5 checksums are still present in the new opam-repository https://github.com/hannesm/opam-check-checksum.

*** Impact on users and developers
- A lot of packages will want to be recompiled on ~opam upgrade~ (since checksum changed, extra-files/extra-source was modified) -- sorry for the extensive use of CPU time
- If you need to include a patch or an extra file for your opam package, you will need to host it elsewhere. You can host it using a gist (https://gist.github.com), or on your server. All the ~extra-source~ will be cached by ~opam.ocaml.org~.

*** The reasoning for this change
Apart from making the mental model of "how does opam-repository work" easier (since there's no more any ~files~ subdirectory which includes files that are added during the build), it also makes the approach to cryptographically sign the repository much smoother (since we can now rely on non-weak hash algorithms and don't need to compute more hashes, and not need to add further hashes to the repository).

We needed to get both (weak hashes AND removing extra-files) through at some point, it has been done today.

** borisd announced


I am pleased to announce the alpha release of [[https://github.com/dboris/camlkit][Camlkit]]. 
Camlkit provides OCaml bindings to a collection of Cocoa frameworks on macOS, iOS, and GNUstep. Currently available are Foundation, AppKit, UIKit, WebKit, CoreImage, Photos, and Vision.

The package ~camlkit~ for macOS/GNUstep development is available from OPAM. The key libraries to add to your dune file are ~camlkit-base.foundation~ and ~camlkit-gui.appkit~.

iOS development requires a [[https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-ios][cross-toolchain]]. The package is named ~camlkit-ios~. UIKit is in the library ~camlkit-gui.uikit~.

Other useful resources:
- [[https://github.com/dboris/camlkit-starter-nostoryboard][a starter project template for iOS]]
- [[https://github.com/dboris/camlkit-examples/][a few example porgrams]]

More information is available on the [[https://github.com/dboris/camlkit][project's github page]]. Feedback and contributions are welcome. I hope we can make OCaml viable for GUI development and on mobile. Happy hacking!
      



* position for MoonBit advocate

** Hongbo Zhang announced


MoonBit is ML language inspired by Rust, Go and OCaml, it was announced with a [[https://www.moonbitlang.com/blog/first-announce][Wasm backend]], and recently we added a [[https://www.moonbitlang.com/blog/js-support][JavaScript backend]], we plan to ship a native backend this year.

It is similar to OCaml, the main difference is that we have traits, zero-cost generics and modern tooling support. You are welcome to DM for more details.

* Yojson 2.2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-yojson-2-2-0/14737/1

** Marek Kubica announced


Hello fellow Camel-wranglers,

It's my pleasure to announce the release of Yojson 2.2.0 which you can find in your neighborhood [[https://ocaml.org/p/yojson/2.2.0][opam-repository]].

The most important highlights include:

- [[https://json5.org/][JSON5]] support. Getting annoyed by dangling commas being a problem or the inability to use comments? JSON5 is basically JSON but with the object syntax of ECMAScript 5.1 which allows some additional features like unquoted keys, dangling commas or well, comments. This has been in the works for years but finally made it to the finish-line. The new JSON5 parser requires ~sedlex~ and at least OCaml 4.08, thus it is part of the [[https://ocaml.org/p/yojson-five/2.2.0][yojson-five]] package. Its usage mimics the ~Yojson~ package; there exist both ~Basic~ and ~Safe~ variants and the AST matches the JSON variants.
- No CPPO dependency anymore. Given the large amount of reverse-dependencies on Yojson, each dependency of Yojson is going to be a dependency of a lot of packages, thus keeping the dependency cone small makes everything (slightly) faster. As such, instead of using CPPO as a compile-time dependency we now use [[https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/mucppo][µCPPO]] as a light-weight alternative. µCPPO is meant for embedding as part of the build process and supports a tiny subset of what CPPO supports but without an extra package.

Happy de- and encoding!

** "Alistair O'Brien announced


I'm excited to announce the release of [[https://github.com/johnyob/grace/releases/tag/0.2.0][grace 0.2.0]], an OCaml library for building, reporting and rendering beautiful compiler diagnostics :camel: :paintbrush:. Now available on [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25956][opam-repository]].

The three main features of this release include:
- :books: *UTF8 support*: Source files can now contain Unicode characters, including emojis ⚡️ 🌈 🚀, with proper rendering of ASCII art for errors.

- :1234: *Error Codes*: Diagnostics can now include short, searchable error codes. Allowing compilers to integrate a [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html][Rust-like error code index]].

- 🤏 *Compact ANSI Errors*: ~Grace_ansi_renderer~ now supports a ~pp_compact_diagnostic~ for concise error messages, displaying only the file location and the error message.

* First release of Slipshow on opam!
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 10

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-slipshow-on-opam/14743/1

** Paul-Elliot announced


It is my pleasure to announce the first [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/25948#issuecomment-2146906766][release]] of [[https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow][slipshow]] on ~opam~.

Slipshow is a presentation tool to create presentation that are not based on slides, but on more continuous transitions, similar to scrolling.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panglesd/slipshow/master/slip_scroll.gif

You can find more information and examples on the [[https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow][project repo]] and on the [[https://slipshow.readthedocs.io][documentation]].

How is that related to the OCaml community? While the "runtime"/"engine" is still written in javascript (I did not know OCaml back then, but there is a [[https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/issues/32][plan]] to rewrite it), the compiler is written in OCaml! And I am really grateful for the many authors of open source libraries, of very high quality, that I depend on and could do nothing without them :) **Thanks a lot** to all OCaml library and tool authors!

#+begin_example
$ opam update
$ opam install slipshow
# create and open ~source.md~ in your editor
$ slipshow --serve source.md
#+end_example

Hope it can be useful :D
