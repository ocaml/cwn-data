Daniel Bünzli announced

  It's my pleasure to announce the release `0.0.2' of [`Brr'], a toolkit
  for programming browsers in OCaml with the [`js_of_ocaml'] compiler.

  Once it has made it to the repo, install with `opam install brr' and
  consult the [API docs and manuals] (or via `odig doc brr').

  This release fixes binding bugs, adds a few new bindings and tweaks
  some existing signatures. Thanks to all of those who provided bug
  reports, suggestions and code.

  The [release notes] have all the details.

Become an Outreachy Mentor: support the growth and diversity of the OCaml community

Thibaut Mattio announced

  I've submitted two projects for the winter session:

  • Integrate a package health check in ocaml.org

  To essentially integrate a version of check.ocamllabs.io that can be
  used by opam-repository maintainers and opam users into the next
  version of ocaml.org (<https://v3.ocaml.org>).

  • Support `.eml' files in OCaml's VSCode extension

  To add support for Dream's [`.eml' files] syntax in the extension, and
  eventually have error reporting for these files from OCaml LSP Server.

  I'm more than interested in having co-mentors for these two projects,
  so if you wanted to mentor Outreachy interns but didn't have any
  project ideas, don't hesitate to reach out :slight_smile:

  Another way to help that does not involve mentoring is to find good
  first issues that will help onboard and select candidates for the
  projects. Any help on this effort to identify, create and document
  good first issues for the different projects is more than welcome!

OCaml 4.13.0 (and 4.12.1)
═════════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-13-0-and-4-12-1/8529/1>


octachron announced
───────────────────

  The OCaml team ha the pleasure of celebrating the 175th anniversary of
  the discovery of Neptune by announcing the joint releases of OCaml
  version 4.13.0 and 4.12.1 .

  Some of the highlights in the 4.13.0 release are:

  • Safe points: a multicore prerequisite that ensures that
    ocamlopt-generated code can always be interrupted.
  • The best-fit GC allocation policy is now the default policy (and
    many other GC improvements).
  • Named existential type variables in pattern matching: `Showable
    (type a) (x, show : a * (a -> string))'.

  • Improved error messages for functor application and functor types.
  • Let-punning for monadic let: `let* x = x in' can be shortened to
    `let* x in'.
  • Module type substitutions: `SIG with module type T = F(X).S'.

  • Many other quality of life improvements
  • Many bug fixes

  The 4.12.1 release is a collection of safe bug fixes, cherry-picked
  from the 4.13.0 development cycle. If you were using OCaml 4.12.0 and
  cannot yet upgrade to 4.13.0, this release is for you.

  The full list of changes can be found in the changelogs
  below. (*Editor note*: as it’s quite long, it is not included
  here. Please follow the link to the original article to read it.)

  Those releases are available as OPAM switches, and as a source
  download here:

  • <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.13.0.tar.gz>
  • <https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.13/>

  and there:

  • <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.12.1.tar.gz>
  • <https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.12/>
