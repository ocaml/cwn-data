Hello folks! :wave: 

*** Call for Feedback

We'd like to welcome everyone to try and play with the [Dune Developer Preview](https://dune.ci.dev)! :tada: 

This experimental nightly release of dune includes a lot of improvements, including the much expected package management features, and it can be installed from that website or by using the new installation script:

#+begin_example
$ curl https://dune.ci.dev/install | bash
#+end_example

In a few seconds you should be ready to OCaml by calling ~dune~ ‚Äì you can watch a demo of this here: [X](https://x.com/leostera/status/1838969568795979922), [Mastodon](https://mas.to/deck/@leostera/113198996085937679).

Please try it out and let us know what you think :pray: 

:calendar: You can book a feedback call with us [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ3HaJbskiCLHqLS6Oi1S3-rWYwv0hb_Iz8O9VlspuDdK5qbXYUZDpRRlWfEY1GP8KFy6XY8MFb9)

:memo:  You can submit feedback using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/d/e/1FAIpQLSda-mOTHIdATTt_e9dFmNgUCy-fD55Qzr3bGGsxpfY_Ecfyxw/viewform?usp=send_form)

:bug:  You can submit issues to Github on [ocaml/dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/new/choose)

*** Changes since last update

The Dune shared cache has been enabled by default. We're starting off by caching all downloads and dependencies.

We have improved support for dev tools. We're working to streamline this but in the latest binary you can:

- Configure your LSP (in Neovim, Vim, Emacs, etc) to call ~dune tools exec ocamllsp~ to get LSP support for your projects out of the box ‚Äì this may take a little bit the first time it builds the LSP for a compiler version, but its pretty much instant afterwards.
- Call ~dune fmt~ to get your project formatted ‚Äì remember to add an ~.ocamlformat~ file if you don't have one yet. An empty one is enough.
- Call ~dune ocaml doc~ to get documentation built 

*** What's next?

We're looking forward to streamlining the DX, working on better dependency locks, and looking into supporting Windows.

In particular, we're considering work on a few things:

- ~dune create &lt;repo&gt;~ ‚Äì to let the community create templates that can be easily used from within dune
- ~dune pkg fetch~ ‚Äì to prefetch packages and prepare a repository for working in offline mode
- ~dune build @deps~ - to build all dependencies, useful for staged builds in Dockerfiles
- ~dune pkg add &lt;name&gt;~ - to make adding packages straightforward
- a short-hand syntax for pins on github
- and more!

If you've got any ideas, we'd love to hear them, so please open a feature request on Github :pray: 

*** Other updates

**** FunOCaml Presentation
At *FunOCaml* we had a last-minute opportunity to present the work being done on Dune and we used it to introduce the Developer Preview to the community, and even tested Package Management live with suggestions from the audience (thanks @anmonteiro and Paul-Elliot for participating!) ‚Äì you can [watch it on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2252408016?t=08h12m00s).

**** New design
We're working with @Claire_Vandenberghe on redesigning the Developer Preview website so that it'd feel like a seamless extension of OCaml.org ‚Äì in this current iteration we've made it easier to get started and we're putting the FAQ front and center.

We'll be iterating on this design in the coming weeks until it fits perfectly within the OCaml.org design system :art: 

You can check the new website here: https://dune.ci.dev 

**** Upcoming Blog posts
In the near future we'll be publishing blog posts about the Developer Preview and Package Management, which we're working on with @professor.rose :clap:

      <cwn_who>Daniel B√ºnzli announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
There's a new release of [Uuidm](https://erratique.ch/software/uuidm), a library to handle universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

This very old module has been slightly renovated implying a few deprecations, a  [quick start](https://erratique.ch/software/uuidm/doc/#quick) has been added to the docs and foremost new constructors and generators were added to support the latest [RFC 9562](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562) V7 time and random based UUID definitions; thanks to ~xen-api~ folks for getting the ball rolling on this. See the [release notes](https://github.com/dbuenzli/uuidm/blob/master/CHANGES.md#v099-2024-09-26-zagreb) for the details. 

- Docs: [online](https://erratique.ch/software/uuidm/doc/) or ~odig doc uuidm~
- Install: ~opam install uuidm~ ([PR](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/26621))

A big thanks to my [donors](https://github.com/sponsors/dbuenzli).

      <cwn_who>Louis Roch√© announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Released 0.0.2 on opam. It feels like the project is in a good shape now.

Changes:
- support for nativeint, bytes, ref, unit
- add ~variant_as_array for compatibility with ppx_deriving_yojson
- support variant payloads
- support polymorphic variants inheritance
- fix encoding of tuples
- change encoding of variants from enum to anyOf

I'm considering making ~variant_as_array~ the default in 0.0.3 as it would be more consistent with the ocaml ecosystem.

      <cwn_who>sanette announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I'm happy to announce a brand new version of [Bogue](https://github.com/sanette/bogue), version 20240928, now availble on ~opam~.

Changes are mostly under the hood. We have nice improvements by @edwin : automatic monitor vsync is now enabled by default, for smoother animations, and most importantly *we finally align with the latest version of ~tsdl~*. It will simplify maintenance, but it also implies that *too old versions of SDL will not work anymore*. On the other hand we were kind of obliged to move forward, because ~tsdl.0.9.8~ won't install on ~ocaml 5.2~.

- if you're on Ubuntu 20.04, installing Bogue with ~opam install bogue~ will by default pull ~tsdl.1.1.0~ in, which requires SDL >= 2.0.18, not shipped by the OS. A workaround is to explicitly require ~opam install tsdl.1.0.0~ (or manually installing a newer SDL)
- if your OS ships SDL &lt; 2.0.10 you have no other choice than manually installing a newer [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.7) (which is not that complicated)

Happy bogue-ing!

      <cwn_title>New release of Merlin</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-merlin/15358/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>vds announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am very pleased to announce a new release of Merlin for OCaml 5.2, 5.1 and 4.14. This release brings a handful of fixes but also a handful of of new commands: 

- ~signature_help~ and ~inlay_hint~ have been upstreamed from ~ocaml-lsp-server~
- ~expand_node~ a command to get the ppxed-source when called on relevant annotations
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ~search-by-type~ a [sherlodoc](https://doc.sherlocode.com/)-inspired syntax to search for values in the environment, that superseeds ~polarity-search~.

Only ~search-by-type~ has an Emacs binding right now (and one for vim on is [in the works](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/pull/1846)), we hope to have some time to work on more client implementations in the near future.

      <cwn_what>
Dear OCaml developers,

we're pleased to finally release a full stack of packages that do not rely on Cstruct.t/Bigarray, but use string / bytes instead. This brings us a massive performance boost (e.g. a factor of 3 in tls), and brings a easier to comprehend API. It also makes performance tooling work much more smoothly with our released packages. We announced this upcoming change earlier this year https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mirage-crypto-0-11-3-with-more-speed-for-elliptic-curves-and-the-future-roadmap-of-mirage-crypto

For further details, please see the specific release pages:
- [mirage-crypto 1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (also [1.0.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1), and [1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/releases/tag/v1.1.0)) - cryptographic operations in OCaml (symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers (RSA, DSA, DH), fortuna (a cryptographic secure pseudo random number generator), elliptic curves (from [fiat-crypto](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/)) -- the hash algorithms have been removed - use [digestif](https://github.com/mirage/digestif) instead
- [tls 1.0.0](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (also [1.0.1](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/releases/tag/v1.0.1), [1.0.2](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/releases/tag/v1.0.2), and [1.0.3](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/releases/tag/v1.0.0)) - a Transport layer security implementation (HTTPS) in OCaml, supporting TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3
- [x509 1.0.0](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-x509/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (also [1.0.1](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-x509/releases/tag/v1.0.1), [1.0.2](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-x509/releases/tag/v1.0.2), [1.0.3](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-x509/releases/tag/v1.0.3), and [1.0.4](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-x509/releases/tag/v1.0.4)) - X509 certificates (signing requests, certificate revocation lists, PKCS12)
- [asn1-combinators 0.3.0](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-asn1-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (also [0.3.1](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-asn1-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.1) and [0.3.2](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-asn1-combinators/releases/tag/v0.3.2)) - ASN.1 parser combinators
- [let's encrypt 1.0.0](https://github.com/robur-coop/ocaml-letsencrypt/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - a client for https://letsencrypt.org - automated TLS certificate issuance
- [awa 0.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/awa-ssh/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - a SSH client and server implementation
- [kdf 1.0.0](https://github.com/robur-coop/kdf/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - supporting different key derivation functions: hkdf (used in TLS), PBKDF2, SCRYPT
- [paf 0.7.0](https://github.com/dinosaure/paf-le-chien/releases/tag/0.7.0) - protocol-agnostic client (http / http2)
- [git 3.17.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/releases/tag/3.17.0) - an implementation of the version control system git https://git-scm.com
- [dns 9.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/releases/tag/v9.0.0) (also [9.0.1](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/releases/tag/v9.0.1)) - an implementation of the domain name system

As you can envision, there was a lot of coordination and releasing involved in preparing these API-breaking changes. The list above likely misses various packages that have been released to support the new mirage-crypto and tls API.

There have already been various issues reported and fixed in the subsequent minor releases. We encourage you to upgrade your software stack to the new release series, and report issues while you encounter them (being it API questions, or correctness issues). Earlier releases are not maintained anymore (due to lack of interest and lack of time), thus if you encounter issues in earlier releases, please first update to the most recent releases (although this may need some effort -- a PR that uses the packages heavily is https://github.com/robur-coop/miragevpn/pull/279). If you're stuck or lack time to port your code to the new API, we at robur offer commercial support in upgrading your codebase. Reach out to us via email: team@robur.coop.

This work has been conducted by the [robur collective](https://robur.coop). Parts of this work was sponsored by Tarides.
