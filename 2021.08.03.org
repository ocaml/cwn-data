* Do You Need ~ppxlib~ and ~ocaml-migrate-parsetree~ in the Same Project?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/do-you-need-ppxlib-and-ocaml-migrate-parsetree-in-the-same-project/8207/1

** Sonja Heinze announced


Hello PPX users (directly or transitively),

I'd like to discuss here in this thread if there's still a demand to use ~ppxlib~ and
~ocaml-migrate-parsetree.1.x~ (~OMP1~) in the same project. Yesterday, I posted here on
discuss about the state of the PPX ecosystem and [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/an-update-on-the-state-of-the-ppx-ecosystem-and-ppxlib-s-transition/8200#part-three-porting-ppxs-to-put-an-end-to-the-split-world-situation-5][pointed out that the public PPX ecosystem
has almost completely shifted to
~ppxlib~]].
Still, we'd like to know your perspective on this question. Have you lately run into a
problem due to the incompatibility between ~ppxlib~ and ~OMP1~? Did you formerly have such
problems but lately all the PPXs you use have already been ported to ~ppxlib~? These
questions are directed to any OCaml user, so please comment any details on this post and
point out which PPXs were involved. Thanks in advance!

The rest of this post gives some more context about why we're asking these questions now in
case folks are interested, but it's not needed for the discussion we'd like to have about the
questions stated above.

*** Some Context

The next ~ppxlib~ release ~0.23.0~ will contain the integration of ~Astlib~ and therefore
will drop its dependency on ~ocaml-migrate-parsetree~ (~OMP~). Now we need to decide if to
mark ~OMP1~ as a conflict for ~ppxlib~ in opam or not.

To give more background, the PPX ecosystem is [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/an-update-on-the-state-of-the-ppx-ecosystem-and-ppxlib-s-transition/8200/1][transitioning to be more
up-to-date]].
The three contextually relevant states of this transition are:
1. ~ppxlib~ depends on ~OMP < 2.0.0~. The PPX driver is in ~OMP~.
2. ~ppxlib~ depends on ~OMP >= 2.0.0~. The PPX driver is in ~ppxlib~.
3. ~ppxlib~ doesn't depend on ~OMP~ anymore. It uses its internal / the compiler library ~Astlib~. The PPX driver is in ~ppxlib~.

During State 1, you can use ~ppxlib~ PPXs and ~OMP1~ PPXs in the same project. During State
2, ~ppxlib~ opam conflicts with ~OMP1~. During State 3, if we leave everything as-is, you can
install both ~ppxlib~ and ~OMP1~ for the same project. But also during State 3, you're unable
to use ~ppxlib~ PPXs and ~OMP1~ PPXs in the same library or executable because if your build
system uses a PPX driver, the PPX driver needs to be unique. Now we need to decide whether to
leave the conflict between ~ppxlib~ of State 3 and ~OMP1~ at the level of the build system or
to lift it up to the package manager by making ~OMP1~ an opam conflict for ~ppxlib~. Both
options have their pros and cons, which have already been somewhat discussed on [[https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib/pull/255][the
corresponding PR]]. To sum them up:

**** Option 1: not making ~OMP1~ a conflict for ~ppxlib~

*Advantage*: You would be able to use ~ppxlib~ PPXs and ~OMP1~ PPXs in the same project,
but they still can't be used together inside the same library or executable.

*Disadvantage*: If you use several PPXs inside the same library or executable, there's no
direct guarantee that you and your users install compatible versions of the PPXs for the
build system. To guarantee that, you'd have to add certain dependency constraints to your
opam file. We would make sure the way to define those dependency constraints would be well
documented and could be found easily.

**** Option 2: making ~OMP1~ a conflict for ~ppxlib~

*Advantage*: Without adding any dependency constraints yourself, opam will ensure that you
and your users don't install both ~ppxlib~ and ~OMP1~, only to get an error at build time.

*Disadvantage*: You couldn't use ~ppxlib~ PPXs and ~OMP1~ PPXs in the same project, not
even separating them at the level of libraries/executables. You also couldn't use an
exectubale based on ~ppxlib~ together with a ~OMP1~ PPX in the same project. In short: the
situation would stay the same as it is currently during State 2.

To make the best decision, we need to know if the possibility to use ~ppxlib~ and ~OMP1~
inside the same project, separated by libraries/executables, is still in demand.
      

** Lucas Pluvinage replied


In a web project I wanted to use ~graphql-ppx~
(https://github.com/reasonml-community/graphql-ppx) but the last version released on opam
(v1.0.1) was using ~OMP~ whereas other parts of the project were using ppxlib.

However the compatibility is not a hard requirement for me because more recent versions of
that package (v1.2.2) are actually compatible with ppxlib. The solution for me was to vendor
the project and wait for an upcoming opam release, which has been discussed in a Github
issue.
      

** Sonja Heinze then said


By the way, the ~graphql_ppx~ version containing the ~ppxlib~ port is now also
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/graphql_ppx/][released on
opam]], so hopefully no one will have to vendor
it again for PPX incompatibility reasons. :)

*** What is Outreachy?

[[https://www.outreachy.org/][Outreachy]] is an initiative that provides financial support for
remote internships, in open-source communities, to under-represented groups. It provides
interns with the opportunity for their first experience in open-source development.

Outreachy promotes diversity and inclusion in the open-source community. It acts as a central
point for organising internships for groups of people who historically have faced systemic
bias in the programming world.

*** Outreachy and OCaml

Following the successful effort from the OCaml Software Foundation last year, this year OCaml
Labs and Tarides joined forces to continue our efforts to bring more new developers into the
OCaml community from diverse backgrounds. We selected three Outreachy interns to work with us
on different OCaml projects.

**** Current OCaml Interns

We merged over 75 PRs and resolved over 70 issues during the initial contribution period this
year on the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org][ocaml/ocaml.org]] repository! This was the
most activity the repository had seen since 2014. There were so many candidate interns, keen
to join the OCaml community and start developing.

This year, we have three interns working with us: Diksha Gupta, Odinaka Joy and Shreya Kumari
Gupta.
- *Diksha Gupta* is working on automating and expanding ocaml.org's new and experimental peertube instance for hosting OCaml-related video content.
- *Odinaka Joy* is prototyping and building an online package search web application and service.
- *Shreya Kumari Gupta* is helping to build and design a new ocaml.org website.

They've all made amazing progress and we can't wait to share more about these projects
towards the end of their internships!

*** Continuing to grow Outreachy and OCaml

Outreachy programs run every six months, and so even though the current round is still
ongoing, we need to plan how to participate in the forthcoming Winter 2021 round.

One of the big bottlenecks in growing the program is having a sufficient supply of projects
and mentors from the OCaml community who are willing to work with the enthusiastic Outreachy
interns to get them started on contributing to our ecosystem. That's the goal of this post --
to convince you to sign up!

*** Benefits of being a mentor

Outreachy is an amazing and rewarding experience that:

- Increases diversity in the OCaml community.
- Attracts more contributers to OCaml or to open-source projects in general.
- Improves your project with an additional developer.
- Has an enriching experience: work together with people from many different backgrounds and ways of thinking.
- Promotes OCaml: When people learn about Outreachy, they often go through the list of communities that are or were signed up in the past. That's a good way for those from under-represented groups to learn about OCaml. It also puts the OCaml community in a good light. We know that this is how some people who now form part of the OCaml community first learned about OCaml and got excited about it.

*** Expectations of being a mentor

**** * Time commitment

During the three month internship, mentors need to commit to working with the Outreachy
intern for approximately 5 hours per week. During the one month contribution period that
takes place before the internship starts, mentors must help prospective applicants with
issues and PRs which can take anywhere between 1 to 15 hours per week depending on how many
interested applicants there are.

**** * Your open-source repository

Most Outreachy projects that interns work on have a single, main repository that code will
eventually be merged into. It can be any OCaml, open-source repository of code with some form
of issue tracker. For example, this summer we started with the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org][ocaml.org
repository]]. The best repositories tend to be those that
are well-maintained, make good use of the issue tracker, and have clear documentation that
describes how to get started.

Note that although companies can take part, the open-source project that is part of Outreachy
must be in the public interest. This generally means that OCaml libraries and tools of wider
interest are fine targets for Outreachy contributions, but not OCaml codebases that are
commercial or very specific in nature.

**** * Outreachy projects

[[https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#project-guidelines][Outreachy defines a good project]] for an intern as being
well-defined, self-contained, uncontroversial and incremental. When thinking of a suitable
project it is important to bear these conditions in mind.

Mentors can support the success of the intern by preparing, in advance, a three-month outline
of the timeline the intern will follow. This timeline divides the project into manageable
chunks that can be completed each week.

**** * Interacting with Outreachy interns

The interns' backgrounds may vary. Some might be experienced developers but most won't
already know OCaml and may have questions concerning the OCaml set-up or the langauge in
general. However, the project doesn't need to be super easy: many interns who started without
100% skill fit have been very successful.

Also, for most interns it's the first time contributing to open-source and they've all faced
systemic bias in the past. So it's important to provide a friendly working atmosphere. This
means being patient and making them feel comfortable to ask questions.

*** Step-by-step process for being a mentor

The Outreachy process from the mentor's perspective, including dates for the coming round is:

https://i.imgur.com/cI5GvF7.png

1. The Outreachy process starts when the call for *mentoring communities sign-up* opens. OCaml is already included in the next Outreachy round.

2. The next step is to [[https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/ocaml/][*submit Outreachy projects*]] to the OCaml community on the Outreachy site. That's the first step that you, as a potential mentor, would need to undertake. We've explained in the section above what a project can look like. At this stage, you also need to mention the skills that interns require to contribute to your project. This year's list of projects with their respective, required skills are [[https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-may-2021-internship-round/][available online]]. If you set your requirements too low, you might be overwhelmed by the number of applicants to your project; if you set it too high, you might not get any applicants. The section above, _Interacting with Outreachy interns_ describes the experience level you can expect.

3. If your project is approved, you should *prepare it for the _contribution period_*. At this stage, it's a good to review your contribution documentation and to label some of your project's issues as `good-first-issue` resp. `medium`.

4. The one month *_contribution period_* is the time during which Outreachy applicants, who have passed an _initial application_ process that's validated by the Outreachy organizers, can apply for a defined project by contributing to its repository in the same way that any other first-time contributer would contribute (independently from the internship project). This involves choosing issues, working on them and opening PRs, commenting on issues or opening new ones, and so on. During this stage, you need to start providing guidance and help. In particular, having `good-first-issue`'s is imperative since it allows the participants to become familiar with the code base. You must also have some `medium` sized issues or tasks for participants because it allows you to assess their application with more substantial contributions.

5. When the contribution period ends, you need to *select (an) intern(s)* out of the pool of applicants. To help you get an overview, each of them will submit an application consisting of the following two parts: a summary of their contributions to your repository during the contribution period and the [[https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#final-application][final application]] which includes a timeline for the internship project. The applicants are supposed to work out the timeline together with their mentor(s), so they might ask you for guidance and feedback in advance.

6. The interns will then be officially announced by Outreachy, and they start working with you a few weeks later, marking the start of their 13-week *internship period*!

*** Become a mentor

Mentoring an Outreachy intern is a very enriching experience! So if you have ideas, [[https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/ocaml/][submit
your project on the Outreachy website]],
under the OCaml community, and apply to be a mentor or co-mentor.

We are looking forward to your participation in the next Outreachy round(s) and would love to
hear your ideas (comment on the post)!

* JSOO build integration with JS front-end project?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/jsoo-build-integration-with-js-front-end-project/8226/1

** currycomb asked


I want to use JSOO to build a JS package that contains core logic that will run in a browser,
presenting a JSON-y API to be consumed by JS front-end code.  This seems like a good way to
use js_of_ocaml: all the complicated JS UI stuff doesn't need to be replicated in OCaml, but
you can still keep your core domain logic there.

I've got dune building my .js using JSOO and exposing functions to JS.  If I copy that JS by
hand to my front-end project, it works.  Now I want to be able to:

- Expose the output as something that my front-end project can bundle without a manual copying step
- Be able to make changes to in a dev environment and see the changes quickly in a browser

To do this with ReScript compiling my core ~.ml~ syntax project, I have ~esbuild~ running
under a watcher + ~rescript build -w~. I run ~rescript build -w~ on my front-end, with the
core project ~npm link~ed in.  Any change I make to either project (core or front-end) shows
up effectively immediately in the browser.

Has anybody got advice on how to get a similar setup working with JSOO compiling the core
project in place of ReScript, and JS on the front end?  Ideally on github, but otherwise
hints appreciated!
      

** Patrick Ferris replied


I took a stab at implementing something that could maybe be helpful, apologies if I
misinterpreted what you were asking, the repository is
[[https://github.com/patricoferris/jsoo-reload-example][jsoo-reload-example]]. I think the
README explains it quite well, but for completeness I'll add the general idea below.

#+begin_quote
Expose the output as something that my front-end project can bundle without a manual copying
step
#+end_quote

To achieve this I used the a dune rule with a copy action. The dependency is the output of
the jsoo build (~main.bc.js~) and the target is a new js file (~print.js~) in my project
directory. It is promoted automatically into that file and so if the jsoo is recompiled, this
copy happens right afterwards. I didn't commit the file but you could.

#+begin_quote
Be able to make changes to in a dev environment and see the changes quickly in a browser
#+end_quote

Now thanks to the previous setup running ~dune build -w~ will recompile the jsoo and copy it
over whenver you make a change to files your jsoo project requires.

All of the next part may not apply to your use case, but others might find it somewhat
useful. I used the [[https://parceljs.org/][parcel]] bundler (this is the only bundler I know
vaguely how to use) to then take the project and bundle it into a ~dist~ directory. Running
~parcel watch site/index.html~ concurrently with ~dune build -w~ now sets up a whole pipeline
from making a change to the jsoo to having a fresh, bundled output.

The final step for me (and again this probably doesn't apply) was to have live-reloading
server serve the contents of the bundled output. Using
[[https://github.com/aantron/dream][dream]],
[[https://github.com/tmattio/dream-livereload][dream-livereload]] and
[[https://github.com/mirage/irmin-watcher][irmin-watcher]] (an OCaml library for watching the
filesystem) I was able to achieve this (I'll leave out the details but everything is in the
~server~ directory), so now we have:

1. ~dune build -w~ notices a change to the jsoo and recompiles.
2. ~dune~ also then copies the jsoo output over to the project directory (in the example called ~site~).
3. The ~site~ directory has now changed triggering ~parcel~ to bundle the output to ~dist~.
4. ~dist~ has now changed triggering ~irmin-watcher~ which using ~dream~ and ~dream-livereload~ uses websockets to trigger a browser refresh.

That list should also set your expectations for how fast this all should be... not blazingly
fast, but sure beats manually copying and restarting things by hand, hope it helps :))
      



* Multicore OCaml: July 2021
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9
:END:

** Anil Madhavapeddy announced


Welcome to the July 2021 [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore][Multicore
OCaml]] monthly report! This month's
update along with the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly][previous updates]] has
been compiled by me, @ctk21, @kayceesrk and @shakthimaan. As August is usually a period of
downtime in Europe, the next update may be merged with the September one in a couple of
months (but given our geographically diverse nature now, if enough progress happens in August
I'll do an update).

The overall status of the multicore efforts are right on track: our contributions to the next
OCaml release have been [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-4-13-0-second-alpha-release/8164][incorporated in
4.13.0~alpha2]], and our
focus remains on crushing incompatibilities and bugs to generate domains-only parallelism
patches suitable for upstream review and release.  As a lower priority activity, we continue
to develop the experimental "effects-based" IO stack, which will feature in the upcoming
virtual OCaml Workshop at ICFP in August 2021.

The ~4.12.0+domains~ trees continue to see a tail of bugs being steadily fixed. After last
month's call, we saw a number of external contributors step up to submit fixes in addition to
the multicore and core OCaml teams. We would like to acknowledge and thank them!

- @emillon (Etienne Millon) for running the Jane Street ~core~ v0.14 test suite with 4.12.0+domains and sharing the test results (and finding a [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/624][multicore GC edge case bug]] while at it).
- @Termina1 (Vyacheslav Shebanov) for testing the compilation of ~batteries~ 3.30 with Multicore OCaml 4.12.0+domains.
- @nbecker (Nils Becker) for reporting on ~parallel_map~ and ~parallel_scan~ for domainslib.
- Filip Koprivec for identifying a memory leak when using ~flush_all~ with ~ocamlc~ with 4.12.0+domains.

All of these fixes, combined with some big-ticket compatibility changes (listed below) are
getting me pretty close to using 4.12.0+domains as my daily OCaml opam switch of choice. I
encourage you to also give it a try and report (good or bad) results on [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues][the multicore OCaml
tracker]].  If these sorts of
problems grab your attention, then [[https://segfault.systems/careers.html][Segfault Systems is hiring in
India]] to work with @kayceesrk and the team there on
multicore OCaml.

For benchmarking, the Jupyter notebooks for the Sandmark nightly benchmark runs have  been
updated, and we continue to test the Sandmark builds for the  4.12+ variants and
4.14.0+trunk. Progress has been made to integrate  ~current-bench~ OCurrent pipeline with the
Sandmark 2.0 -alpha branch  changes to reproduce the current Sandmark functionality, which
will allow GitHub PRs to be benchmarked systematically before being merged.

As always, the Multicore OCaml ongoing and completed tasks are listed first, which are then
followed by the updates from the Ecosystem libraries. The Sandmark nightly build efforts,
benchmarking updates and relevant current-bench tasks are then mentioned. Finally, the update
on the upstream OCaml Safepoints PR is provided for your reference.
