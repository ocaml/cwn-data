So far, I've been programming in ocaml using only sequential programs.
In my last project, which was an implementation of a large machine
learning algorithm, I tried to speed up computation using a little bit
of parallelism with ParMap, and it was a complete failure. It's possible
that more time would have yielded better results, but I just didn't have
the time to invest in it given how bad the initial results were.

My question is, what are the options right now as far as parallelism is
concerned? I'm not talking about cooperative multitasking, but about
really taking advantage of multiple cores. I'm well aware of the runtime
lock and I'm ok with message passing between processes or a shared area
in memory, but I'd rather have something more high level than starting
up several processes, creating a named pipe or a socket, and trying to
pass messages through that. Also, I assume that using a shared area in
memory involves some C code? Am I wrong about that?

I was expecting Core's Async to fill this role, but realworldocaml is
fuzzy on this topic, apparently preferring to dwell on cooperative
multitasking (which is fine but not what I'm looking for), and I couldn't
find any other documentation that was clearer.
      </pre><i>Yaron Minsky replied:</i><br /><pre>
This is indeed something that is not well covered in RWO.  That said,
the Async_parallel library is aimed at this kind of target.  No shared
memory region, just some automation around spinning up processes and
communicating jobs between them.
      </pre><i>Gerd Stolpmann also replied:</i><br /><pre>
There is Netmulticore, a part of Ocamlnet:

<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.7.3/doc/html-main/Intro.html#ch_comp">http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.7.3/doc/html-main/Intro.html#ch_comp</a>

It utilizes shared memory, and accesses it from several processes. There
is no C code involved, but it is fairly unsafe nevertheless, because you
need to stick to certain programming rules, or the program crashes.
However, if you manage to encapsulate all the unsafe things, it is a
good option. I'm using Netmulticore in the Plasma Map/Reduce
implementation.
      </pre><i>Yotam Barnoy then asked and Gerd Stolpmann replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Gerd, would it be possible to put netmulticore up on opam? I realize
&gt; this is a sensitive topic for you, but from what I can tell, this is
&gt; the most comprehensive and efficient solution to parallel programming
&gt; that exists for ocaml, so why not make it as easily available as
&gt; possible?

Netmulticore is part of Ocamlnet, and I guess you can get it by simply
installing ocamlnet with opam. I'm not the maintainer, so I don't know
whether it is included or not.

&gt; Also, regarding the ocaml_modify() and ocaml_initialize() regression
&gt; in 4.01 -- yikes! Is there any way to get support back for writing
&gt; outside of the ocaml heap? This seems like a pretty big deal! (Sorry
&gt; if I'm arriving late for whatever discussion took place about this
&gt; before).

There is a workaround in place - so far the OS supports it: thanks to
Xavier the symbols caml_modify and caml_initialize are declared as weak
in 4.01, allowing them to be redefined in executables. Netmulticore
redefines these symbols with their pre-4.01 functions.

This isn't optimal yet, because the old write barriers are a bit slower,
and because this introduces a very low-level dependency on the current
version of Ocaml. Nevertheless, it works for now. (Ideas for a better
solution are highly welcome.)
      </pre><i>Mark Shinwell then said and Gerd Stolpmann replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Jeremie Dimino and myself have a somewhat embryonic proposal
&gt; that should permit most of the write barrier to be
&gt; circumvented for out-of-heap access, and also avoid the page
&gt; table test.  We'll send mail to the list in due course once
&gt; we've had time to think about this further.

I'm very curious to hear about that.

So far I have only the idea to override the := operator selectively in
all modules that want to modify out-of-heap values:

let ( := ) = Netmcore_heap.assign h

where Netmcore_heap.assign is a C function that tests whether the
destination address is in the out-of-heap address space of h. If so, the
assignment can be done directly. If not, it just falls back to a normal
caml_modify.

This solution isn't nice, though, because it can be very problematic to
have the extra indirection of ref. So, what I'm searching for is a way
to turn any record mutation into an external C function call (or at
least to parametrize the write barrier somehow).
      </pre><i>Roberto Di Cosmo answered the original question:</i><br /><pre>
    there are regularly discussions on how to perform computations involving
parallelism on this list; a relatively recent and detailed one is 
 
    <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-06/msg00043.html">https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-06/msg00043.html</a>

And yes, one might be puzzled because there are so many different approaches,
but this is unavoidable, because there are so many different needs which are not
easily covered by a single approach.  If one wants to distribute a computation
that has very little data exchange compared to the local computation on each
node, the best approach is quite different to the one needed when large data
sets need to be shared or exchanged among the workers. And if you can do all on
a single machine, you can obtain significant speedup on a multicore machines by
exploiting OS level mechanisms that are not available if you need a cluster. Not
to mention the fact that in many cases one is looking for concurrency, and not
parallelism: even if at first sight they may look similar, deep down they really
are not.

Since you mention machine learning, it's quite probable that you want to perform
several iterations of relatively inexpensive computations on very large arrays
of integers or floats: if this is the case, Parmap (and not ParMap, that lends
to confusion with a different project in the Haskell world) was specially
designed to provide a highly efficient solution, and avoid boxing/unboxing
overhead of float arrays, *if* you use it properly (in particular, see the notes
at the end of the README file, or look at <a href="http://www.dicosmo.org/code/parmap/">http://www.dicosmo.org/code/parmap/</a>
and the research article pointed from there, where a precise discussion of the
steps involved in performing parallel computation on float arrays is given).
Actually, feedback from happy users, and synthetic benchmarks indicate that
Parmap should provide one of the best possible performances for this use case on
a multicore machine, short of resorting to using libraries like ancient, that
requires carefulness to avoid core dumps, or external libraries that already
have taken care of parallelism for you (like LaPack, etc.).

But if one performs a map over an array of floats *without* using
the special functions for floats, then all sort of boxing/unboxing and
copying will take place, and the "parallel" version might very well be
even slower than the sequential one, *if* the computation on each float
is fast.

Finally, if the float computations are the bottleneck, then a very interesting
project to keep an eye on is SPOC, that may significantly outperform everything
else on earth: taking advantage of the GPUs in your machine, it can perform
float computations on large arrays in a fraction of the time that your CPU,
even multicore, requires... but of course you need to learn to program a GPU
kernel for that. Learn more about this here <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc">http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc</a>

The bottonline is, parallelism is easier than concurrency, but when
one looks for speed, every detail counts, and getting a real speedup
does not come for free.

We would really need a single place where to share ideas, tips and serious
analysis of the various available approaches: multicore machines and GPUs are a
reality, and this issue is bound to come up again and again.
      </pre><i>Yotam Barnoy then said and Anil Madhavapeddy replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Regarding a place to share ideas, it seems like it would be very
&gt; useful to have an official ocaml wiki. Haskell has this and it's a
&gt; huge help. In fact, I would say haskell development would be greatly
&gt; hampered without it. There's so much information that's relevant to
&gt; more than one library ie. doesn't fit in any particular library's
&gt; documentation. It wouldn't be too hard to set up a wikimedia
&gt; instance on ocaml.org, would it? Alternatively it should be pretty
&gt; easy to set up something on wikia. This wiki would also be a great
&gt; place to describe the conceptual implementation of the compiler,
&gt; which is again what haskell has.

We do have a fledgling service for "domain-specific" conversations, in
the form of lists.ocaml.org. In fact, we set up a "wg-parallel" mailing
list last year, but never announced it for various reasons. This seems
like a good time to advertise its existence:

<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/">http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/</a>

(note that if anyone else would like an archived list on lists.ocaml.org
for a project or community group, then please do drop a line to
infrastructure@lists.ocaml.org to request it)

Regarding other services on ocaml.org, we (the "infrastructure team")
are happy to set them up, but please bear in mind that they all come
with a maintenance burden. Dealing with security issues, backups,
software updates, outages all take up time, and I confess a preference
for sipping martinis and hacking on code instead of sysadmin work.
Jeremy and Leo got tired of waiting for me to set up the wiki too, and
started:
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</a>

If you follow the links through there, there is a 'compiler internals'
page that would be good to contribute to, and you (or anyone else) is
extremely welcome to add more information on topics such as parallel
programming libraries there. I think we could have a decent stab at a
wiki.ocaml.org by backing it against a GitHub repository, and not have
to do any special hosting for it at all (the OPAM web pages work in a
similar fashion at the moment). But for now though, I'd recommend
focussing on the problem at hand (parallel programming) and getting some
information down somewhere, and less on the lack of a central wiki.
      </pre><i>Ashish Agarwal then added:</i><br /><pre>
Regarding the need for a wiki, why not create a new Parallel Programming
page under tutorials [1]. A "tutorial" can be as simple as listing the
libraries available and a brief description about the high level goal of
each.

Note ocaml.org is now almost entirely written in Markdown. A new page
can be written quite easily, see for example The Basics tutorial [2].

Absolutely!

I usually develop a sequential program working on a big list
and using List.iter or List.map.

When I am happy with the sequential program, I add an nprocs parameter
to use the Parmap equivalents when nprocs &gt; 1.

The only problems I have encountered were out of memory
in case the nprocs forks did not fit on my machine when
I handled too big data.

I usually handle independent pieces of data, for example
many proteins or chemical molecules.

More answers follow below.

There are MPI bindings for OCaml.

Gerd Stolpman's impressive ocamlnet library has nice pure OCaml wrappers
for all this I believe.

I believe Parmap and MPI are for parallelism (what you want
very probably), while Async/Lwt and OCaml threads are for concurrency
(used in webservers, GUIs, etc.).

We are happy to announce the new release of ReactiveML: <a href="http://reactiveml.org">http://reactiveml.org</a>.

ReactiveML is a language similar to OCaml extended with a built-in
notion of parallel composition. It is based on the reactive synchronous
model, a cooperative concurrency model.

The language is well suited to program applications with a lot of
parallel processes which communicate and synchronize a lot such as video
games or simulation problems.

ReactiveML is compiled into plain OCaml code and thus can link or be
linked to any OCaml code.

This new version includes among others the following feature:
- a new programming construct "signal/memory" which helps in particular
to program concurrent data structures.

ReactiveML can be installed from the sources:

     the short story is that we need help in packaging for Mac OSX and Windows
some specialised solvers that can be used with opam, and are already packaged
for Debian: aspcud, mccs and packup, with aspcud being the highest priority.

The Debian packages, built by Ralf Treinen, are a good entry point for any
volunteer, as they contain the pointer to the upstream source, list the
C/C++ libraries and other dependencies involved, and contain useful patches
not yet integrated upstream; even if you do not have a Debian (or Ubuntu)
machine at hand, most of the information is available here

   aspcud : <a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/aspcud">http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/aspcud</a>
   mccs   : <a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/mccs">http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/mccs</a>
   packup : <a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/packup">http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/packup</a>

If you are willing to help with this work, please post a comment under the
corresponding issues opened on github, and say to what part of the effort
you whish to contribute, so we can have some basic coordination among
the volunteers.

   aspcud : <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1074">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1074</a>
   mccs   : <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1075">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1075</a>
   packup : <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1076">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1076</a>

Now, here comes the long story, that might be of interest for you even if
you are just a regular user of opam.

As you might know, the opam package manager incorporates state-of-the-art
technology that has been developed for managing packages in GNU/Linux
distributions in the Mancoosi project (www.mancoosi.org), and uses the
libcudf and dose libraries from it.

A key point of the approach which we set forth in Mancoosi (for the interested
reader, see [1,2] below), is that a modern package manager should clearly
separate a platform specific front-end from a platform independent back-end in
charge of solving dependencies in order to perform upgrades or downgrades
according to the user's preferences. 

Using the CUDF format as a pivot, we can share the effort of developing
efficient solvers among multiple package managers, and can even use different
solvers in the same package manager if the default one hits its limits (which
*can* happen, as dependency solving is an NP-complete problem). This is actually
possible today in Debian: you can call apt-get with the option --solver SOLVER
where SOLVER can be aspcud, mccs or packup.

User preferences are an important, and often overlooked concept: when you 
request the installation of a package, there might be many ways of satisfying
it, and a user should be able to state, for example, whether he is a "trendy"
person that prefers to see all other packages upgraded to the latest possible
version at the same time, or on the contrary, a "paranoid" person that wants
to change them as little as possible.

This is why all CUDF compliant solvers allow to specify user preferences by
combining lexicographically keyworks like "new", "changed", "removed", "notuptodate";
for example, a trendy person will use as preference

   -removed,-notuptodate,-new

meaning "please minimise the number of removed packages, and then the number
of packages that are not at their latest version, and finally the number of
package that were not already present"

While a paranoid person would use

   -removed, -changed

meaning "please minimise the number of removed packages, and then the number of
packages that are modified (installed/removed/upgraded/downgraded)".

Actually, the criteria supported by the CUDF solvers evolved over time, and 
aspcud supports nowadays a more sophisticated preference language
(see <a href="http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/criteria/">http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/criteria/</a>), but all of "new",
"changed", "removed" and "notuptodate" can be encoded in the latest version,
and aspcud as packaged for Debian accepts them right away.

The good news is that opam has built-in support to use aspcud as an external
CUDF-compliant solver too: if aspcud is installed on your machine, then
dependency solving will be delegated to aspcud, and the default preferences are
set to -removed,-notuptodate,-new.

You can change these preferences if needed by just setting the OPAMCRITERIA
environment variable, and you can ask opam not to use the external solver
with the option --no-aspcud (that should really be --no-external-solver).

Now that the opam users are hitting the limits of the internal solver embedded
in opam, it is important to have CUDF compliant solvers available on all platforms:
aspcud is a priority because it can be used by opam right away (no need to change
even a single line of code), but packup and mccs are important too, as with little
changes in the opam code one will be able to choose which solver to use.

So, to sum up:

 - if you are running Debian (or a Debian-based distribution, like Ubuntu), lucky you,
   just apt-get install aspcud and you are all set; you can even play with OPAMCRITERIA
   to adjust the solutions to your needs, and you can use --no-aspcud if you want to
   see the difference with the internal solver

 - if you are on another platform, stay tuned for when packages for aspcud/packup/mccs
   will be available on your platform
