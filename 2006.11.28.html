I've made a small bindings for inotify, aka linux file system notification 
new subsystem. 

It's available here: 

<a href="http://tab.snarc.org/projects/ocaml_inotify/">http://tab.snarc.org/projects/ocaml_inotify/</a> 

or the archive is directly here: 

<a href="http://tab.snarc.org/download/ocaml/ocaml_inotify-0.2.tar.bz2">http://tab.snarc.org/download/ocaml/ocaml_inotify-0.2.tar.bz2</a> 

You need a really recent glibc to have inotify syscall available 
through /usr/include/sys/inotify.h. I didn't bother putting some code 
to handle old glibc, but I accept patch :) 

The archive contains an example program on how to use the interface.

I think OMake includes bindings for gamin.  Or FAM which is the older 
SGI-based daemon, but gamin is C API compatible with FAM.

it seems to be talking FAM.

Sounds more like a bad thing than a good thing to me. 
Direct inotify binding are much smaller/simpler anyway.

In C, if you are really concerned about getting your exact constants up 
to the last bit, you should use the hexadecimal float notation 
introduced in C99. You should also use "%a" or "%A" to print out your 
floating-point values in hexadecimal if you intend to reload them on 
another IEEE-754 system in a portable way. 
(Unfortunately on OCaml, %a is already used for another use... Xavier, 
what do you think of adding the hexadecimal float conversion to the 
family of printf functions?) 

Anyway, "IEEE-754 compliant", as used by common vendors, is a fairly 
vague claim. For instance, contrary to a commonly held belief, the same 
C or Caml program ran on two different major platforms (say, IA32 vs 
AMD64 or IA32 vs PowerPC) can give different results, possibly even 
depending on compiler options, and this has nothing to do with how they 
parse constants... You might wish to read my preprint: 
<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/biblio/pitfalls_of_floating_point.pdf">http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/biblio/pitfalls_of_floating_point.pdf</a> 

The only widespread language that I know about that has fixed semantics 
for floating-point is Java if the 'strictfp' modifier is used. 
(Originally, Java was supposed to have a fully fixed semantics, but they 
realized that implementing it over the 80387 compatible floating-point 
stack was difficult and that it also precluded some optimizations, so 
they relaxed it by default and introduced 'strictfp'. Goodbye 
predictability.)

In the Astrée project, we use some small C functions and OCaml wrappers 
to change rounding modes. It's not easy (some systems have 
fpgetround/fpsetround, others fegetround/fesetround, some have none and 
you have to use assembly, and old versions of GNU libc on IA32 have 
fegetround/fesetround that change rounding for the 387 FPU but not for 
SSE, which may break some external C libraries). 
[ Hey, we should publish our libraries. ] 
In addition, some C libraries don't work properly when rounding is not 
"round to nearest". I filed bugs against FreeBSD libc (printf doesn't 
work properly with some arguments) and GNU libc (pow() does not work 
properly). 

Rounding modes other than the default "round to nearest" tend to be 
largely untested on many systems and libraries, because few people use 
them. #pragma FENV_ACCESS is not even implemented on gcc; 
-frounding-math is supposed to signal rounding modes other than round to 
nearest, but the documentation states that it's not even sure it works... 

Not that I want to advertise myself too much, but I think you should read 
<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/biblio/pitfalls_of_floating_point.pdf">http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/biblio/pitfalls_of_floating_point.pdf</a> 
if you are concerned about interactions between compilers and 
floating-point.
