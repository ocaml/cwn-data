** Rudi Grinberg announced


The dune team is pleased to announce the bug fix release of Dune 1.6.3. Normally, we don't bother announcing all bug fix releases, but this one contains quite a few fixes. I'd like to take this opportunity to encourage everyone to upgrade. Cheers.

*** 1.6.3 (08/01/2019)

- Fix merlin handling of private module visibility (#1653 @bobot)

- skip directories when looking up programs in the PATH (#1628, fixes #1616, @diml)

- Fix preprocessing for libraries with ~(include_subdirs ..)~ (#1624, fix #1626, @nojb, @rgrinberg)

- Do not generate targets for archive that don't match the ~modes~ field. (#1632, fix #1617, @rgrinberg)

- When executing actions, open files lazily and close them as soon as possible in order to reduce the maximum number of file descriptors opened by Dune (#1635, #1643, fixes #1633, @jonludlam, @rgrinberg, @diml)

- Do not generate targets for archive that don't match the ~modes~ field. (#1632, fix #1617, @rgrinberg)

- Get the correct environment node for multi project workspaces (#1648, @rgrinberg)

- Fix an issue causing menhir generated parsers to fail to build in some cases. The fix is to systematically use ~-short-paths~ when calling ~ocamlc -i~ (#1743, fix #1504, @diml)
