Lascar-0.6-alpha
════════════════

jserot announced
────────────────

  This is to announce the availability of version 0.6 of `Lascar', a
  library for manipulating Labeled Transition Systems in OCaml.

  This release is essentially a repackaging to support building and
  installing with `dune' and removing the dependency on `camlp4'.

  `Lascar' is available in source code from [github] or as a [opam
  package].

Lwt 4.3.0 — preparing for 5.0.0
═══════════════════════════════

Anton Bachin announced
──────────────────────

  We are pleased to announce release *4.3.0* of [*Lwt*], the promise and
  concurrent I/O library. It is now installable from opam:

  ┌────
  │ opam update && opam upgrade lwt
  └────

  <https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt>

  Lwt 4.3.0 is a relatively small release, offering a few
  improvements. However, it announces several new breaking changes for
  the upcoming Lwt 5.0.0. Everything is detailed in the [*full
  changelog*]. Lwt 5.0.0 is planned for November 2019, three months from
  now.

  The breaking changes are relatively minor and should affect few
  users. About half are simply removing unused features, some of which
  are experimental features that never matured.

  There are two breaking changes planned for 5.0.0 that are probably
  relevant to everyone:

  1. The signature of [`Lwt.async'] will become
     ┌────
     │ Lwt.async : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit
     └────

     See [#603].

  2. [`Lwt.choose'], [`Lwt.pick'], and similar functions, will raise
     `Invalid_argument' if called with an empty list. Right now, they
     return a promise that never resolves. See [#562].

  Happy concurrent programming!

Are there any OCaml podcasts out there?

Ozan Sener asked
────────────────

  Over the last two years OCaml has become my favorite language to
  program in. Decades of resources, open source projects, mailing list
  posts and IRC/Discord logs all helped me develop a taste for ML and
  build real things that were previously out of my comfort
  zone. Unfortunately, I'm currently not in a circle where I can tap
  into know-how of experienced OCaml developers, and I feel like I'm
  missing out.

  I've been listening to <https://reason.town/> lately, and I really
  like the casual format. Do you have anything similar, on any medium,
  that you are following?


Yawar Amin replied
──────────────────

  I've never heard of an OCaml-specific podcast but I think sometimes
  OCamlers go on as guests in other podcasts. One that I enjoyed was
  @avsm on FLOSS Weekly talking about Mirage and OCaml
  <https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/302>

  There was also a series of podcasts done during the December 2017
  MirageOS hack retreat:
