01) Generating module lists automatically
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yaron Minsky asked and Sylvain Le Gall answered:

&gt; Does anyone have a reasonable solution to the problem of automatically
&gt; generating dependencies and topologically sorted module lists for
&gt; executables?  omake seems to do a good job for managing dependencies
&gt; between automatically, but I don't see any good way of generating a
&gt; topologically sorted list of names automatically within omake.  Camlmake
&gt; (<a href="http://www.davidb.org/camlmake/">http://www.davidb.org/camlmake/</a>) seems to be the right kind of thing, but
&gt; does not appear to be maintained anymore.  I'm wondering if there are any
&gt; other good options out there.

You also may take a look at the cameleon CVS. Just look at the different
Makefile, master.Makefile.in + the dir utils/ ( which contains
ocamldep-extract, which is a very simple program to sort
module list to compile your code ). The rest of the system ( Makefile +
master.Makefile.in ) permits to extract all dependency ( included zoggy
file, mly, mll, + file with special syntax... ).

For now, it is only a simple system of Makefile. If you have any comment
send it to me... I will read them with a lot of care.

02) Class polymorphism
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** A very long thread about the complexity of class polymorphism has started 
** here: <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200308/msg00226.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200308/msg00226.html</a>
** Here are a couple messages from this long thread.

** Benjamin Geer asked:

I'm looking for a convenient way to use a derived class anywhere its
base class can be used.  There seem to be two ways to do this, but
neither of them is convenient.

For example, suppose I have the following examples (borrowed from the
O'Reilly Caml book):

class virtual printable () =
   object (self)
     method virtual to_string : unit -&gt; string
     method print () = print_string (self#to_string())
   end ;;

class point (x_init, y_init) =
  object
    inherit printable ()
    val mutable x = x_init
    val mutable y = y_init
    method get_x = x
    method get_y = y
    method to_string () =
      "( " ^ (string_of_int x) ^ ", " ^ (string_of_int y) ^")"
  end ;;

I want to make a class 'printer', which prints the string representation
of any 'printable'.  It seems that I have two options:

1. Write 'printer' like this:

class printer =
  object
    method print (obj : printable) = obj#print()
  end ;;

And use it like this:

let p = new point (1, 2) ;;
let pr = new printer ;;
pr#print (p :&gt; printable) ;;

It is cumbersome to have to write the coercion, and it seems strange to
have to do so in an object-oriented language; why can't Caml recognise 
that a 'point' is a 'printable', and do the coercion automatically?

Moreover, it introduces a potential maintenance problem.  Suppose that,
after writing the application, I decide to to move the printing logic
out of 'printable', and into the 'printer' class.  I refactor the
classes like this:

class virtual stringable () =
   object
     method virtual to_string : unit -&gt; string
   end ;;

class virtual printable () =
   object (self)
     inherit stringable ()
     method print () = print_string (self#to_string())
   end ;;

class printer =
  object
    method print (obj : stringable) = print_string (obj#to_string())
  end ;;

But now I have to change all the coercions from (p :&gt; printable) to (p
:&gt; stringable).  If it had been legal to write:

let p = new point (1, 2) ;;
let pr = new printer ;;
pr#print p ;;

there would be nothing more to change; all the calls to 'pr#print' would
still work.

2. The second option is to write 'printer' like this:

class printer =
  object
    method print : 'a. (#printable as 'a) -&gt; unit =
      fun obj -&gt; obj#print()
  end ;;

This syntax is horribly awkward.  It would be very unpleasant to have to
write (or read) a lot of methods in this style.  Moreover, it seems
strange to have to do this, because I can write a function like this:

let print (obj : #printable) = obj#print() ;;

Or even:

let print obj = obj#print() ;;

So why can't I write:

class printer =
  object
    method (obj : #printable) = obj#print()
  end ;;

Or even:

class printer =
  object
    method obj = obj#print()
  end ;;

Why isn't a method just like a function in this respect?

Of course, I could write 'printer' as a function instead of a class.
But this would lead to an approach in which objects are manipulated only
by functions, and never by other objects.  If that were really the only
convenient way to use classes in Caml, it would be difficult to say that
Caml supported object-oriented programming.

So my questions are:

Does it really need to be this complicated?  Could the language be
improved so that either (1) explicit coercions to a base class were not
needed or (b) methods could use types the way functions do?

Is there a more convenient approach that I've missed?  What do people
generally do in order to get round this problem, when using classes in Caml?

** Brian Hurt said:

&gt; class printer =
&gt;    object
&gt;      method print (obj : printable) = obj#print()
&gt;    end ;;

Instead of declaring obj to be printable, why not just declare that it has
a function print?  Like:

class printer =
    object
        method print (obj: &lt;print: unit-&gt;unit&gt;) = obj#print ();
    end;;

This removes the need for a coercion, as it gets around the need to
upcast.

** Benjamin Geer asked and Jacques Garrigue answered:

&gt; Why is upcasting necessary, given that inheritance relationships are
&gt; known at compile time?  Could Caml be modified to correct this problem?
&gt;   Is any work currently being done on this?

Upcasting is needed because type inference in ocaml does not include
subtyping. There is work on type inference with subtyping, but it
would create much more complicated types, even for usual functions
which do not involve objects. Personally I don't think there is a
strong hope of combining full ML type inference with subtyping in a
practical programming language.

Now, ocaml tries to avoid the problem by providing something similar
to subtyping, but through ML polymorphism. This is the #printable
types. This is not exactly subtyping (in some cases an instance of
#printable is not a subtype of printable) but it is actually sometimes
closer to the notion of "usable in place of".

When using functions, this approach using "open rows" works well.
However there is a problem with methods.

&gt; Why can't methods be polymorphic in the way that functions can be?

Methods are part of an object. In normal ML this means that the
polymorphism can only appear at the level of the object, not at the
level of the method (ML only allows outermost polymorphism).
As an additional twist, since in ocaml a class definition also defines
a type, all polymorphic variables must be explicitely declared as
parameters to the class, otherwise you get the dreaded
  Some type variables are unbound in this type

Anyway, what you want in many cases is not the object, but the method
to be polymorphic: you want to be able to apply the same method of the
same object to values of different types.

This is now possible with the introduction of polymorphic methods, but
only with a rather heavy syntax.
There are several reasons to that:
* since the "normal" behaviour would be to restrict the polymorphism
  to the object level, choosing to apply it automatically at the
  method level would be an arbitrary decision.
* contrary to functions, whose types are instantiated before
  unification, object method types have to be unified with their
  polymorphic variables not instantiated (because an object with a
  polymorphic method can be passed around, while only an instance of a
  polymorphic function would be passed around). This means that the
  "most general type" we would infer for a method would give rise to an
  object type incompatible with less general types. Not a good
  property for inference.
* last, by explicitely declaring a polymorphic type we make it
  possible to call it polymorphically from other methods in the same
  object. This seems to be a nice property to have between methods.
  You cannot do that with functions defined in the same "let rec"
  statement.

&gt; At the very least, would it be possible to add some syntactic sugar,
&gt; so we could write:
&gt;
&gt; method process (obj : #thing) -&gt; (* ... *)
&gt;
&gt; instead of:
&gt;
&gt; method process : 'a . (#thing as 'a ) -&gt; unit =
&gt;    fun obj -&gt; (* ... *)

To speak truly, the current syntax is based on the assumption that you
won't define often polymorphic methods, and that defining them is a
work for library designers, not for the average end user.

This also means that you have a number of workarounds hiding this
heavy syntax to the end user, even when he has to define such a
method.

For instance you could be provided a virtual class printer:

class virtual printer : object
  method virtual print : #printable -&gt; unit
  method ...
end

Then you would use it as

class my_printer () = object
  inherit printer
  method print obj = ...
end

There is no need to write type information on the inheriting side.
You will get an error message if your method is not polymorphic
enough.

Another remark is that, when the only goal of the polymorphism is to
allow subtyping of the argument, the workaround of using an auxiliary
function as suggested by Brian Rogoff makes perfectly sense, and
avoids getting involved in the details of the object system.

class printer () = object
  method print (obj : printable) = ...
end

let print ~(printer : #printer) obj =
  printer#print (obj : #printable :&gt; printable)
val print : printer:#printer -&gt; #printable -&gt; unit

Now the print function has a type polymorphic enough, and using it
makes clear you are using the print method of a printer, not of an
arbitrary object (which might have a completely unrelated print
method). This is more precise, and does the work in the traditional ML
way.

03) ant 0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Achim Blumensath announced:

I'm pleased to announce the release of ant version 0.5. The archive can
be found at

  <a href="http://www-mgi.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~blume/Download.html">http://www-mgi.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~blume/Download.html</a>

ant is a typesetting system inspired by TeX. It does not aim at complete
compatibility with TeX but focuses instead on a flexible, clean, and
modular design.

ant implements most parts of TeX. The new release consists mostly of
various small improvements. New features include:

  o colours and images
  o improved font handling including font encodings
  o hyphenation for several languages
  o PDF output (only bitmap fonts though)

The main missing item is support for insertions (i.e., floats and
footnotes).

Achim

PS: Yes, I do know about Apache Ant.

04) Parameterizing multiple modules using functors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yaron Minsky asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; Here's the issue.  Consider a project consisting of multiple modules with
&gt; lots of interdependencies.   Imagine then that I want to add some
&gt; flexibility to the system by abstracting out some of the structure of the
&gt; system using a functor.  Thus, I start out with modules A, B, C, and I
&gt; want to parameterize all these modules, let's say by the same module X.
&gt; So what I want is a version of the program where I can use A.F(X) intead
&gt; of A, B.F(X) instead of B, and so on.  The problem is that I want to allow
&gt; references between these modules.  Thus, B.F(X) needs access to A.F(X),
&gt; and C.F(X) needs access to both A.F(X) and B.F(X).  The question is, is
&gt; there a reasonable way to achieve this?

There are two approaches, but I'm not sure you'll find them "reasonable".
One is as you described:

&gt; I can think of an unreasonable way.  I can write the relevant functors so
&gt; that they can be embedded in a unified module U as follows:
&gt;
&gt; module U =
&gt; struct
&gt;    module A = A.F(X)
&gt;    module B = B.F(A,X)
&gt;    module C = C.F(A,B,X)
&gt; end
&gt;
&gt; In other words, B and C and require in their functors explicit arguments
&gt; corresponding to the other modulse they need.  This works, but it's
&gt; awfully ugly, not least because you have to write down some awful module
&gt; signatures in B and C to make this work.

The other is to write:

module F (X: SIGX) =
  struct
    module A = ...
    module B = ...
    module C = ...
  end

This way, B and C automatically reference A as instantiated for X.
You do lose separate compilation of A, B and C, though.  You can still
put A, B and C in separate files and generate the code above from the
files, perhaps with the use of a literate programming tool, but the
generated file will have to be recompiled entirely every time one of
the sub-modules change.

05) RSS feed for the CWN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Alan Schmitt announced:

I am pleased to announce that the Caml Weekly News archive is now also
available as a RSS feed (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/cwn.rss">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/cwn.rss</a>)
which will be updated every Tuesday, when the CWN is released. This feed
is also integrated into the News tab of the MozCaml sidebar
(<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mozcaml/">http://caml.inria.fr/mozcaml/</a>).

<a name="6"/>==============================================================================
06) GD4O - Alpha 4 / Sourceforge project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Matt Gushee announced:

The fourth alpha version of the GD4O library has been released.
Significant new developments include:

  * partial support for extended TrueType rendering (gdImageStringFTEx
    in the C API). Multiline text is supported, but double-byte character
    strings will require an alternative to the standard string type,
    which is currently used to pass string arguments to the TrueType
    rendering methods.

  * new SAFER compile flag enables conditional compilation of safety
    measures such as strict argument checking in the C wrapper code.

I have also created a SourceForge project for GD4O. The project home
page remains at

  <a href="http://havenrock.com/software/gd4o/">http://havenrock.com/software/gd4o/</a>

but package downloads have been moved to SourceForge, and the CVS tree
will be moved to SourceForge within the next few days. If you would like
to visit the SourceForge project page, its URL is

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gd4o/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gd4o/</a>

And if you are interested in joining the project, please let me know.
Developers with experience in interfacing OCaml with C are particularly
needed.

07) GlSurf 2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Christophe Raffalli announced:

I am pleased to announce the release 2.0 of GlSurf
<a href="http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~raffalli/glsurf">http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~raffalli/glsurf</a>

It now works under Windows (I distribute binary version :-)
Feel free to test it and reports problem.

--
GlSurf is a program (similar to Surf (<a href="http://surf.sourceforge.net">http://surf.sourceforge.net</a>)) to
draw 3D surfaces and 3D curves from their implicit equations (that is
drawing the set of points (x,y,z) such that f(x,y,z) = 0).

It offers an intuitive and simple syntax to construct your functions,
it can draw multiple surfaces simultaneously and it can use all the
power of OpenGl to animate the surface, use transparency, etc ...

GlSurf is a ``command interpreter'': you type some commands and it
executes them !

A good way to use GlSurf is to write a sequence of command in a file
and the type "glsurf file" to execute all the commands.

08) DOMINOCAML release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Charles-Albert Lehalle announced:

The first public release of DOMINOCMAL is avalable at sourceforge :
<a href="http://phimatex.sf.net/dominocaml.html">http://phimatex.sf.net/dominocaml.html</a>

It's the first time I use object with ocaml, so if people can read some of
my files (only 1.500 LOC) and give me feedback, he will be welcome.

DOMINOCAML is an ocaml GPL software aimed to explore aspects of the
dominoes game.
Actually, it can :
- compute statistics on domino gaming
- simulate games between automated players
- play games between humans and automated players
 
If new developpers want to join its developpment, dominocaml will become a
sourceforge project on its own.

Actually it needs :
- a pretty GUI (may be developped in anoter language)
- add some strategies
- support of networked games

<a name="9"/>==============================================================================
09) IBGS 0.2 Release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Christoph Bauer announced:

there is a new release of IBGS, the Internet Board Game Server.

The IBGS package contains a game server and a client.  At the moment
only chess as game type is supported.

The protocol of the server is compatible to the ICS protocol aka
"style12" (used by fics, gics, ...; supported by xboard, winboard, 
...).

A test server runs on chess.unix-ag.uni-kl.de, port 5050. Usage is
free, source code licence is GPL.

OCaml developer may interested in the chess module. It
has
  * a move generator
  * parsing routines (ICS, PGN)
  * SQL chess database support

Despite of the version number this module is quite stable.

There is a weak chess engine written with this module. This engine
plays online on the GICS server. This handle is known as "Mjoelnir" or
"NullMove".  The source code comes with the IBGS package
(plugins/chess/examples/mjoelnir).

Highlights of the new IBGS release are
  * new SQL Backends (postgres, sqlite)
  * new rating system
  * improved IBGS Client

More information are on:

10) taggage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Issac Trotts announced:

A new Vim-oriented tag file generator for OCaml is available at 
<a href="http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/taggage-1.1.ml">http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/taggage-1.1.ml</a>

** He also added:

Re: Karl Zilles' question about how taggage compares to otags.  otags
uses camlp4 macros to convert abstract syntax trees into tag files.
taggage uses regular expressions, uses no camlp4, and has many fewer
lines of code.

<a name="11"/>==============================================================================
11) automated binding generation (announce: Forklift)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Jeff Henrikson announced:

Forklift is a program for generating language bindings based on C
header files.  It is similar in concept to SWIG or CamlIDL.  Below I
append the features and limitations from the README file.  Forklift
originally grew out of frustration trying to write an OCaml SWIG
language module about 18 months ago.  After 2000 lines of C for SWIG, I
became convinced that I wasn't going to get what I wanted.  So now
there is a new program that attempts to get what I want.  Features
include a pleasing stub composition model for higher order type
converters.

This is a pre-alpha release.  Your feedback is solicited.  See the
"limitations" section for disclaimers.

Cheers,


Jeff Henrikson

<a href="http://jhenrikson.org/forklift/">http://jhenrikson.org/forklift/</a>


FEATURES (aka "What makes Forklift different?")

    -&gt;  Forklift generates foreign function interface stubs based on
        reading C header files intact, without annotation.  IDL and SWIG
        also make stubs from header files, but they do so by requiring
        inline modifications to the source code, making any stub
        preparation irrelevant when version 2.0 of the header files
        are released.  Forklift's annotations are kept as separate input
        files.

    -&gt;  Forklift, like SWIG, works with C code stubs rather than an
        exhaustive grammar for describing every possible type.  This
        makes it more flexible and allows it to describe multiple
        representations for the same data.

    -&gt;  Forklift requires enough structure of the C code to provide
        higher order type representations.  For example, given a way
        to convert "int" variables, one can provide an abstract
        way to convert arrays such that an int array conversion
        can be generated.

    -&gt;  Forklift's stub algebra admits full n variables -&gt; k variables
        transformation generality.  For example we can map an (int,
int*)
        pair in consecutive parameters to a HLL int array, where the
        the first is taken to mean the length and the second a pointer.

    -&gt;  Forklift provides for a rich pattern matching vocabulary, not
        simply equality matching on variable names.

    -&gt;  Forklift generates constructors, destructors and accessors
        for data structures automatically.  A flexible set of
        options allow choices between single accessors vs bulk
        accessors, read-only vs read-write accessors, etc.  For
        languages which support finalization, finalization methods
        can be generated.

    -&gt;  Forklift can be (and for the time being must be!) run as
        an interactive session, typically as an emacs inferior
        buffer.  Its utility functions allow the user to query the
        header files instead of reading them.  So one can ask "what
        functions pass a pointer to this structure as a first
        parameter?" and get an exhaustive list of function
        identifiers.  This saves laborious reading, copy-pasting,
        and editing.


LIMITATIONS

    --  The callback module hasn't been written yet.

    --  Forklift currently only implements an Objective Caml
        language module.

    --  Forklift currently free-rides on ocaml syntax, using the
        toplevel as its interaction environment.  In the future it will
        have its own interactive language-agnostic syntax.

    --  A C preprocessor emulator is not yet written, so header files
        must be manually run through cpp.

    --  IDL orthogonality has not yet been analyzed.


PREREQUISITES

        Forklift requires:

        ocaml &gt;= 3.06, pcre, ocaml-pcre, ocaml emacs mode.

12) OCaml test release 3.07 beta 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Xavier Leroy announced:

Many of you provided very useful feedback on the pre-release 3.07 beta 1
of OCaml.  Thanks!  Since this beta-test worked so well, we're now
making available a beta 2 pre-release of what should very soon become
the next stable release of Objective Caml.  It is available for
testing at

        <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib-3.07beta2.html">http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib-3.07beta2.html</a>

The modifications since beta 1 are almost exclusively bug fixes.  The
only programmer-visible change affects the typing of polymorphic
variants in pattern matching (see change log below).  So, we're
especially looking for testers who intensively use polymorphic variants
in their code.

As usual, this is a source-only release, and feedback is much
appreciated: bug reports to caml-bugs@inria.fr, and "everything is OK"
messages to caml@inria.fr.

Barring major problems, the final 3.07 release should be essentially
identical to this beta 2, and released second week of september.

- Xavier Leroy

--------------------------------------------------

Changes since 3.07 beta 1:

Type-checking:
- The typing of polymorphic variants in pattern matching has changed.
  It is intended to be more regular, sticking to the principle of "closing
  only the variants which would be otherwise incomplete". Two potential
  consequences: (1) some types may be left open which were closed before,
  and the resulting type might not match the interface anymore (expected to
  be rare); (2) in some cases an incomplete match may be generated.

Toplevel interactive system:
- Look for .ocamlinit file in home directory in addition to the current dir.

Standard library:
- Module Lexing: added function Lexing.flush_input.

Emacs mode:
- Improved display of inferred type information produced by ocamlc -dtypes.

the archive (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/</a>) or the RSS feed of the 
archives (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/cwn.rss">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/cwn.rss</a>). If you also wish to 
receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
