  After a couple of requests, I’ve refreshed the opam2 PPA
  infrastructure to make binary packages available for more variants of
  Ubuntu for the latest stable release of opam (2.0.2). The new support
  for Ubuntu Trusty and Xenial builds means that the ppa can be used
  with Travis CI for non-container based builds.  Travis does not
  currently support Bionic, and so Xenial is the latest available there.

  In order to support these older distros, I've also packaged up
  Bubblewrap for the older Ubuntu distributions.  This is of course an
  unofficial backport, so let me know if you run into any problems with
  it.

  The packages currently sit in my PPA tree at [avsm/ppa-opam], and can
  be used by simple adding:

  ┌────
  │ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
  │ sudo apt-get update
  │ sudo apt-get -y install opam
  └────

  to your CI scripts.

  Sources to the scripts and more information in the README:

  If anyone would like to help with including opam 2 in more upstream
  distributions, please [refer to the distributions wiki ] and pick your
  favourite OS :slight_smile:

  @ostera has started live-casting programming sessions on major OCaml
  libraries, written in Reason syntax (which is easy enough for OCamlers
  to understand). Highly recommended!

  His twitch videos are [here]. Make sure to show up and chat for his
  live streams!  For posterity (since twitch deletes old videos), his
  youtube channel is [here].

  I'd love to see more of this kind of thing from the community – new
  users are much more likely to want to watch a fun programming session
  than to read something.
