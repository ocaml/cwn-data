  `=============================================================================='
  BOB Conference 2023
  “What happens when we use what’s best for a change?”
  <https://bobkonf.de/2023/cfc.html>
  Berlin, Mar 17
  Call for Contributions
  Deadline: November 21, 2022
  `=============================================================================='

  You are actively engaged in advanced software engineering methods,
  solve ambitious problem with software and are open to cutting-edge
  innovation? Attend this conference, meet people that share your goals,
  and get to know the best software tools and technologies available
  today. We strive to offer a day full of new experiences and
  impressions that you can use to immediately improve your daily life as
  a software developer.

  If you share our vision and want to contribute, submit a proposal for
  a talk or tutorial!

  NOTE: The conference fee will be waived for presenters. Travel
  expenses will not be covered (for exceptions see “Speaker Grants”).


Online or Onsite
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  We expect we’ll be able to hold BOB 2023 in Berlin. Note that we
  intend to provide a safe environment for all participants. There will
  be space outside to eat and chat. We may ask you to wear a mask
  indoors when not presenting or eating, and may also ask you to take a
  COVID test on-site before the event.

  If an on-site BOB is not possible, we’ll make BOB a successful online
  event, like BOB 2021 and BOB 2022. Should BOB happen online, we will
  likely ask for pre-recorded talks to make room for questions and
  social interactions during the actual conference day. (Of course,
  we’ll provide assistance making those recordings.) Tutorials will
  likely happen as a live-session.


Shepherding
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The program committee offers shepherding to all speakers. Shepherding
  provides speakers assistance with preparing their sessions.
  Specifically:

  • advice on structure and presentation
  • review of talk slides
  • assistance with recording
  • review of recording, if applicable


Speaker Grants
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  BOB has Speaker Grants available to support speakers from groups
  under-represented in technology. We specifically seek women speakers,
  speakers of color, and speakers who are not able to attend the
  conference for financial reasons.


Topics
╌╌╌╌╌╌

  We are looking for talks about best-of-breed software technology,
  e.g.:

  • functional programming
  • persistent data structures and databases
  • event-based modelling and architecture
  • “fancy types” (dependent types, gradual typing, linear types, …)
  • formal methods for correctness and robustness
  • abstractions for concurrency and parallelism
  • metaprogramming
  • probabilistic programming
  • math and programming
  • controlled side effects
  • program synthesis
  • next-generation IDEs
  • effective abstractions for data analytics
  • … everything really that isn’t mainstream, but you think should be
  • … includeing rough ideas worth discussing.

  Presenters should provide the audience with information that is
  practically useful for software developers.


Challenges
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Furthermore, we seek contributions on successful approaches for
  solving hard problems, for example:

  • bias in machine-learning systems
  • digital transformation in difficult settings
  • accessibiltity
  • systems with critical reliability requirements
  • ecologically sustainable software development

  We’re especially interested in experience reports. Other topics are
  also relevant, e.g.:

  • introductory talks on technical background
  • overviews of a given field
  • demos and how-tos


Requirements
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  We accept proposals for presentations of 45 minutes (40 minutes talk +
  5 minutes questions), as well as 90 minute tutorials for beginners.
  The language of presentation should be either English or German.

  Your proposal should include (in your presentation language of
  choice):

  • An abstract of max. 1500 characters.
  • A short bio/cv
  • Contact information (including at least email address)
  • A list of 3-5 concrete ideas of how your work can be applied in a
    developer’s daily life
  • additional material (websites, blogs, slides, videos of past
    presentations, …)
  • Don’t be confused: The system calls a submission event.
