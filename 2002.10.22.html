Hello,

Here is the latest Caml Weekly News, week 15 to 22 October, 2002.

1) <a href="#1">AIFAD-1.0.2</a>
2) <a href="#2">MLdonkey 2.00</a>
3) <a href="#3">Operator overloading</a>

1) AIFAD-1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Markus Mottl announced:

I am pleased to announce the first release of AIFAD (Automated Induction
of Functions over Algebraic Datatypes), a novell kind of machine
learning tool.

You can find the distribution and more information here:

  <a href="http://www.oefai.at/~markus/aifad">http://www.oefai.at/~markus/aifad</a>

AFAID improves decision tree learning by supporting significantly more
complex kinds of data. This allows users to more conveniently describe the
data they want to have learnt, which can improve accuracy and complexity
of resulting models.

2) MLdonkey 2.00
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fabrice Le Fessant announced:

   MLdonkey 2.00 has been released. MLdonkey is a peer-to-peer  
file-sharing client completely written in Objective-Caml, that can be
used to access the eDonkey2000, Overnet, Gnutella, Direct Client and
Soulseek networks. It supports downloads from multiple sources and
corruption detection, complex search requests, chat with friends,
internationalization, history of search results, etc...

  MLdonkey is a (non-root) daemon, that can be run under Linux, Mac OS
X and other Unix flavors with Objective-Caml support. The daemon can
be controled through a command-line interface (via telnet), a WEB
interface or a GTK GUI (using lablgtk).

  As I have to move from INRIA, development on MLdonkey will slow down
next month. If some Ocaml programmers are interested in working on
this project, already used by several thousands of users, they are
welcome to join our team, and to contribute to whatever thay want
inside (GUI, network plugins, i18n, ...)

3) Operator overloading
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some hilights of a discussion about operator overloading. The
full thread is at: <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200210/msg00436.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200210/msg00436.html</a>

Chris Hecker said and Shivkumar Chandrasekaran answered:

&gt;The biggest problem with making ocaml look nice and pretty for 
&gt;numerical code is that there is no overloading (of functions or 
&gt;operators),

I have written thousands of lines of numerical linear algebra code in
Clean (where such overloading is possible) and in OCaml. I don't miss
it one bit. (Let me concentrate on matrix multiplication since that was
what the post talked about.)

The reason for not missing overloading is that in coding *efficient*
matrix algorithms, matrix multiplications usually have a well-defined
end-place for the result. This end-place is usually a sub-matrix of an
existing matrix (canonical examples are classical factorizations: LU,
QR). Hence I don't just need "a * b", I really need to say "c = a * b,
but don't generate new space for a * b, just use the space allocated
for c instead".

Luckily in OCaml and Clean we can solve this by making a HOF of type

( |*| ) : matrix * matrix -&gt; (matrix -&gt; unit)

Then I can say (a |*| b) c, or, with one more definition,

c =$ a |*| b

Note, that even Clean will not allow you to replace |*| with *, since
the only way to overload * in Clean is as (matrix matrix -&gt; matrix)
which is not what I want.

Secondly I also need to say, in Matlab notation, a' * b. One cumbersome
way around is to define a function called transpose that just flags its
argument to be transposed without actually doing it. This creates its
own nightmare. A better solution for me (in Clean and OCaml) has been
to define a ~* b to mean a' * b, and variations thereof.

However, for casual coding a la Matlab style, the lack of overloading
could be seen as a problem. Of course one must then be prepared to live
with unnecessary copying and memory accesses.

To which Chris Hecker answered:

Of course, that's why I said "look nice and pretty for numerical code" not
"be efficient".  There are times when you want blas-style functions for
efficiency, and times when you want to write d = (a + b) * (c - b).  Caml
can't do the latter [very cleanly].  That was my point.

Saying the latter isn't necessary or desired is the same type of argument
people use against other high-level language features (gc, etc.).  When
programming, most of my time is spent figuring out what I want to do and
how, it is not spent optimizing (and I write games, which are notoriously
prematurely optimized).  Once I figure something out, then I'll optimize it
if necessary.  Blas-style functions inhibit rapid prototyping and
experimentation, while expression-syntax-style operators inhibit
efficiency.  I want to be able to use both, each at the appropriate time.

That's why I wish Ocaml supported the latter better.

Brian Hurt said:

I'd like to ask a stupid question here: how important is operator
overloading?  Remember, before you answer, that FORTRAN managed to be
crowned king of numerical languages for decades (and may still hold the
crown depending upon who you talk to), with no operator or function
overloading.  You had to call functions with names like cgbmv() (pop quiz-
what does that function do?) and dgesvd().

I'm still an ocaml newbie, so I don't know how ocaml handles operator
overloading.  I do know how C++ handles operator overloading.  Consider
the 'innocent' statement:
    a = b + c + d;
What you want is for the compiler to produce code like:
    a = b;
    a += c;
    a += d;
Instead, what the compiler instead does is:
    t1 = b + c;
    t2 = t1 + d;
    a = t2;
generating two unnessecary temporaries.  If your objects are complex
variables (2 floats) or even short 3D vectors (3 floats) this isn't too
bad.  If your objects are 10,000 element vectors or matricies, creating
two unnecessary temporaries (or even 1 unnecessary temporary) is bad.

So why not just code it as:
    a = b;
    a += c;
    a += d;
?  Well, I ask- is that code all that much more understandable then:

    matrix.assign a b ;
    matrix.addto a c;
    matrix.addto a d;
?  The advantage of operator overloading is the ability to express complex
equations "obviously"-
    a = b + c + d;
is way more understandable than the two examples above or:
    matrix.assign a (matrix.add (matrix.add b c) d)
which is the equivelent.  But if you can't optimize it, you're just asking
to produce bad code.

The other cent I'd like to throw into this discussion is a pointer at the
OoLaLa project- which is attempting to build a whole new linear algebra
library in Java with an OO design (instead of the thin wrappers around
FORTRAN-era BLAS libraries and various operator overloading proposals):
<a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/luj00oolala.html">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/luj00oolala.html</a>
Yes, I know this isn't a functional design.  But I'm throwing it out there
as a springboard for ideas.

Chris Hecker answered the initial question:

&gt;how important is operator overloading?

I'm amazed that people who are interested in high level languages are
asking these questions (not to attack you personally, just the overall
attitude)!

I replied to most of this issue in my previous post, but come on people,
the job of a language is to make the programmer's life easier.  Software
quality is horrible, for the most part, and we don't even get this horrible
software on time.  Why?  Hint:  it's not because correct programs are
running too slow and developers are spending that time optimizing.  It's
because complex software is hard to write correctly.  The language should
help with this.  Ocaml helps in a lot of ways with this problem, but when
writing numerical code it doesn't help very much, or as much as it
could.  That is what I'm complaining about.

If I could write matlab-style syntax in ocaml, hundreds of lines of code in
my game would just disappear.  That would be wonderful!  It would mean it
was easier and faster to write, to debug, and that when I realize I didn't
actually want to do a certain operation, I could change it quickly.  When I
finally figure out what I want to do and how I want to do it, I'll optimize
it.

And besides, the entire idea behind a garbage collector is that it's fast
at handling tons of small allocations!  I use tons of matrix -&gt; matrix -&gt;
matrix operations (like add, mult, etc. in and attempt to make more
readable code) and the performance is perfectly acceptable for
development.  I will optimize things later, but LATER, and only if I need to.

and the debate went on ... <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200210/msg00442.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200210/msg00442.html</a>
