      <cwn_title>PSA: ocaml/opam2 docker images updated to 4.08.0 release</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/psa-ocaml-opam2-docker-images-updated-to-4-08-0-release/3948/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Anil Madhavapeddy announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
The Docker images hosted at [ocaml/opam2](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam2) have now been updated to include the latest OCaml 4.08.0 release as well as the snapshots of 4.09 and 4.10.

One sideeffect of this is that the ~ocaml/opam2~ default image now has OCaml 4.08 as its default switch.  If you use it in CI, it may suddenly give you errors if your code has not yet been ported to work with that new release.

As a reminder, you can pin the OCaml version you use in CI easily by:

- running ~opam switch 4.07~ as the first command in the Dockerfile after ~FROM ocaml/opam2~.
- using the ~ocaml/opam2:4.07~ image instead of the default one.  This image also includes several other 4.07.0 variants (such as afl, flambda and so on), which you can list with ~docker run ocaml/opam2:4.07 opam switch~.

As always, please get in touch with me if you see any other breakage from these image updates.

      <cwn_title>Default key bindings for utop</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/default-key-bindings-for-utop/3950/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Daniel Lim asked</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Just getting into OCaml, and utop is really nice, but I can't seem to find any of the default key bindings listed anywhere online.

It took quite some time to find out ~C-p~ can be used to move to the previous lines, which was really needed when coming across multiline use cases like this:

#+begin_src ocaml
let ratio x y =
  Float.of_int x /. Float.of_int y
;;
#+end_src

Is there anywhere that I can find the default key bindings for the repl?

You can use ~#utop_bindings;;~ command in the prompt. Check out other useful ~#utop_*~ commands as well.

You can also override these in ~~/.lambda-term-inputrc~. Here's what I have:

#+begin_example
$ cat ~/.lambda-term-inputrc
[read-line]
C-p: complete-bar-prev
C-n: complete-bar-next
#+end_example

I overrode these to use Ctrl (~C~) instead of Meta (~M~) because with my setup (Mac Terminal.app) the meta character (which I would expect to be mapped to the Command key) doesn't seem to work.

Everyone knows there is a [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). And Rust is [working](https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/07/27/rust-platform/) with a similar concepts for a few years already. Maybe it makes sense to start working towards this goal in OCamlverse as well? The relevant thing is [Duniverse](https://github.com/avsm/duniverse) by @avsm, but the platform concept should go further, helping to download the bundle at once, instead of installing hundreds of packages manually. I see there is actually a [site page](http://ocaml.org/platform/) for the OCaml Platform, but it is basically empty.

It even makes sense to include Visual Studio Code with OCaml plugins installed.
