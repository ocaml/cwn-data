* First release of Feat
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-feat/7033/1

** François Pottier announced


A brief note to announce the first release of Feat:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam install feat
#+end_example

Feat is a library that offers support for counting, enumerating, and sampling
objects of a certain kind, such as (say) the inhabitants of an algebraic data
type.

Feat was inspired by the paper "Feat: Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types"
by Jonas Duregård, Patrik Jansson and Meng Wang (2012).

More details can be found here:

* OCluster and OBuilder
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 2
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocluster-and-obuilder/7035/1

** Thomas Leonard announced


I'm pleased to announce the first release of [[https://github.com/ocurrent/ocluster][OCluster]]. A user
can submit a build job (either a Dockerfile or an OBuilder spec) to the scheduler, which then runs the
build on a worker machine, streaming the logs back to the client.

This is the build scheduler / cluster manager that we use for e.g.
[[https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci][opam-repo-ci]] (which you may have seen in action if you
submitted a package to opam-repository recently).

See [[https://github.com/ocurrent/overview][ocurrent/overview]] for a quick overview of the various other
CI services using it too.

To install and run the scheduler use e.g.

#+begin_src shell
opam depext -i ocluster
mkdir capnp-secrets
ocluster-scheduler \
  --capnp-secret-key-file=./capnp-secrets/key.pem \
  --capnp-listen-address=tcp:0.0.0.0:9000 \
  --capnp-public-address=tcp:127.0.0.1:9000 \
  --state-dir=/var/lib/ocluster-scheduler \
  --pools=linux-arm32,linux-x86_64
#+end_src

It will generate ~key.pem~ on the first run, as well as various capability files granting access for
workers and clients. You then copy each generated pool capability (e.g. ~pool-linux-x86_64.cap~) to
each machine you want in that pool, and run ~ocluster-worker pool-linux-x86_64.cap~ to start the worker
agent. See the [[https://github.com/ocurrent/ocluster/blob/master/README.md][README]] for full details.

[[https://github.com/ocurrent/obuilder][OBuilder]] is an alternative to ~docker build~. The main
differences are that it takes a spec in S-expression format, which is easier to generate than a
Dockerfile, handles concurrent builds reliably, and keeps copies of the logs so that you still see the
output even if someone else performed the same build step earlier and the result is therefore taken
from the cache.

It currently supports ZFS and Btrfs for storage (it needs cheap snapshots) and ~runc~ for sandboxing
builds. [[https://github.com/ocurrent/obuilder/issues/57][macos support]] is under development, but not
yet upstreamed. It should be fairly easy to add support for any platform that has some form of secure
chroot.

OCluster supports monitoring with Prometheus, so you can see what the cluster is doing:

* Plotting 3D vectors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/plotting-3d-vectors/7038/1

** Andreas Poisel asked


I'm doing linear algebra with Owl.  Owl-plplot works great for visualizing 2D vectors, but it doesn't
seem to capable of plotting 3D vectors.

I took a (fast) look at vanilla [[http://plplot.org/][Plplot]],
[[https://github.com/sanette/oplot][Oplot]], and the [[https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-gnuplot][GNUplot
bindings]], but I didn't find a simple way to plot 3D vectors.

I don't need high quality plots, 3D surfaces, a lot of control or fancy features, just a coordinate
system and some function to draw geometric primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).

Did I miss anything or do I have to build this myself with the good old Graphics module?
      

** Marshall Abrams replied


What kind of vector representation do you want?  Just lines/arrows in 3D?  That's just a curve in 3D,
so it should be possible with Owl and plplot, at least.  Looks like it should be easy with oplot, too
(but I haven't used oplot).  There are some 3D Owl plplot examples, with source code, on these pages:

https://ocaml.xyz/book/visualisation.html

https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/wiki/Tutorial:-How-to-Plot-in-Owl%3F

https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/wiki/Plot-Gallery

I don't know whether it will be easy to adapt them to your needs.  I wrote the last example on the last
page above.  It's a plot of a series 2D curves in 3D.  Maybe some of the techniques can be adapted to
your needs.  (The code is a few years old.  I'm not sure whether it works with the current version of
Owl.)

(If you end up having to use low-level bindings to plplot, oplot, etc. from Owl, you might consider
contributing a wrapper module that makes it easy to do the kind of plot you want.)
      

** Andreas Poisel then said


Thank you for your answer.

I'd just like to draw 3D vectors in a cartesian coordinate system.  A plot should look similar to this:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/3D_Vector.svg/800px-3D_Vector.svg.png

I wouldn't even need arrows, simple lines would be ok.

Maybe there is a way to use one of the 3D functions (~Plot.surf~, ~Plot.mesh~, ~Plot.contour~), but I
can't figure it out.
      

** Hezekiah Carty replied


It's been a while since I worked with plplot but what you showed should be possible. The
[[http://plplot.org/docbook-manual/plplot-html-5.15.0/plline3.html][plline3]] function allows you to plot
line segments in 3d space. The function is setup to take multiple segments in a single call. For a
single segment each array would hold a single value. Colors can be set between draw calls.
      

** sanette also replied


in oplot, there is the Curve3d object that should do it,
https://sanette.github.io/oplot/oplot/Oplot/Plt/index.html#type-plot_object.Curve3d
although it is quite rudimentary
      



* Marshal determinism and stability

** Deep in this thread, Bikal Lem mentioned and Raphaël Proust described


#+begin_quote
[[https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/data-encoding][Binary module of data-encoding]]
#+end_quote

Quick notes about this approach:

- It is used extensively in the Tezos codebase. For data exchange (in the p2p layer), for data at rest (configuration files), and for a mix of the two (serialisation of economic protocol data which is both exchanged by peers and stored on disk).
- It is flexible in that you have great control over the representation of data and the serialisation/deserialisation procedure. There is a medium-term plan to allow even more control. For now you can decide, say, if 8 booleans are represented as one byte, 8 bytes, or 8 words (or something else altogether) (see code below).
- Some of the responsibility for correctness rests upon your shoulders as a user. E.g., when you encode a tuple, the left element must have either a fixed length (e.g., be an int8, int32, etc., be a fixed-length string, or be a tuple of fixed-length values) or be prefixed by a length marker (which the library provides a combinator for). Most of the errors for this are raised when you declare the encoding and a few are raised when you use the encoding. I recommend writing some tests to check that your encodings accept the range of values that you are going to throw at them.
- The library is well tested: there are tests using crowbar to check that encoding and decoding are actual inverse of each others.

Let me know if you have more questions. And in the meantime, here's two different encodings for a tuple
of 8 booleans:

#+begin_src ocaml
(* easy-encoding, produces 8 bytes *)
let boolsas8bytes =
   tup8 bool bool bool bool bool bool bool bool

(* very-compact encoding, produces 1 byte *)
let boolsas1byte =
   conv
      (fun (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8) ->
         let acc = 0 in
         let acc = if b1 then acc lor 0b10000000 else acc in
         let acc = if b2 then acc lor 0b01000000 else acc in
         let acc = if b3 then acc lor 0b00100000 else acc in
         …
         acc)
      (fun i ->
         let b1 = i land 0b10000000 <> 0 in
         let b1 = i land 0b01000000 <> 0 in
         let b1 = i land 0b00100000 <> 0 in
         …
         (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8))
      uint8
#+end_src

In general, data-encoding is probably slower than marshal, but its strong points are:
- it offers some type guarantees,
- it gives you some control over the representation of the data,
- it allows you to define representations that are easy to parse in other languages or in other versions of the same language,
- it generates documentation about the data-representation.

** gasche announced


The recent URL https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/#activity%3Dexercises
contains auto-graded OCaml exercises, in particular a bunch of advanced and fairly interesting
exercices written by François Pottier, which I would recommend for anyone knowledgeable in OCaml and
curious about algorithms and functional programming. (You have to scroll down to see those, the
exercises at the top come from the OCaml MOOC.)

See for example François' exercises on:
- [[https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/exercise.html#id%3Dfpottier/alpha_beta%26tab%3Dtext%26prelude%3Dshown][Alpha-Beta Search]],
- [[https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/exercise.html#id%3Dfpottier/parser_combinators%26tab%3Dtext][Parser combinators]],
- [[https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/exercise.html#id%3Dfpottier/huffman%26tab%3Dtext%26prelude%3Dshown][Huffman Compression]],
- [[https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/exercise.html#id%3Dfpottier/nondet_monad_cont%26tab%3Dtext%26prelude%3Dshown][Implementing backtracking with continuations]], or
- my personal favorite, [[https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/exercise.html#id%3Dfpottier/pprint%26tab%3Dtext%26prelude%3Dshown][reimplementing the core of a pretty-printer]].

Context: the exercise platform is [[https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml][LearnOCaml]], initially
written by OCamlPro for the OCaml MOOC and maintaing by Yann Régis-Gianas (@yurug) on behalf of the
[[http://ocaml-sf.org/][OCaml Software Foundation]]. We (at the Foundation) are trying to assemble a
corpus of nice OCaml exercises for teachers and people self-studying, and the nice exercises by
François Pottier (@fpottier) were written as part of this initiative.
