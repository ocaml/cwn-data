                     Preliminary Call for Papers

                 The 2005 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                <a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/ml05/">http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/ml05/</a>

               To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2005
                          September 29, 2005
                           Tallinn, Estonia

The ML family of programming languages, whose dialects include
Standard ML, Objective Caml, Alice ML and nML, has inspired a
tremendous amount of language research, ranging from type inference
to module systems to operational semantics and implementation.
Languages from the ML family have alse been successfully applied in
areas ranging from compilers and theorem provers to low-level system
software, web applications and video games.

The goal of the Workshop is to provide a forum for researchers,
developers, and users to hear about and discuss the latest work on the
use, design, and implementation of ML-like languages.  Previous ML
Workshops have been held in Edinburgh, Pittsburgh, San Francisco,
Orlando and Baltimore.

The 2005 Workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in Tallinn,
Estonia. We seek papers on any ML-related topic, including (but not
limited to):

* applications
* extensions: objects, classes, concurrency, distribution and mobility, 
    semi-structured data handling, etc.
* type systems: inference, modules, specification, error reporting, etc.
* implementation: compilers, interpreters, partial evaluators,
    garbage collectors, etc.
* environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, 
    cross-language interoperability, etc.
* semantics

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results, or
informed positions regarding proposals for next-generation ML languages.
In order to encourage lively discussion, submitted papers may describe
work in progress.  Proceedings will be published as a volume of
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).

Announcement and Call for Papers for the 17th International Workshop
on the Implementation and Application of Functional Languages (IFL'05)

September 19th-21st, 2005, Dublin, Ireland.
Website: <a href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/ifl05">http://www.cs.tcd.ie/ifl05</a>
E-mail: ifl05@cs.tcd.ie

== Scope and Topics ==

The IFL workshops form a tradition that has lasted for nearly two
decades. The aim of these workshops is to bring together
researchers actively engaged in the implementation and application
of functional and function-based programming languages. They
provide an open forum for researchers who wish to present and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, preliminary
results, etc. related primarily but not exclusively to the
implementation and application of functional languages.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to
  * language concepts
  * type checking
  * compilation techniques
  * generic programming techniques
  * (abstract) interpretation
  * automatic program generation
  * (abstract) machine architectures
  * formal aspects
  * array processing
  * concurrent/parallel programming
  * concurrent/parallel program execution
  * heap management
  * runtime profiling
  * performance measurements
  * debugging and tracing
  * verification
  * tools and programming techniques

Papers on applications demonstrating the suitability of
novel ideas in any of the above areas and contributions on related
theoretical work are also welcomed. The change of the workshop name
adding the term "application", introduced in 2004, is to reflect the
broader scope IFL has gained over recent years.

== Contributions ==

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the draft proceedings (published as a technical report of the
Department of Computer Science of the University of Dublin) and to give
presentations at the workshop. All contributions must be written in
English, conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format, and not
exceed 16 pages.

&gt; Pervasives.compare currently returns an int. Intuitively it would be 
&gt; more appropriate for it to return a union type such as the following.
&gt; type comparison_result = Less | Equals | Greater
&gt; What are the reasons behind the present design choice?

It's a historical error.  If I were to do it again, I'd use a sum type
such as your "comparison_result".  The current solution allows to use
(-) (integer subtraction) as the comparison predicate for *small*
integer arguments, but this doesn't work as a general integer
comparison because of subtraction wrapping around for large arguments.
So, there are really no benefits to encode the result of a 3-way
comparison as an "int".
    </pre><i>The thread having moved off-topic, Jon Harrop asked and Jacques Carette answered:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Would someone be so kind as to enlighten me (and probably a few other people!) 
&gt; as to what these intruiging GADT things are and what they're good for? :-)

They are a (conservative) extension to Algebraic Data Types (and G=Guarded or
Generalized, depending on the author).  The basic idea is that instead of
giving names to the various constructors in a Sum type, you give explicit
functions which become the constructors.  Furthermore, you then make type
inference context-dependent: the type of each constructor is inferred
independently, and can have different 'guards'.  

Or at least that's my quick-and-dirty impression, which definitely contains
technical inaccuracies, but is roughly right.  To get a good introduction, why
not turn to 
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/slides/slides-msr-11-2004.pdf">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/slides/slides-msr-11-2004.pdf</a>

The most convincing example I have seen is that an eval function for a
statically-typed language
let rec eval e = 
   match e with 
     | Lit n -&gt; n
     | Plus(a,b) -&gt; (eval a) + (eval b)
     | True -&gt; true
     | False -&gt; false
     | And(a,b) -&gt; (eval a) &amp;&amp; (eval b)
     | If(t,c,a) -&gt; if eval t then eval c else eval a
     | IfZero e' -&gt; (eval e') = 0
is currently rejected in ML languages, but with GADTs the above can be
accepted, as it can't "go wrong".

for a very readable description that doesn't rely on heavy type theory to get
the idea across.

I wonder, if you really want to use this approach for genericity on, say
numeric types, if you need something like Haskell's newtype (and a guarantee
that the constructor get optimized away) to make it useful?

&gt; Er.. Excuse me for sticking my nose into this, but I think I read 
&gt; something interesting. Parser combinators? What do you mean? I'm quite 
&gt; sure I have not seen any operators acting on stream parsers, at least if 
&gt; by stream parsers you mean the LL1 based on pa_op.cmo camlp4 module.

The point is that you can define them yourself.
For instance here is the star operator.

let rec star ?(acc=[]) p = parser
    [&lt; x = p ; s &gt;] -&gt; star ~acc:(x::acc) p s
  | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; List.rev acc

More concretely, here is another version of expression parsing, using
functionals. 

type expr =
    Num of int
  | Var of string
  | Plus of expr * expr
  | Mult of expr * expr

open Genlex

let rec accumulate parse accu = parser
  | [&lt; e = parse accu; s &gt;] -&gt; accumulate parse e s
  | [&lt; &gt;] -&gt; accu
(* val accumulate : ('a -&gt; Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; 'a) -&gt;
                    'a -&gt; Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; 'a *)
let left_assoc parse op wrap =
  let parse' accu =
    parser [&lt; 'Kwd k when k = op; s &gt;] -&gt; wrap accu (parse s) in
  parser [&lt; e1 = parse; e2 = accumulate parse' e1 &gt;] -&gt; e2
(* val left_assoc : (Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; 'a) -&gt;
       string -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; 'a *)
let rec parse_simple = parser
  | [&lt; 'Int n &gt;] -&gt; Num n
  | [&lt; 'Ident x &gt;] -&gt; Var x
  | [&lt; 'Kwd"("; e = parse_expr; 'Kwd")" &gt;] -&gt; e
and parse_mult s =
  left_assoc parse_simple "*" (fun e1 e2 -&gt; Mult(e1,e2)) s
and parse_expr s =
  left_assoc parse_mult "+" (fun e1 e2 -&gt; Plus(e1,e2)) s
(* val parse_simple : Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; expr
   val parse_mult : Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; expr
   val parse_expr : Genlex.token Stream.t -&gt; expr *)

let lexer = Genlex.make_lexer ["+";"*";"(";")"]
let parse_string s =
  match lexer (Stream.of_string s) with parser
    [&lt; e = parse_expr; _ = Stream.empty &gt;] -&gt; e
(* val parse_string : string -&gt; expr *)

I leave as exercise how to extend it to handle "-" and "/" in a
generic way.

Is there any easy way to _correctly_ do a "select" (as in the UNIX
system call) on Pervasives.in_channel?  My naive approach

  Unix.select [Unix.descr_of_in_channel ic] [] [] 0.

seems to fail (and it indeed does fail) because of the buffering
inside Pervasives.in_channel, as long as I checked the source code of
ocaml-3.08.3.  Pervasives.in_channel_length doesn't help in my case
since the input channel is not a file.  Should I use only the
low-level functions in the Unix module if I _ever_ want "select"?
    </pre><i>Gerd Stolpmann answered and Eijiro Sumii replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Yes. The point is that you cannot interpret the result of Unix.select in
&gt; a reasonable manner. When Unix.select says the descriptor has no data,
&gt; it might still the case that there are data in the buffer.

Yes, this is what I thought.

&gt; If the descriptor has data, you don't know when they are exactly
&gt; read into the buffer.

Here I don't quite understand what you mean - does this issue per se
prevent us from polling an in_channel?

&gt; I don't understand why you mention in_channel_length here.

If the channel were a (binary) file, I could use in_channel_length to
know how many bytes I should read (by Pervasives.really_input, for
example).

&gt; What is your real problem?

In my program, I need to wait _only for 60 seconds_ for data from a
channel created by Unix.open_connection.  For this purpose, something
like Unix.select would be the best if it worked.

Assuming that no such function like Unix.select exists for
Pervasives.in_channel, I've written the following ad hoc external
function, which can be used (in combination with Unix.select) to
achieve similar effects.  Of course, it might be unsafe if the channel
structure is different in other versions of OCaml.  Any better idea,
anyone...?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;caml/mlvalues.h&gt;

  char * end; char * curr; char * max;
  void * mutex; struct channel * next;
  int revealed; int old_revealed; int refcount;
  char buff[0];
};
#define Channel(v) (*((struct channel **) (Data_custom_val(v))))

value in_channel_is_empty(value vc) {
  struct channel *c = Channel(vc);
  return Val_int((c-&gt;curr &gt;= c-&gt;max) ? 1 : 0);
}

would be even nicer.

I have not been following this thread closely, so I did not answer earlier. My
impression is that select and buffered IO are concepts that do not live well
together. I This is probably the reason the Caml team has for not implementing
such a feature in the Pervasives channels API.

I would attempt to model the problem in a multithreaded paradigm, where the the
"selecting" is implicit in the thread scheduling mechanism. Of course, if you
allow the use of threads, the selecting on channels becomes fairly trivial.

let (++) x f = f x

let input_string =
  let buf =  String.create 1024 in
    fun ic -&gt;
      let bytes = input ic buf 0 1024 in
        String.sub buf 0 bytes

module IO_manager = struct
  type tio_manager = string Event.channel
  let wrap_in_channel (evch : io_manager) (ic : input_channel)=
    let rec cycle () =
      ic ++ input_string ++ Event.send ++ Event.sync;
      cycle ()
    in Thread.create cycle ()
end

Of course, this is a very rough sketch of message_passing API based on the
Event module, encapsulating the select facility on top of an input_channel.
Actually, ic could be any resource the program might need to synchronize on.

Let me add that Baretta DE&amp;IT is using this paradigm to multiplex IO from/to
different field buses in its Ocaml based, SoftPLC / SoftCNC kernel.

I'm not sure of what you want, but does this do the job?
let système command f_line = 
  let cin = Unix.open_process_in command
  in 
    (try while true do
      f_line (input_line cin);
    done with | End_of_file -&gt; ());
  Unix.close_process_in cin
;;
It is just a function that give to 'f_line' evry 
lines produced by a pipe by the 'command'.

I use it for Xdialog2Ocaml
