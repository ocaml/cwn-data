      <cwn_title>What should the "size" in "caml_alloc_custom" be?</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/86614b3421bab408#</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Lyn Hong asked and Goswin von Brederlow replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; I have a question about "allocating custom blocks" in "iterfacing C with object
&gt; Ocaml". when we call function "caml_alloc_custom(ops, size, used, max)" in the
&gt; C side, if the structure we want to allocate has a pointer, is the "size" 
&gt; going to be size of the structure itself only, or should we also include the
&gt; memory block that pointer points to?

The size is the number of ocaml words in the structure itself. The
pointer then points outside the ocaml heap to some C memory allocated by
malloc(). You should account for that size in the used/max pair.
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Lyn Hong then asked and Goswin von Brederlow replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; Thank you so much for the reply.
&gt; So when we free the memory, what do we do with the block that pointer points
&gt; to? Free it in the 'finalization function' associated to 'ops'?

That depends on who allocted the memory and who is supposed to free
it.

In some cases a library will free the chunk when some cleanup function
is called and your binding for cleanup() should then invalidate the
pointer and other bindings should verify the pointer is still valid
before using it. In that case the 'finalization function' can either
call cleanup() when the pointer is still valid when ocaml declares the
block as unused, give a warning that cleanup() wasn't called and call it
or even give an error. I like the warning best.

In other cases the chunk is something you are supposed to free when you
are done with it. Then you just free() it.

I really depends on the situation. Make damn sure that neigther the
ocaml nor C code accesses the chunk after it has been freed, ever.
Also make sure it doesn't get leaked.

      <cwn_title>Problem with recursive class and non-class types</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/5ade4e58eef72cbb#</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Goswin von Brederlow asked and Jacques Garrigue replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; I want to define the two types below:
&gt; 
&gt; type foo = { bar : bar; }
&gt; class bar = object val mutable foo : foo list = [] end
&gt; 
&gt; Is there another way of doing this other than:
&gt; 
&gt; # type 'a foo = { bar : 'a; } 
&gt;   class bar = object val mutable foo : #bar foo list = [] end;;
&gt; type 'a foo = { bar : 'a; }
&gt; class bar : object val mutable foo : #bar foo list end

The alternative is to use a recursive module, but this is actually
more verbose.

module rec M : sig
  type foo = { bar : M.bar; }
  class bar : object val mutable foo : foo list end
end = struct
  type foo = { bar : M.bar; }
  class bar =  object val mutable foo : foo list = [] end
end

You can avoid a bit of the verboseness by splitting types and values,
since recursive modules built only from types require no duplication.

module rec M : sig
  type foo = { bar : M.bar; }
  class type bar = object val mutable foo : foo list end
end = M

class bar : M.bar = object val mutable foo : M.foo list = [] end

You still need to provide an explicit interface for bar.

      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Goswin von Brederlow suggested</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Some comments:

- For things you don't want to be deleted even though make sees they
will never be reused on subsequent make calls look up .PRECIOUS

- Targets that have no dependencies and create no file are implicitly
PHONY. No need to specify it as such. A reason for why one might do it
anyway would be to protect against someone doing "touch clean" by
accident:

% touch clean
% make clean
make: `clean' is up to date.

A .PHONY: clean would prevent that and run clean anyway.

- Don't create interface files if there are none

If you start writing a module and haven't decided on the exact interface
it will be a pain to delete the generated interface file every time. It
is also completly useless as you can generate the cmi file from the .ml
file directly. No need to create .mli first.

- Use ocamldep

Ocamldep figures out wich modules depend on other modules and generates
that in Makefile syntax for you. Unfortunately ocamldep lacks an option
to generate a dependency line for the final binary so SOURCES below must
be set by hand and in the right order.

- List source files, not generated files and use pattern substitution to
get the later


Here is my own version of a Makefile for a trivial project. I hardcoded
it for native code but you already know how to use 'TARGET=byte' from
your Makefile. Merging the two is left as an execise.

PROG       := prog
LIBS       := graphics unix
SOURCES    := foo.ml bar.ml baz.ml

# No user servicable parts below
INTERFACES := $(wildcard *.mli)
OBJS       := $(patsubst %.ml,%.cmx,$(SOURCES))
LIBS       := $(patsubst %,%.cmxa,$(LIBS))

# Count number of cores and use them all, no idea how do to that for windows
PARALLEL   := -j$(shell cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l)

all:
	$(MAKE) $(PARALLEL) $(PROG)

$(PROG): $(OBJS)
       ocamlopt -o $@ $(LIBS) $(OBJS)

clean:
       rm -rf $(PROG) *.o *.cmx *.cmi *~

%.cmx: %.ml
       ocamlopt -c $*.ml

%.cmi: %.mli
       ocamlopt -c $*.mli

.depend: $(SOURCES) $(INTERFACES)
       ocamldep -native $(SOURCES) $(INTERFACES) &gt;.depend

      <cwn_title>Jane Street is hiring</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/ea39a900de79434e#</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Yaron Minsky announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I would like to announce that Jane Street, a proprietary trading
company with offices in New York, London and (soon) Hong Kong is
actively looking to hire talented functional programmers.

We're looking for people who have a deep interest in and understanding
of software and technology.  We're not looking for experience with
financial markets --- that's something we believe we can teach people
on the job.

Jane Street is deeply committed to functional programming, having the
largest team of OCaml programmers in any industrial setting, and
probably the world's largest OCaml codebase.  We use OCaml for running
our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems
administration to trading systems.  If you're interested in seeing how
functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better
place than here.

The atmosphere is informal and intellectual.  There is a focus on
education, and people get a chance to learn both about software and
about trading.  The work is challenging, and you get to see the
practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms.  Jane
Street is also a small enough place that people have the freedom to
get involved in many different areas of the business.  Compensation is
highly competitive, with a great deal of room for growth.

If you'd like to learn more, here are some links.  You can get an
overview of the firm from our website:

  http://janestreet.com

There's a talk I gave at CMU a while back that gives a good overview
of what Jane Street does and why we use OCaml:

  http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61

We also have an OCaml blog:

 http://ocaml.janestreet.com

There are also a couple of papers we've written about our experiences
here using functional languages.

If you're interested, send me a resume and cover letter.

      <cwn_title>Workshop on ML 2010 - Call for Content</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/30439dc60e62c7dd#</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Matthew Fluet announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
                The 2010 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML
                 http://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/ml2010
                 Baltimore, Maryland, United States
                     Sunday, September 26, 2010
                     co-located with ICFP 2010

                          Call for Content

ML is a family of programming languages that includes dialects known
as Standard ML, Objective Caml, and F#. The development of these
languages has inspired a large amount of computer science research,
both practical and theoretical. This workshop aims to provide a forum
to encourage discussion and research on ML and related technology
(higher-order, typed, or strict languages).

The format of the 2010 Workshop on ML will be different than that of
recent years, returning to a more informal model: a workshop with
presentations selected from submitted abstracts but without published
proceedings. We hope that this format will encourage the presentation
of more exciting (if unpolished) research and deliver a more lively
workshop atmosphere.


Invited Speaker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Luke Hoban (Microsoft) -- Bringing F# to Visual Studio 2010


Important Dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submission:	25 June, 2010
Notification:	9 August, 2010


Format
~~~~~~

The workshop will consist of presentations by the participants,
selected from submitted abstracts. Participants are invited to submit
working drafts, source code, and/or extended abstracts for
distribution on the workshop homepage and to the attendees, but as the
workshop will have no formal proceedings, any contributions may be
submitted for publication to other venues. (See the SIGPLAN
republication policy for more details.)


Scope
~~~~~

We primarily seek research presentations on topics related to ML,
including (but not limited to):
* applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.
* extensions: higher forms of polymorphism, generic programming,
  objects, concurrency, distribution and mobility, semi-structured
  data handling, etc.
* type systems: inference, effects, overloading, modules, contracts,
  specifications and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting,
  etc.
* implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial
  evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, etc.
* environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language
  interoperability, functional data structures, etc.
* semantics: operational, denotational, program equivalence,
  parametricity, mechanization, etc.

Research presentations should describe new ideas, experimental
results, significant advances in ML-related projects, or informed
positions regarding proposals for next-generation ML-style
languages. We especially encourage presentations that describe work in
progress, that outline a future research agenda, or that encourage
lively discussion.

In addition to research presentations, we seek both Status Reports and
Demos that emphasize the practical application of ML research and
technology.

Status Reports: Status reports are intended as a way of informing
others in the ML community about the status of ML-related research or
implementation projects, as well as communicating insights gained from
such projects. Status reports need not present original research, but
should deliver new information. In the abstract submission, describe
the project and the specific technical content to be presented.

Demos: Live demonstrations or tutorials are intended to show new
developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the form
of tools, libraries, or application software built on or related to ML
technology. In the abstract submission (which need only be about half
a page), describe the demo and its technical content, and be sure to
include the demo's title, authors, collaborators, references, and
acknowledgments. A demonstration should take 10-15 minutes. The exact
time per demo will be decided based on the number of accepted
submissions. (Please note that you will need to provide all the
hardware and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers
are only able provide a projector.)


Submission Guidelines and Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email submissions to mtf AT cs.rit.edu. Submissions should be at most
two pages, in PDF format, and printable on US Letter or A4 sized
paper. Persons for whom this poses a hardship should contact the
program chair. Submissions longer than a half a page should include a
paragraph synopsis suitable for inclusion in the workshop program.

      <cwn_what>
In case you're interested in more sophisticated examples of the DSL + 
phantom types combination, I've worked on [Macaque] wich is a SQL DSL 
for Caml using essentially the same technique. We were able to encode 
useful properties of the SQL values, such as nullability, in the OCaml 
type system. 
The translation from the DSL to the caml code is not always direct, 
because in some case you want to generate elaborate source terms wich 
use the type system to enforce static guarantees (eg. correcteness of 
the GROUP BY clauses).
