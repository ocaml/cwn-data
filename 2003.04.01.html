1) New PXP mailing list
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Blair Zajac announced:

I've set up a new Mailman mailing list for Ocaml's PXP, the Polymorphic
XML Parser.  This list has Gerd's backing.

The intention of this list is to be a place to discuss using and
improving PXP, reporting bugs, and the other things you would expect
from a mailing list for PXP.

The mailing list is managed with Mailman 2.1.1.  It's home page is

    <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/mailman/listinfo/ocaml-pxp-users">http://www.orcaware.com/mailman/listinfo/ocaml-pxp-users</a>

and the email address of the list is

    ocaml-pxp-users@orcaware.com

You can subscribe by going to

    <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/mailman/listinfo/ocaml-pxp-users">http://www.orcaware.com/mailman/listinfo/ocaml-pxp-users</a>

2) Recursive types and functors
----------------------------------------------------------------------
David Brown asked and Jean-Christophe Filliatre discussed:
(the message contains some code, available at
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200303/msg00352.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200303/msg00352.html</a>)

&gt; I have a recursive type where I'd like one of the constructors of the
&gt; type to contain a set of the type (or something like set).  However, I
&gt; can't figure out how to represent this.
&gt; 
&gt; For example:
&gt; 
&gt; type foo =
&gt;   | Integer of int
&gt;   | String of string
&gt;   | Set of FooSet
&gt; 
&gt; module FooSet = Set.Make (struct type t = foo let compare = compare end)
&gt; 
&gt; but this obviously doesn't work.

I'm pretty  sure this has already  been discussed on this  list, but I
couldn't find the related thread in the archives...

A (too) naive solution could be  to make a polymorphic instance of the
Set module (either  by adding an argument 'a  everywhere in signatures
OrderedType  and S,  or  by  copying the  functor  body and  replacing
Ord.compare by compare); then you have polymorphic sets, say 'a Set.t,
balanced using compare, and you can define

        type foo = Integer of int | ... | Set of foo Set.t

Unfortunately this  doesn't work because sets  themselves shouldn't be
compared with  compare, but with  Set.compare (see set.mli).  And then
you  point out  the  main  difficulty: comparing  values  in type  foo
requires  to  be able  to  compare sets  of  foo,  and comparing  sets
requires to *implement* sets and thus to compare values in foo.

Fortunately, there  is another solution  (though a bit  more complex).
First  we  define  a  more  generic  type 'a  foo  where  'a  will  be
substituted later by sets of foo:

        type 'a foo = Integer of int | ... | Set of 'a

Then we implement a variant  of module Set which implements sets given
the following signature:

        module type OrderedType =
        sig
          type 'a t
          val compare: ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int) -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'a t -&gt; int
        end

that is where elements are in  the polymorphic type 'a t and where the
comparison function depends on  a comparison function for arguments in
'a (which will represent the  sets, in fine). The functor implements a
type t for  sets using balanced trees, as usual,  and defines the type
of elements elt to be t Ord.t:

        module Make(Ord: OrderedType) =
          struct
            type elt = t Ord.t
            and t = Empty | Node of t * elt * t * int

Right  after, it  implements comparison  over elements  and sets  in a
mutually recursive way:

        let rec compare_elt x y =
          Ord.compare compare x y

        and compare = ... (usual comparison of sets, using compare_elt)

The remaining  of the  functor is  exactly the same  as for  Set, with
compare_elt used  instead of Ord.compare. I  attach the implementation
of this module.

There  is (at  least) another  solution: to  use a  set implementation
where comparison  does not require  a comparison of elements.  This is
possible if, for instance, you are performing hash-consing on type foo
(which result  in tagging foo values  with integers, then  used in the
comparison). This  solution is used in Claude  Marché's regexp library
(<a href="http://www.lri.fr/~marche/regexp/">http://www.lri.fr/~marche/regexp/</a>) and  uses a hash-consing technique
available here: <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html">http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html</a>

3) OCaml performance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
David Monniaux discussed Ocaml performance:

Let me tell you about our experience here. We are developing a large
program consisting of
- a large part of Caml code handling complex data structures
- a smaller C library handling certain numerical matrix computations that
  are triggered by the Caml code 
- some C (+ assembler) libraries dealing with system-dependent issues.

I profiled the code using OProfile (<a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net">http://oprofile.sourceforge.net</a>), for
expenses in clock cycles and cache faults. Earlier attempts were made with
gprof.

It turned out that we spent a significant amount of time in:

- The Caml polymorphic compare function (15% time + some cache faults)

  Part of the problem seems to lie with the fact that the same function is
  called when comparing strings, int64's and other types, thus the
  processor has to do lots of tests and jumps just to get at the correct
  comparison function.

  Wouldn't it be reasonable to define String.compare and Int64.compare to
  call monomorphic functions?

- The garbage collector (15% time + lots of cache faults)

  There's little we can do about it. Changing the size of the minor heap,
  adjusting it to optimize the use of L2 cache seems to gain 2.30% of the
  total running time.

  Curiously, using the compactor seems to slow things slightly.

  Would it be possible to optimize the GC cache-wise? For instance, have
  it ask the processor to "prefetch" data.

- 17% in a particular matrix function written in C. There's little we can
  do except trying to optimize it carefully and compiling it with the best
  C compiler around.

- The rest of the time is spent within the Caml code.

Now this was a bit surprising to us, because we thought we spent far more
time in the numerical computations.

On a related subject, Issac Trotts asked and Xavier Leroy answered:
(start of thread: <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200303/msg00372.html">http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200303/msg00372.html</a>)

&gt; Here's a numerical mini-benchmark comparing C to OCaml
&gt; on a simple implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform:
&gt; 
&gt;   <a href="http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/dft_compare.tar.gz">http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/dft_compare.tar.gz</a>
&gt; 
&gt; The results on my 1 GHZ Pentium III Linux box:
&gt; 
&gt; C:
&gt; real    0m21.273s
&gt; user    0m21.200s
&gt; sys     0m0.040s
&gt; 
&gt; OCaml:
&gt; real    1m51.602s
&gt; user    1m47.020s
&gt; sys     0m0.260s
&gt; 
&gt; So the C version was about five times as fast.  This is after looking 
&gt; for ideas
&gt; in the "Writing Efficient Numerical code in Objective Caml" page [1]
&gt; and the Great Language Shootout statistical moment page for OCaml [2].  
&gt; 
&gt; The OCaml code was easier to read and debug, and would be
&gt; easier to modify.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be interested if anyone on this list knows of a way
&gt; to make it perform as well as the C version (without using the FFT.)

It can be done, but not on a Pentium 3.  Here are my timings:

                      Pentium 4        Pentium 4 SSE2     Alpha 21264   
                      (2 GHz)          (2 GHz)            (500 MHz)

C                       20                20                 36
OCaml (your code)      113                40                 52
OCaml (variant 1)       90                26                 40
OCaml (variant 2)       72                38                100

Variants 1 and 2 differ on the complex multiply step:

Your code:
               let a2=c*. !a -. s*. !b 
               and b2=c*. !b +. s*. !a in
               a := a2; 
               b := b2;
Variant 1:
               let x = s *. !a in
               a := c*. !a -. s*. !b;
               b := c*. !b +. x
Variant 2:
               let olda = !a and oldb = !b in
               a := c *. olda -. s *. oldb;
               b := c *. oldb +. s *. olda


The "Pentium 4 SSE2" column is an experimental code generator for the
Pentium 4 that uses SSE2 instructions and registers for floating-point
computations.  (Before you ask: no, it's not publically available,
but will be the basis for the x86_64 code generator as soon as the
hardware becomes available.)

As you can see above, variant 1 achieves almost the performance of C
on platforms that have a regular register-based FP arithmetic unit.

However, the x86 floating-point stack (what OCaml uses for
compatibility with Pentium 3 and earlier processors) is notoriously
cranky and hard to generate efficient code for.  gcc manages to
exploit instruction-level parallelism between the "re" and "im"
computations via amazing feats (fxch instructions, etc), but the
ocamlopt x86 code generator just generates very sequential code...

So, unless you have an Alpha at hand, you'd better consider FFT.
There's an FFT implementation that I use as a benchmark here:

       <a href="http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ocaml/test/fft.ml">http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ocaml/test/fft.ml</a>

and it delivers about 2/3 of the performances of C, even on the Pentium.

4) Our shrinking Humps
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sergey Goldgaber worried:

The Caml Humps are just a list of links.  There seems to be no real
archive of contributed OCaml code.  Because of this the community is
losing these contributions as linked web pages disappear (either
because of web-site reorganization, or because the people maintaining
those personal web sites have moved on to something else).

One example is Beno?t de Boursetty's PNM library, which doesn't seem to
be at <a href="http://www.stud.enst.fr/~debourse/projects.html">http://www.stud.enst.fr/~debourse/projects.html</a> any longer, as  
the Humps maintain.  This seems like a valuable library, of practical
use to me right now.  I could try to track down Beno?t de Boursetty, or
ask about this particular library on this list, but that is not an
effective long-term solution for every missing package case.  

There are also all sorts of other libraries and applications which are   
far too advanced for me to make use of right now, but which I could see
myself using a year or two down the road.  But with the web in flux the
way it is, it is not wise to rely on any particular web page still
being there after any length of time.

I could go through and manually download every individual piece of
software, but apart from being extraordinarily tedious, I would loose
all of the Hump's wonderful organization and descriptions.

I think what would be great if all of these packages were available in
a centralized, mirrored repository available for download.  That way,
ideally, people would be able to get every available package and burn
it to CDROM, distributing the entire archive for posterity.

I know there has been talk of a CPAN-like service, and think that would
be great as well.  However, nothing so complex is needed for a simple
centralized archive.  And it is an archive that is needed more.
Otherwise the community loses code.

I wish I had a server and bandwidth to donate, or I would just do this
myself.  As it is I'm making an appeal to the community for solutions.
If there are no individuals or corporate entities in the OCaml
community who are willing/able to provide the required resources,
perhaps we could look at something like ibiblio <a href="http://ibiblio.org/">http://ibiblio.org/</a>
Does anyone have any experience with this service?

Old cwn
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to miss a cwn, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@inria.fr) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/">http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/</a>). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
