* caml_qiskit 0.1.0: quantum computing for Ocaml

** Davide Gessa announced


Hi developers, today I released a (yet) tiny OCaml binding for the quantum computing sdk of IBM, named
qiskit. Qiskit is a python library, so I used /pyml/ for wrapping python classes and modules over OCaml
(that was very easy, pyml worked like a charm).

At the moment the library allows to:
- create a quantum circuit using all the standard gates and draw it
- simulate the quantum circuit execution locally
- send the circuit to IBM quantum computer for real hardware execution

The source code of this is available here: https://github.com/dakk/caml_qiskit , and you will be able to install it using opam where its name is *qiskit*; the library needs python3 + qiskit + matplotlib + numpy to work.

I wrote a medium post showing a basic example:

** Chet Murthy then said


Hi, you might be interested in this code: https://github.com/chetmurthy/qc-ocaml \\
tutorial: https://github.com/chetmurthy/qc-ocaml/blob/master/docs/Tutorial.asciidoc

I wrote it a good while ago, but IIRC I was able to create a circuit, compile to a "circuit", submit a
job, monitor its progress, recover results.

I didn't get around to interfacing with IBM's simulator.

If you find the code useful, I'm happy to re-license under GPL.
      



* Multicore OCaml: July 2020
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-july-2020/6186/1

** Anil Madhavapeddy announced


Welcome to the July 2020 Multicore OCaml report! This update, along with the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly][previous
updates]], has been compiled by @shakthimaan,
@kayceesrk and myself.  There are a number of advances both in upstream OCaml as well as our multicore
trees.

*** Multicore OCaml

**** Thread compatibility via Domain Execution Contexts

_TL;DR: once [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381][#381]] is merged, dune will
work with multicore OCaml._

As I [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-june-2020/6047][noted]] last month, not having a
Thread module that is backwards compatible with traditional OCaml's is a big blocker for ecosystem
compatibility.  This can be a little confusing at first glance -- why does Multicore OCaml need
non-parallel threading support?  The answer lies in the relationship between [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Concurrency-and-parallelism-design-notes][concurrency and
parallelism in multicore
OCaml]].
_Concurrency_ is how we partition multiple computations such that they run in overlapping time periods,
and _parallelism_ is how we run them on separate cores simultaneously to gain greater performance.  A
number of packages (most notably, Dune) currently use the Thread module to conveniently gain
concurrency while writing straight-line code without using monadic abstractions.  These uses do not
require parallelism, but are very difficult to rewrite to not use thread-based concurrency.

Therefore, multicore OCaml also needs a way to provide a reasonably performant version of Thread.  The
first solution we attempted (started by @jhw and continued by @engil in
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/342#issuecomment-643119638][#342]]) mapped a
Thread to a multicore Domain, but scaled poorly for a larger number of threads since we may have a far
greater number of concurrency contexts (Thread instances) than we have CPUs available (Domain
instances). This lead to a bit of brainstorming
([[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/357][#357]]) to figure out a solution that
would work for applications like Dune or the [[https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api][XenServer stack]]
that are heavy Thread users.

Our solution introduces a concept that we have dubbed [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/381][Domain Execution Contexts in
#381]], which allows us to map multiple
system threads to OCaml domains.  Once that PR is reviewed and merged into the multicore OCaml
branches, it will unlock many more ecosystem packages, as the Dune build system will compile
unmodified.  The last "big" remaining blocker for wider opam testing after this is then
ocaml-migrate-parsetree, which requires a small patch to support the ~effect~ keyword syntax that is
present in the multicore OCaml trees.

**** Domain Local Storage

Domain Local Storage (DLS) ([[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/372][#372]]) is a
simple way to attach OCaml values privately to a domain.  A good example of speedup when using DLS is
shown in a PR to the [[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/152][LU decomposition benchmark]]. In
this case, the benchmark needs a lot of random numbers, and initialising them in parallel locally to
the domain is a win.

Another example is the parallel implementation of an evolutionary algorithm (originally suggested by
@per_kristian_lehre in [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/336][#336]]) which
speeds up nicely in [[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/151][#151]] (for those who want to
check the baseline, there is a sequential version in
[[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark/pull/155][#155]] that you can look up in the Sandmark web
interface).

**** Parallel Programming with Multicore OCaml (document)

A tutorial on [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml][Parallel Programming with Multicore
OCaml]] has been made
available. It provides an introduction to Multicore OCaml and explains the concepts of ~Domains~,
~Domainslib~, and ~Channels~. Profiling of OCaml code using ~perf~ and ~Eventlog~ are also illustrated
with examples.

This draft was shared on
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/ocaml/comments/hluzmy/parallel_programming_in_multicore_ocaml_a_tutorial/][Reddit]]
as well as on [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23740869][HackerNews]], so you'll find more chatter
about it there.

**** Coq benchmarks

The Sandmark benchmarking suite for OCaml has been successfully updated to use dune.2.6.0 and builds
for Multicore OCaml 4.10.0. With this major upgrade, we have also been able to include Coq and its
dependencies. We are working on adding more regression Coq benchmarks to the test suite.

*** Upstream OCaml

The upstream OCaml trees have seen a flurry of activity in the 4.12.0dev trees with changes to prepare
for multicore OCaml.  The biggest one is the (to quote @xavierleroy) fabled page-less compactor in
[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9728][ocaml/ocaml#9728]].  This followed on from last month's work
([[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9698][#9698]]) to eliminate the use of the page table when the
compiler is built with the "no-naked-pointers" option, and clears the path for the parallel multicore
OCaml runtime to be integrated in a future release of OCaml.

One of the other changes we hope to get into OCaml 4.12 is the alignment of the use of garbage
collector colours when marking and sweeping. The [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/9756][#9756]]
changes make the upstream runtime use the same scheme we described in the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663][Retrofitting Parallelism
onto OCaml]] ICFP paper, with a few extra improvements that you can
read about in the PR review comments.

If you are curious about the full set of changes, you can see all the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues?q=label%3Amulticore-prerequisite+is%3Aclosed][multicore
prerequisite]]
issues that have been closed to date upstream.

*** Detailed Updates

As with the previous updates, the Multicore OCaml updates are first listed, which are then followed by
the enhancements to the Sandmark benchmarking project. The upstream OCaml ongoing and completed updates
are finally mentioned for your reference.

**** Multicore OCaml

***** Ongoing

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/342][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#342]]
  Implementing the threads library with Domains

  This is an on-going effort to rebase @jhwoodyatt's implementation of the Thread
  library for Domains.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/357][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#357]]
  Implementation of systhreads with pthreads

  A Domain Execution Context (DEC) is being introduced in this
  implementation as a concurrency abstraction for implementing
  systhreads with pthreads.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/374][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#374]]
  Force major slice on minor collection

  A blocked thread in a domain may not progress the major GC when
  servicing the minor collector through ~handle_interrupt~, and hence
  we need to have a minor collection to schedule a major collection
  slice.

***** Completed

****** Domain-Local State

- [[https://github.com/Sudha247/ocaml-multicore/pull/1][Sudha247/ocaml-multicore#1]]
  ~dls_root~ should be deleted before terminal GC

  The deletion of the global root pushes an object on the mark stack,
  and hence a final GC needs to be performed before the terminal GC.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/372][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#372]]
  Domain-local Storage

  The RFC proposal (ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#339)[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/339]
  to implement a Domain-Local Storage has been completed and merged to
  Multicore OCaml.

****** Removal of vestiges in Concurrent Minor GC

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/370][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#370]]
  Remove Cloadmut and lloadmut

  The ~Cloadmut~ and ~Iloadmut~ implementation and usage have been
  cleaned up with this patch. This simplifies the code and brings it
  closer to stock OCaml.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/371][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#371]]
  Domain interrupt cleanup

  In ~runtime/domain.c~ the ~struct interruptor* sender~ has been
  removed. The domain RPC functions have been grouped together in
  ~domain.h~, and consistent naming of definitions have been applied.

****** Code Cleanup

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/367][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#367]]
  Remove some unused RPC consumers

  The domain RPC mechanisms are no longer in use, and have been
  removed.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/368][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#368]]
  Removal of dead bits of read_barrier and caml_promote

  This PR removes ~caml_promote~, the assembly for read faults on ARM
  and AMD, and the global for the read fault.

****** Sundries

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/366][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#366]]
  Add event to record idle domains

  The ~domain/idle_wait~ and ~domain/send_interrupt~ events are added
  to track domains that are idling. An eventlog screenshot with this
  effect is shown below:

  https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/ocaml/optimized/2X/a/a7028229dbf95c975c65faecc99417268024520a_2_1380x596.png

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/369][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#369]]
  Split caml_urge_major_slice into caml_request_minor_gc and
  caml_request_major_slice

  The ~caml_urge_major_slices~ is split into ~caml_request_minor_gc~
  and ~caml_request_major_slice~. This reduces the total number of
  minor garbage collections as observed in the following illustration:

  https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/ocaml/optimized/2X/6/66705c292bab15146adedf8d9f870484a6a87e87_2_1380x406.png

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/373][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#373]]
  Fix the opam pin command in case the current directory name has spaces

  Use the ~-k path~ command-line argument with ~opam pin~ to handle
  directory names that have whitespaces.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/375][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#375]]
  Only lock the global freelist to adopt pools if needed

  The lock acquire and release on allocation is removed when there are
  no global pools requiring adoption.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/pull/377][ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore#377]]
  Group env vars for run in travis CI

  The ~OCAMLRUNPARAM~ parameter is defined as part of the environment
  variable with the ~USE_RUNTIME=d~ command.

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/3608][ocaml/dune#3608]]
  Upstream Multicore dune bootstrap patch

  The patch is used to build dune using the secondary compiler
  approach for
  [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/3548][ocaml/dune#3548]].

** Simon Cruanes announced


I'm glad to announce that [[https://github.com/sneeuwballen/benchpress][benchpress]] is now available in
0.1.

Benchpress is a test/benchmarking tool designed for automated theorem provers (including SMT solvers
and first-order provers), both to run a bunch of provers, and to display their results. Results are
stored in sqlite files, one per run. The sister package ~benchpress-server~ contains a daemon that
provides a web interface to examine the results; a read-only live instance [[https://benchpress.cedeela.fr/][can be seen
here]].

These are early days for benchpress but it could be of interest to the sub-community of logicians here

* containers 3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-containers-3-0/6194/1

** Simon Cruanes announced


I'm happy to announce, on behalf of containers' contributors, the release of [[https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/releases/tag/v3.0][containers
3.0]]. API documentation can be found
[[https://c-cube.github.io/ocaml-containers/3.0/][here]].

Containers is a BSD-licensed standard library _extension_ [1] that aims at being lightweight,
convenient, modular, portable, and only pay for what you use; that includes compatibility with OCaml >=
4.03. This is the second major update in 7 years of existence, following semantic versioning.

Release 3.0 was the opportunity to clean up some inconsistencies (in printers, among others), to focus
on the standard ~Seq.t~ type, and to split some sub-libraries into their own packages
(~containers-thread~ and ~containers-data~ respectively). The hope is that the new version is more
consistent, lightweight, and pleasant to use.

I want to thank all contributors for their hard work, and in particular
[[https://github.com/FardaleM][Fardale]].

[1]: as in, containers extends the stdlib and does not intend to replace it.

*** Overview of breaking changes

(this is extracted from [[https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/blob/master/README.md#to-30][the readme's migration section]])

1. The biggest change is that some sub-libraries have been either turned into
   their own packages (~containers-thread~, ~containers-data~),
   deleted (~containers.iter~),or merged elsewhere (~containers.sexp~).
   This means that if use these libraries you will have to edit your
   ~dune~/~_oasis~/~opam~ files.

   - if you use ~containers.sexp~ (i.e. the ~CCSexp~ module), it now lives in
     ~containers~ itself.
   - if you used anything in ~containers.data~, you need to depend on the
     ~containers-data~ package now.

2. Another large change is the removal (at last!) of functions deprecated
   in 2.8, related to the spread of ~Seq.t~ as the standard iterator type.
   Functions like ~CCVector.of_seq~ now operate on this standard ~Seq.t~ type,
   and old-time iteration based on [[https://github.com/c-cube/iter][iter]]
   is now named ~of_iter~, ~to_iter~, etc.

   Here you need to change you code, possibly using search and replace.
   Thankfully, the typechecker should guide you.

3. ~Array_slice~ and ~String.Sub~ have been removed to simplify the
   code and ~String~ more lightweight. There is no replacement at the moment.
   Please tell us if you need this to be turned into a sub-library.

4. Renaming of some functions into more explicit/clear names.
   Examples:

   - ~CCVector.shrink~ is now ~CCVector.truncate~
   - ~CCVector.remove~ is now ~CCVector.remove_unordered~, to be
     contrasted with the new ~CCVector.remove_and_shift~.
   - ~CCPair.map_fst~ and ~map_snd~ now transform a tuple into another tuple
     by modify the first (resp. second) element.

5. All the collection pretty-printers now take their separator/start/stop
   optional arguments as ~unit printer~ (i.e. ~Format.formatter -> unit -> unit~
   functions) rather than strings. This gives the caller better control
   over the formatting of lists, arrays, queues, tables, etc.

6. Removal of many deprecated functions.

* opam-bin: binary packages for OPAM, beta release

** Fabrice Le Fessant announced


I am happy to announce the first public release of ~opam-bin~, a
framework to create, use and share binary packages with opam:

https://ocamlpro.github.io/opam-bin

With opam-bin, you can :

- build binary packages while installing their source counterpart with opam
- automatically reuse previously created binary packages instead of compiling them again
- export and share your binary packages as part of opam repositories for other users/computers to use

~opam-bin~ is a framework in 3 parts :
- a tool ~opam-bin~ to create binary packages: https://ocamlpro.github.io/opam-bin
- a set of patches to make some packages relocatable (~opam-bin~ will apply them automatically when building packages): https://github.com/ocamlpro/relocation-patches
- a set of contributed repositories of binary packages. For now, there is only one "example" (https://www.origin-labs.com/opam-bin/debian10.4-amd64/ ) but we hope more people will contribute them in the future.

This is the first public release, it should be considered as a "beta
release", though we have tested it a lot in the last days.

~opam-bin~ is a collaborative work between OCamlPro and Origin Labs.
      

** Fabrice Le Fessant later added


Little update: the binary repository for OCaml 4.10.0 has been expanded to contain a set of 1800+
binary packages:

** dosaylazy announced


I would like to announce my first two OPAM packages,
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/plist-xml/plist-xml.0.1/][plist-xml]] and
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/plist-xml-lwt/plist-xml-lwt.0.1/][plist-xml-lwt]]. These two packages
build upon the [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/markup/markup.0.8.2/][markup]] and
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/markup-lwt/markup-lwt.0.5.0/][markup-lwt]] libraries to read and write
plist files expressed as XML.

I originally wrote this code to process the TextMate grammar files found in
https://github.com/github/linguist/tree/master/vendor. I hope that other people can find good use of
these two libraries. Please report any bugs as well as any inconveniences in the API.
      



* Call to testers (OCaml 4.11.0, release candidate)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 10
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-call-to-testers-ocaml-4-11-0-release-candidate/6205/1

** Kate announced


The release of OCaml version 4.11.0 is imminent. We have created a release candidate that you can test.
For users of the beta releases, this release candidate is exactly the same as the last beta release
except for a minor fix for the ~#show~ directive in the toplevel.

*** --- :sparkles: The opam ecosystem ---

The opam ecosystem is in good shape for this release candidate.
For maximum compatibility, you can use the following
[[https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository/][opam-alpha-repository]]:

#+begin_src shell
$ opam repo add alpha https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git
#+end_src

during your tests. This repository integrate not-yet-upstreamed or unreleased fixes to various
packages.
With this repository all except a handful of packages are compatible with this release candidate.

Using opam-alpha-repository:
- *All core tools* (see [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/16539][meta issue]]) –
*including Merlin* :tada: – work, except for ocaml-lsp-server (which is not officially released yet
and only relevant for Windows users).

- *All packages* except 7 over the 2134 available packages in opam-repository that were compatible
with OCaml 4.10 are also compatible with OCaml 4.11.

*** --- :checkered_flag: Call to testers ---

Given that the release is very close and the state of the community packages stable enough, we would
like to encourage people to give it a try before the release, especially for those on non-x86_64
architectures. I've personally been using OCaml 4.11 almost exclusively for the past 3 months and did
not really encountered any issues on my x86_64 machine with a fairly regular setup.

Give it a try! Happy testing! :milky_way:
      

** Anil Madhavapeddy then said


And a huge thank you to @kit-ty-kate who has done an extraordinary amount of behind-the-scenes work for
this release.  This is the first time we're experimenting with the idea of an "OCaml Readiness Team" of
the maintainers of the various core tools, and she has [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/16539][superbly
coordinated]] those projects along with the wider
opam-repository (along with a large amount of direct compatibility fixing).

Due to this effort, for the first time since we started disaggregating tools out of the core OCaml
distribution starting about 8 years ago, the forthcoming releases of OCaml should come with tooling
that is ready for that release from day 1.  Props to all the maintainers for your hard work -- I'll be
talking about how this is working more in the forthcoming OCaml Workshop in a few weeks.

** Kate announced


The release of OCaml version 4.10.1 is imminent. @octachron and the rest of the compiler dev team have
created a release candidate that you can test.

The source code is available at these addresses:

[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.1+rc1.tar.gz][https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.1+rc1.tar.gz]] \\

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands.

#+begin_example
opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.10.1+rc1 --repositories=default,beta=git://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
#+end_example

We want to know about any bugs. Please report them here:
[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues]]

If every goes well, the full release should follow next week.

* OCamlformat 0.15.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 12
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocamlformat-0-15-0/6210/1

** Guillaume Petiot announced


On behalf of the development team, I’d like to announce the release of ocamlformat version 0.15.0
:tada:.

Here are the main highlights of this release:

*** Support for OCaml 4.11

This means both that it compiles and runs using this version, but also that it can format 4.11-specific
language features (quoted extensions: ~{%foo|...|}~).

*** Compatibility with base and stdio v0.14.0

This compatibility has been restored since ocamlformat-0.14.3 but wasn't publicly announced,
ocamlformat is now compatible from base v0.12.0 to v0.14.0 included.

*** Bugfixes

Many bugs and unoptimal formatting were also fixed in this release:

- Do not break inline elements such as ~{i blah}~ in docstrings
- Distinguish hash-getter from hash-comparison infix operators. Operators of the form ~#**#~ or ~#**.~ where ~**~ can be 0 or more operator chars are considered getter operators and are not surrounded by spaces, as opposed to regular infix operators
- Type constraint on return type of functions is now always printed before the function body
- Restore previous functionality for pre-post extension points
- Fix extra break before ~function~ body of a ~fun~
  Indent further args of anonymous functions
- Do not clear the emacs ~*compilation*~ buffer on successful reformat
- Fix disabling with attributes on OCaml < 4.08
- Preserve unwrapped comments by not adding artificial breaks when ~wrap-comments=false~ and ~ocp-indent-compat=true~ are set to avoid interfering with ocp-indent indentation
- Break long literal strings at the margin
- Break after a multiline argument in an argument list
- Remove unnecessary parens around object
- Fix placement of comments on constants
- Do not escape arguments of some Odoc tags. The characters ~[]{}~ must not be escaped in the arguments of ~@raise~, ~@author~, ~@version~ and others.
- Fix missing open line between multi-line let-binding with poly-typexpr
- Remove trailing space after expression when followed by an attribute and break before attributes attached to multi-line phrases
- Do not add a space to minimal comments ~(* *)~, ~(** *)~ and ~(*$ *)~
- Fix attributes position in labelled arguments type
- Add missing parens around type annotation in anonymous function
- Fix alignment of 'then' keyword in parenthesised expression
- Recognise eliom file extensions

*** A note for new users

We encourage you to try ocamlformat, that can be installed from opam directly ( ~opam install
ocamlformat~ ), but please remember that it is still beta software. We added a [[https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#faq-for-new-users][FAQ for new users
]] that should help you decide if
ocamlformat is the right choice for you.
