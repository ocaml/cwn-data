I've done my homework and I've collected few links about bdd
libraries. I still have few questions: 

+ Is there a native (and efficient) ocaml BDD implementation ? In
 particular, as pointed out on this mailing list, with variable ordering
 and other possible optimizations that can be compared in speed with
 buddy/cudd (c/c++).

= From what I can see, the answer is no. A lot of toy implementations
 though...

+ Do you know if there is an ocaml binding for buddy ? 

= I guess no, but I hope I'm wrong...

+ Does anybody have experience with the bindings done at inrialpes to
 CUDD ? Is this project still actively maintained / used ? How does it
 compare efficiency-wise with other bdd libraries ?

+ If I was to start writing my ocaml bindings, which c/c++ library would
 you advice ? Buddy seems widely used, but I wasn't able to find any
 hard evidence that it is the best bdd library available... Do you know 
 of any paper surveying different bdd implementations ?

thanks :)

==Relevant Mailing list Messages==

The ocaml ml has several references to BDDs. These are 3 interesting threads
that I've used as a starting point for my research. 

In this thread
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2000/01/405b651014b09c51c691aab72d69166a.en.html
there is mention of a possible binding for Jørn Lind-Nielsen's BDD
library BuDDy. I'm wondering if this binding was ever released.

In this thread
http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_frm/thread/4af5391f52279e38/550b7df324ae1900#550b7df324ae1900
Alain Frish points out that none of existing ocaml libraries implements
automatic reordering of variables... And I don't know if the state of affairs
is changed at this regard.

In this thread
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2001/04/8bbf7629ef3ef299c16f78bd2b986e36.en.html
David Mentre announces a preliminary work on binding for the cudd
library, but the link is broken... this link currently is broken:
http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~mentre/software/ocaml-bdd/ 
and there is a mention to a caml-light implementation of a robdd library
that I was also not able to retrieve.

			<cwn_what>
&gt; I have the following situation: 
&gt; 
&gt; - a signature S 
&gt; - two modules A and B, which both implement S 
&gt; - an ocamlyacc file which refers to an implementation of S 
&gt; 
&gt; I want to generate two executable, one where A is used and another 
&gt; where B is used. 
&gt; 
&gt; The most logical thing would be to turn the ocamlyacc part into a 
&gt; functor which accepts an implementation of S. But there does not seem 
&gt; to be any way of doing this. What can I do? 
&gt; 
&gt; Can menhir do this?

Yes, Menhir has a keyword (%parameter) that allows precisely this.

Here is what I mostly like (you have a comparison table here
&lt;http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~raffalli/ocaml-parsing.html&gt;:

dypgen :

- GLR instead of LR(1) : this gives much more elegant description of the
  grammar (and the possibiliy of ambigous grammar) and there is never a
  conflict. These are replaced by multiple parse trees (you can choose a merge
  function that will report that as an error, if you think your grammar should
  not be ambiguous).

- pattern matching in rule. Example: you define a grammar for list of
  expressions of any-size, but you can restrict the usage to list of length at
  least 1, 2, ... by pattern matching)

- late reject of a rule by raising an exception.

- self extensible lexer and parser with delimited scope.

menhir :

- should be faster because it is only LR(1), but I did not test

- you know for sure that your grammer is not ambiguous ...

Here is a Linux -&gt; Win32 OCaml cross-compiler, developed and sponsored
by Red Hat's Fedora MinGW project[1].  Red Hat are sponsoring this
project so that we can build our OCaml virt tools for Windows without
the hassle of using Windows.

 http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/fedora-mingw--devel/
 (There is no direct link - to get the latest version you have
 to click "manifest" then "ocaml").

If you're not familiar with RPM builds, then start with the .spec file
and the patches.  Pay close attention to the 'BuildRequires' which are
the parts of the MinGW project you will need to build it - in
particular, we use a version of FlexDLL which we have modified for
cross-compilation.

It's probably best to say what does work, because the list of what
_doesn't_ work is quite long.  But with this you get:

 i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlopt
      The cross-compiler replacement for ocamlopt
         (bytecode so you need a corresponding
          ocamlrun interpreter to use it)

 *.cmx, *.cmxa
      The usual OCaml stdlib libraries, eg. nums, dynlink, unix, threads
         (only lightly tested)

eg:

 $ cat /tmp/test.ml

 open Printf

 let () =
   printf "reported os_type = %S\n" Sys.os_type;
   printf "ok\n"

 $ boot/ocamlrun i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlopt -verbose -I stdlib /tmp/test.ml \
   -o /tmp/test.exe
 + i686-pc-mingw32-as -o '/tmp/test.o' '/tmp/camlasm56b36c.s'
 + i686-pc-mingw32-as -o '/tmp/camlstartup4b26a5.o' '/tmp/camlstartup76cf6d.s'
 + flexlink -chain mingw -exe -o '/tmp/test.exe'  -I'/usr/lib64/i686-pc-mingw32-ocaml' '-Lstdlib' '-L/usr/lib64/i686-pc-mingw32-ocaml' '/tmp/camlstartup4b26a5.o' 'stdlib/std_exit.o' '/tmp/test.o' 'stdlib/stdlib.a' 'stdlib/libasmrun.a'  

 $ file /tmp/test.exe 
 /tmp/test.exe: PE32 executable for MS Windows (console) Intel 80386 32-bit

 $ wine /tmp/test.exe
 reported os_type = "Win32"
 ok

There are about a million things to fix, but this should be enough to
get people started.

			<cwn_url>http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/0d089365ca982195#</cwn_url>
			<cwn_who>Benjamin Canou announced</cwn_who>

O'Browser is an implementation of the OCaml virtual machine in JavaScript,
designed to run in web browsers.
It features a runtime library compatible with OCaml's standard one (including
OOP and concurrent threads) and bindings of some JavaScript functions to
manipulate the DOM primitives.

The distribution is available at [1] and an online version of the tutorial is
reachable at [2].

Please note that this is an early version, in particular the DOM interface
module is neither pretty nor well typed.
However, it can already be used to create little applets or scripts (as in the
tutorial [2], the examples of the distribution [3] or my webpage [4]) and
we'll be glad to receive your comments or bug reports.

Have fun.

Benjamin Canou.
