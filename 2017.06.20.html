&gt; Is there a suite of micro-benchmarks for floating-point operations in
&gt; OCaml?  If so, could someone point me to such suite(s)?

While they are not "micro-benchmarks" in the sense of "testing only one
operation", the set of short-running benchmarks in operf-micro contains
many short floating-point-heavy programs (almabench, fft, kahan_sum...):

I am wondering if some high performance OCaml experts out there
can know in advance if some code can go faster by executing it
on a GPU.

I'd like to get some feeling before I invest into some new technology.

I'd like to stay in OCaml, not drop down to C.
So I mention SPOC, SAREK and MetaOCaml which look like the right technologies.

I have some clear bottleneck in my program.
Here is how the code looks like:

---
let f (points: (Vector3.t * float) list) =
  let acc = ref [] in
  let ac p1 x (p2, y) =
    acc := (Vector3.dist p1 p2, x *. y) :: !acc
  in
  let rec loop = function
    | [] -&gt; ()
    | (p1, x) :: xs -&gt;
      L.iter (ac p1 x) xs;
      loop xs
  in
  loop points;
  !acc
---

So, in terms of size: each point is 3 floats (a 3D coordinate) plus 1 float
(some value).
I usually have several thousands of points, but less than 10_000.

The f function will be called thousands of times for one run of the program
(let's say 300k calls is a big but reasonable use case).

I don't care about the order of points in the input list.

I also don't care about the order of the results in acc.

I very probably don't care about using single point precision (32 bit floats)
for everything, instead of double precision.

Thanks a lot for any feedback.

Best regards,
Francois.

PS: vector3 is available in opam, if that helps

As a baseline before attempting anything on the GPU, I'd vectorize
this. Put all your vectors in a big matrix. Put all your numbers in a
vector. Compute the distances and the products all at once using
Lacaml (make sure you use OpenBLAS as a backend). I'd expect it to be
much faster than the above loop already.
      </pre><i>Ivan Gotovchits also replied:</i><br /><pre>
Your code is actually bound by memory, not by computation. The problem is
that you create lots of data, and all the time is spent in the allocation
functions and GC. The actual computation consumes less than 5% of overall
program execution, that can be easily seen by profiling (always profile
before starting optimization). Thus moving to GPU will make this 5% of code
run faster, at the expense of even higher overhead of moving data between
CPU and GPU.

So, let's see how we can optimize your code. First of all, your code uses
too much mutable state, that can have a negative performance impact in
OCaml due to write barriers. Let's make it a little bit cleaner and faster:


let nonmutab points =
  let rec loop xs acc = match xs with
    | [] -&gt; acc
    | (x,w) :: xs -&gt;
      List.fold_left (fun acc (x',w') -&gt;
          (Vector3.dist x x', w *. w') :: acc) acc xs |&gt;
      loop xs in
  loop points []

This code runs a little bit faster (on 10000 points):

original: 14084.1 ms
nonmutab: 11309.2 ms

It computes absolutely the same result, using the same computational core,
and allocating the same amount of trash. The only difference is that we are
not using a mutable state anymore, and we are rewarded for that.

The next step is to consider, do you really need to produce these
intermediate structures, if the result of your program is the computed
data, then you can just store it in a file. Or, if you need later this data
to be reduced to some value, then you shouldn't create an intermediate
result, and apply the reduction in place (so called de-foresting). So,
let's generalize a little bit the function so that instead of producing a
new list, the function just applies a user-provided function to all
produced elements, along with an accumulator.

let nonalloc f acc points =
  let rec loop xs acc = match xs with
    | [] -&gt; acc
    | (x,w) :: xs -&gt;
      List.fold_left (fun acc (x',w') -&gt;
          f acc (Vector3.dist x x') (w *. w')) acc xs |&gt;
      loop xs in
  loop points acc



This function will not allocate any unnecessary data (it will though
allocate a pair of floats per each call). So we can use this function to
implement the `nonmutab` version, by passing a consing operator and an
empty list. We can also try to use it to store data. The data storage
process depends on how fast we can reformat the data, and how fast is the
sink device. If we will output to /dev/null (that is known to be fast),
then we can use the Marshal module and get about 300 MB/s throughtput. Not
bad, but still about 10 seconds of running time. If, for example, we just
need some scalar metrics, then we don't need to pay an overhead of data,
and it will be as fast as possible. For example, with the following
implementations of the kernel function

let flags = [Marshal.No_sharing]

let print () x1 x2 =
  Marshal.to_channel stdout x1 flags;
  Marshal.to_channel stdout x2 flags

let product total x1 x2 = total +. x1 *. x2


We will have the following timings:

printall: 9649.54 ms
nonalloc: 541.186 ms


So, the actual computation took only half a second, the rest is data
processing.

Please find attached the whole example. You can run it with the following
command:

ocamlbuild -pkgs vector3,unix points.native -- &gt; /dev/null
