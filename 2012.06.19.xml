Update to oasis v0.3.0~rc6

Download:

This library provides a variety of cryptographic primitives that can be used
to implement cryptographic protocols in security-sensitive applications. The
primitives provided include:

- Symmetric-key ciphers: AES, DES, Triple-DES, ARCfour,
in ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB modes.
- Public-key cryptography: RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
- Hash functions and MACs: SHA-1, MD5, and MACs based on AES and DES.
- Random number generation.
- Encodings and compression: base 64, hexadecimal, Zlib compression.

Additional ciphers and hashes can easily be used in conjunction with
the library. In particular, basic mechanisms such as chaining modes,
output buffering, and padding are provided by generic classes that can
easily be composed with user-provided ciphers. More generally, the library
promotes a "Lego"-like style of constructing and composing
transformations over character streams.

This is a simple implementation of `expect` to help building unitary testing
of interactive program.

It helps to receive question and send answers from an interactive process.
You can match the question using a regular expression (Str). You can also
use a timeout to ensure that the process answer in time.

See the [Expect manual](&lt;http://expect.nist.gov/&gt;) for more information and
example.

Tonight one more new ocaml library was born, please welcome :

ocaml-gperftools 0.1
--------------------

gperftools &lt;https://code.google.com/p/gperftools&gt; library provides interface 
to control tcmalloc behavior. This may be useful to
ocaml programs which delegate heavy lifting to C code, hence the ocaml 
bindings.

Located at http://gperftools.forge.ocamlcore.org/

ocaml-extunix 0.0.5
-------------------

ExtUnix aims to collect thin bindings to various low-level system API in one 
library with consistent interface.
This release includes build compatibility tweaks, fixes potential crash with 
upcoming OCaml 4 (thanks to Gerd Stolpmann for raising this
issue on caml-list) and makes oUnit an optional dependency.

      <cwn_title>Call for Participation: Mancoosi International Solver Competition</cwn_title>

The Mancoosi International Solver Competition (MISC)
http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/
Call for Participation


IRILL, the the Center for Research and Innovation on Free Software,
calls for the third international competition of solvers for
package/component installation and upgrade problems. Instances of
these problems are given by a set of currently installed or available
software packages, with complex relations between them like
dependencies, conflicts, and features. The problem instances used in
the competition are expressed in a language called CUDF that allows to
express relationships between components like they are known for
instance in GNU/Linux distributions, or for Eclipse plugins. We are
not only interested in finding some solution to such a problem, but in
finding the best solution according to different optimization
criteria. For a detailed description please look at the competition
web page

http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/

Participating solvers will be judged by the correctness of the
solution, the quality of the solution according to the respective
optimization criteria, and speed. The results of the competition will
be announced on September, 8, at the LoCoCo workshop at ICLP 2012
(&lt;http://lococo.irill.org/2012&gt;).

Timeline:
- August, 1: Registration of participants by email to
misc-committee at sympa.mancoosi.univ-paris-diderot.fr
- August, 13: Submission of solvers
- September, 8: announcement of the results

      <cwn_title>FAN 0.1</cwn_title>

      <cwn_what>
Fan &lt;http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/fan_doc/&gt; ,
a* type-directed generic programming framework for OCaml*
Using Fan, a programmer can easily create generic libraries
for type-directed
programs, including pretty printing, equality, serialization and
deserialization, data generation, generic traversals, folds, etc.

Compared with deriving &lt;http://code.google.com/p/deriving/&gt;, Fan is mainly
different in such aspects:
1. It generate code *without touching your source tree*, module is
the basic unit. We generated code* fo**r all modules in ocaml's compiler*
*parsing/, typing/, and bootstrapped camlp4 source tree itself*.
Check here http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/fan_doc/
All modules beginning with Fan_ocaml is generated code for ocaml compiler
Fan_camlp4ast_o is for camlp4ast itself.
2. composable.  All extended syntax are in our mini dsl language "fan"
without polluting the original syntax
3. Lightweight   Check the modules
gen_plugins&lt;http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/fan_doc/code_Gen_plugins.html&gt;
we write generic printing, equality, map, fold traversal, etc,* 9 generic
plugins in less than 200 lines of code*.

It's still at alpha stage, and I have some ideas that need to be polished, *I
would be happy **to hear any feedback.* We hope that FAN can benefit ocaml
community* as a camlp4 platform.* Fan's code base is pretty small, all the
Ast Transformations are based on quasi-quotations. The only exception is
TyDcl which has no counter-part and Ast Lifting, since *the current camlp4
does not support  macro syntax in **common lisp something like ``(,,).*
      </cwn_what>
			<cwn_who>Bob Zhang later added</cwn_who>
			<cwn_what>
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/fan.zip
It's planned to release after ocaml's 4.00 release since some ideas still
need to be polished
 but you can have a look to get a general idea.
One thing to add is that *Fan is not just a generic printer, it is a
framework that*
*you can write generic printer or whatever you want in tens of lines* :-)
