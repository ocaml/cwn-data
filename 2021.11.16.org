** Damien Guichard announced


Please report bugs, bad English & nonsenses.
But do not report omissions (it is work-in-progress plus it's not an ocaml bible).

https://www.cjoint.com/c/KKjulI1Dx03

Why the book is not bottom up, instead some concepts are used without explained ?

- Because some notions (what is the ~unit~ type ? what is a queue ?) are considered easy-enough to go without saying.

What will be in the missing chapter 6 ?

- Type polymorphism, universal quantification, ~Stdlib.compare~, weak polymorphism, constrained polymorphism, phantom types, type variance.

What will be in the chapters 12 and more ?
- High performance lexing
- Recursive-descent parsing
- The art of searching
- Detailed construction of the ERic 0.3 application

Will the source files go to a repository ?

- No. The source files are already included in the zip archive.
      



* pyml_bindgen: a CLI app to generate Python bindings directly from OCaml value specifications

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-pyml-bindgen-a-cli-app-to-generate-python-bindings-directly-from-ocaml-value-specifications/8786/1

** Ryan Moore announced


I wanted to announce the first release of [[https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen][pyml_bindgen]], a CLI
app for generating Python bindings using [[https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml/][pyml]] directly from OCaml value
specifications.

Manually writing bindings to Python libraries can get tedious pretty quickly.  ~pyml_bindgen~ aims to help you avoid
a lot of the repetitive work when binding Python libraries by letting you focus on the OCaml side of things and
(mostly) not worrying about the implementation of the pyml bindings.

*** Quick start

First, install ~pyml_bindgen~.  It is available on [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/pyml_bindgen/][Opam]].

#+begin_example
$ opam install pyml_bindgen
#+end_example

Say you have a Python class you want to bind and use in OCaml.  (Filename: ~adder.py~)

#+begin_src python
class Adder:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
#+end_src

To do so, you write OCaml value specifications for the class and methods you want to bind.  (Filename:
~val_specs.txt~)

#+begin_src ocaml
val add : x:int -> y:int -> unit -> int
#+end_src

Then, you run ~pyml_bindgen~.

#+begin_example
$ pyml_bindgen val_specs.txt adder Adder --caml-module Adder > lib.ml
#+end_example

Now you can use your generated functions in your OCaml code.  (Filename: ~run.ml~)

#+begin_src ocaml
open Lib

let () = Py.initialize ()

let result = Adder.add ~x:1 ~y:2 ()

let () = assert (result = 3)
#+end_src

Finally, set up a dune file and run it.

#+begin_example
(executable
 (name run)
 (libraries pyml))
#+end_example

#+begin_example
$ dune exec ./run.exe
#+end_example

*** Documentation

For more information on installing and using ~pyml_bindgen~, check out the
[[https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_python_bindgen/][docs]].  There you will find lots of tips and examples to help you
get started!

** Thomas Leonard announced


ocaml-wayland has been very stable over the last few months and so I've now released [[https://github.com/talex5/ocaml-wayland/releases/tag/v1.0][version 1.0]]. The main changes are improved error handling and
diagnostics.

I've been using this to write an Xwayland adaptor, which acts as an X11 window manager to Xwayland, converting
between the two protocols. This allows running X11 apps in VMs and having them appear alongside other application
windows on the host. It can also be used to fix other problems, such as support for HiDPI screens and Sway's buggy
clipboard support:

I'm happy to announce the availability on opam of [[https://github.com/biocaml/phylogenetics][phylogenetics]], a
bioinformatics library dedicated to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_evolution][molecular evolution]] and
phylogeny. It provides a few algorithms and data structures that can be useful to study how biological sequences like
proteins or genes have evolved, or to simulate datasets under various evolutionary models.

Comments/questions welcomed on the repo's issue tracker!

** UnixJunkie announced


I am pleased to announce the availability in opam of the svmwrap package.
A wrapper around libsvm's svm-train and svm-predict executables.
Currently, only regression modeling is supported, using the linear, RBF, sigmoid or polynomial kernel.

https://github.com/UnixJunkie/svmwrap

The quite scary usage looks like this:
#+begin_example
usage: svmwrap
  -i <filename>: training set or DB to screen
  --feats <int>: number of features
  [-o <filename>]: predictions output file
  [-np <int>]: ncores
  [--kernel <string>] choose kernel type {Lin|RBF|Sig|Pol}
  [-c <float>]: fix C
  [-e <float>]: epsilon in the loss function of epsilon-SVR;
  (0 <= epsilon <= max_i(|y_i|))
  [-g <float>]: fix gamma (for RBF and Sig kernels)
  [-r <float>]: fix r for the Sig kernel
  [--iwn]: turn ON instance-wise-normalization
  [--scale]: turn ON [0:1] scaling (NOT PRODUCTION READY)
  [--no-plot]: no gnuplot
  [{-n|--NxCV} <int>]: folds of cross validation
  [-q]: quiet
  [-v|--verbose]: equivalent to not specifying -q
  [--seed <int>]: fix random seed
  [-p <float>]: training set portion (in [0.0:1.0])
  [--pairs]: read from .AP files (atom pairs; will offset feat. indexes by 1)
  [--train <train.liblin>]: training set (overrides -p)
  [--valid <valid.liblin>]: validation set (overrides -p)
  [--test <test.liblin>]: test set (overrides -p)
  [{-l|--load} <filename>]: prod. mode; use trained models
  [{-s|--save} <filename>]: train. mode; save trained models
  [-f]: force overwriting existing model file
  [--scan-c]: scan for best C
  [--scan-e <int>]: epsilon scan #steps for SVR
  [--scan-g]: scan for best gamma
  [--regr]: regression (SVR); also, implied by -e and --scan-e
  [--e-range <float>:<int>:<float>]: specific range for e
  (semantic=start:nsteps:stop)
  [--c-range <float,float,...>] explicit scan range for C
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
  [--g-range <float,float,...>] explicit range for gamma
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
  [--r-range <float,float,...>] explicit range for r
  (example='0.01,0.02,0.03')
#+end_example

For people who know my linwrap opam package (a wrapper around liblinear tools), this is quite similar.

* GeoPub - A XMPP web client
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-geopub-a-xmpp-web-client/8819/1

** pukkamustard announced


I'd like to announce an initial, proof-of-concept release of GeoPub - an XMPP web client. Unlike many XMPP clients
the focus is not on instant messaging but on creating, displaying and managing things such as events, maps,
information on local organizations and other local knowledge (see [[https://openengiadina.net][the openEngiadina]]
project for the context).

This initial release is not really anything useful but a proof-of-concept how such an application can be developed
using XMPP and OCaml. There are many rough edges and broken hacks that need fixing. I'd be very grateful for your
feedback, thoughts and ideas.

The source code of the app is on [[https://codeberg.org/openEngiadina/geopub][codeberg]] and a pre-built hosted version
is available [[https://geopub.openengiadina.net/][here]].

The application consists of some parts and ideas that I'd like to illustrate separately:

*** ocaml-xmpp

[[https://codeberg.org/openEngiadina/ocaml-xmpp][ocaml-xmpp]] is a XMPP client library for OCaml (documentation
available [[https://inqlab.net/projects/ocaml-xmpp/][online]].

**** Reactive
ocaml-xmpp is reactive in the sense that the XMPP connection is abstracted as a React event of Stanzas (small pieces
of information that flow over XMPP):

#+begin_src ocaml
val stanzas : t -> Stanza.t React.event
#+end_src

This React event can be filtered for messages in a specific conversation, for example.

**** Transports

XMPP works with different transport mechanisms and ocaml-xmpp supports this. Currently ocaml-xmpp can be used from
Unix with a TCP/SSL connection to a XMPP server and from web browsers with a WebSocket connection. This is
implemented by abstracting the XMPP transport:

#+begin_src ocaml
module type TRANSPORT = sig
  (** {2 Connection} *)

  type options
  (** Additional options that may be passed to the transport *)

  type t
  (** Type of an instantiated connection to an XMPP server *)

  val connect : host:string -> options -> t Lwt.t

  val close : t -> unit Lwt.t

  val closed : t -> unit Lwt.t

  (** {2 XML Stream} *)

  type stream

  val open_stream : t -> to':string -> stream Lwt.t

  val stream_id : stream -> string Lwt.t

  val send_xml : stream -> Xmlc.t -> unit Lwt.t

  val signals : stream -> Xmlc.signal Lwt_stream.t

  val stop_stream : stream -> unit Lwt.t
end
#+end_src

A transport establishes the underlying connection to a server and can create XML streams (in XMPP a connection is by
multiple XML streams sequentially). For technical reasons XML parsing is also handled by the transport and a stream
of XML signals (element start, data, element end) is returned. This is due to the fact that XML parsing in XMPP needs
to be done slightly differently when using TCP (a single XML document over the entire stream) or WebSockets (every
WebSocket frame is a parse-able XML document).

The Unix/TCP/SSL transport uses Markup.ml and whereas the WebSocket transport uses Xmlm (and Brrr).

**** Parser combinators for XML

For parsing streams of XML signals to OCaml types ocaml-xmpp contains a parser combinator helper library:
[[https://inqlab.net/projects/ocaml-xmpp/xmlc/Xmlc/index.html][Xmlc]]. This allows parser for XML such as this:

#+begin_src xml
<bind xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind'><jid>w4iu4ckn3kjbqvcd@demo.openengiadina.net/z8Pkzfa8</jid></bind>
#+end_src

to be parses like this:

#+begin_src ocaml
Xmlc.Parser.(
  element (Ns.bind "bind") (fun _ ->
    element (Ns.bind "jid") (fun _ ->
      text >>| String.concat "" >>= fun jid_s ->
      match Jid.of_string jid_s with
      | Some jid -> return jid
      | None -> fail_with "invalid JID")))
#+end_src

**** XMPP extensions

Inspiration for the scope of the core library is taken from the [[http://strophe.im/][Strophe]] XMPP libraries -
everything that does not have directly to do with XMPP transport, authentication or stream management is kept outside
of the core library.

There are already some "extension" libraries outside of the core for useful XMPP features (e.g. [[https://inqlab.net/projects/ocaml-xmpp/xmpp/Xmpp_roster/index.html][Roster
management]],
[[https://inqlab.net/projects/ocaml-xmpp/xmpp/Xmpp_pubsub/index.html][PubSub]] and
[[https://inqlab.net/projects/ocaml-xmpp/xmpp/Xmpp_ping/index.html][pinging]]).

One thing that I do want to add to the core library is stream management according to
[[https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html][XEP-0198]]. I expect this addition to change the core library API - the
API is not stable yet!

Much inspiration was taken from [[https://github.com/hannesm/jackline][Jackline]] - an OCaml XMPP client - and in
particular [[https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Jackline][this post]] on Jackline. Many thanks to @hannes.

*** reactor

GeoPub uses Brr. I had some trouble figuring out a suitable "architecture" for managing complex logic and ended up
hacking an [[https://elm-lang.org/][Elm]] inspired helper library:
[[https://codeberg.org/openEngiadina/geopub/src/branch/main/src/reactor/reactor.mli][reactor.mli]]. State updates for
the entire application are then handled in a single [[https://codeberg.org/openEngiadina/geopub/src/branch/main/src/geopub/main.ml#L28][update
function]].

I'm not yet very happy with this machinery and I'm pretty sure I'm using react in wrong and dangerous ways. I'd be
very grateful for ideas on how to improve this. THis might be related to this discussion:
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/structuring-frp-specifically-note-applications/8645/17.

The reason for using React over Note is because ocaml-xmpp uses a lot of Lwt and ~Lwt_react~ provides nice bindings
for working with both. I guess something similar could be created for Note (e.g. ~Lwt_note~) and I'm open to using
Note (also in ocaml-xmpp).

*** Leaflet

GeoPub displays a map using the [[https://leafletjs.com/][Leaflet.js]] JavaScript library. GeoPub contains OCaml
bindings to Leaflet using Brr:
[[https://codeberg.org/openEngiadina/geopub/src/branch/main/src/leaflet/leaflet.mli][leaflet.mli]]. Writing this was
very straightforward and pleasant (I like Brr!).

One issue I have is that the Leaflet map needs to be manipulated very imperatively, whereas the rest of the
application is much more functional. This causes some mismatches. I guess one needs to find a way of hiding the
impressiveness of Leaflet (e.g. like [[https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet][react-leaflet]]).

*** Guix for build and development environments

I use [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] for providing a build and development environment. With guix installed one can
run ~guix shell~ in the GeoPub repository to get a reproducible build environment. All dependencies are fetched and
made available by Guix in this environment (e.g. ~ocaml-xmpp~ or the OCaml compiler).

I will publish ~ocaml-xmpp~ on OPAM once the API is more stable and an initial release can be made.
