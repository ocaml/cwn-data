1) Libraries in functional languages

I have written two pages with all avaible software I know on various
functional languages. Sources are shorly commented, explaining their
principal features and links are given.

- (balanced) binary search trees
- automata and regular expressions

Hope this helps.

I did some things on ipv6 too. I made a patch for the Unix library :

There's getaddrinfo and getnameinfo support and some other things too.

3) Announce: Xcaml 0.0.1 released
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alessandro Baretta announced:

Hello Caml riders!

I'm glad to announce the first public alpha release of the
Xcaml application server for Apache (and other CGI enable
web servers). You can find it at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcaml/

Xcaml is a number of things:

1) An XML flavored programming language.

Xcaml scripts compute a text file, generally an XML or HTML
file. The full power of Ocaml can be unleashed by embedding
ocaml code within <?xcaml ... ?> processing instructions. 
Other features include $-variables, whereby "$varname" gets
substituted with the contents of the "varname" CGI
environment variable); $-expressions, whereby "$( ocaml-expr
)$" is substituted with the string computed by the
ocaml-expr; $#-variables, whereby "$#varname" is substituted
with the contents of the varname session-environment
variable saved within the xcaml application server.

2) An Xcaml -> Ocaml -> Bytecode compiler

Xcaml scripts get translated to Ocaml and subsequently
compiled to bytecode object files.

3) A dynamic application server

Xcaml-derived bytecode object files are dynamically linked
with the xcaml executable to produce the output of the
associated xcaml-script.

Xcaml is currently being used to develop web frontends to
mission critical database applications.

Currently, the main limitation of the Xcaml system is the
total absence of documentation, as the the implementors of
the Xcaml system are also the only users (up to now).

I plan on working on the documentation, but I would first
like to estimate how much interest there is in the ocaml
community for this project.

Of course, contributions and cooperation are more than welcome.

If you happen to miss a cwn, you can send me a message
(alan.schmitt@inria.fr) and I'll mail it to you, or go take a look at
the archive (http://pauillac.inria.fr/~aschmitt/cwn/). If you also wish
to receive it every week by mail, just tell me so.
