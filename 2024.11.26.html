<p>
We have the pleasure of announcing the release of OCaml 5.2.1, dedicated to the
memory of Niels Bohr and Paul Éluard on the anniversary of their deaths.
</p>

<p>
OCaml 5.2.1 is a collection of safe but import runtime time bug fixes backported
from the 5.3 branch of OCaml to improve the stability of the 5.2 runtime while waiting for the
upcoming release of OCaml 5.3.0.
</p>

<p>
The full list of bug fixes is available below for more details.
</p>

<p>
Happy hacking,
Florian Angeletti, for the OCaml team.

<p>
I'm pleased to announce the first preview release for the <a href="https://github.com/chris-armstrong/smaws">smaws</a> library (<code>0.1~preview1</code>).
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="https://github.com/chris-armstrong/smaws">smaws</a></b> provides AWS bindings for OCaml using  the modern <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio">eio</a> library for effects-based concurrency handling.

<h4 id="orga3df4c6">Whats in this release</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga3df4c6">
<p>
This release includes SDKs for some AWS services and is intended to demonstrate its API. 
</p>

<p>
It is not production ready, lacking important features such as full API documentation EC2/ECS instance metadata authentication, retry and timeout handling, etc. It also needs support for the other internal AWS API types to extend coverage across most AWS services.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7fa6641" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7fa6641">Motivation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7fa6641">
<p>
I wanted to build an AWS SDK using modern effects-based concurrency. I've built similar bindings for ReScript and ReasonML in the past (some of the code is in fact ported across) but this is the first OCaml-native bindings I've created. 
</p>

<p>
Unlike similar projects in the OCaml ecosystem, it uses the newer Smithy definitions to generate its bindings instead of the Python botocore definitions. These should be better supported by AWS in the future with richer API definitions.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5b3e361" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5b3e361">What's next</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5b3e361">
<p>
My next task is to finish off API documentation generation, and then expand support for all the authentication methods and other API types that will allow this to be used with most AWS services.

<h3 id="org70033d1">Patrick Ferris announced</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org70033d1">
<p>
I'm happy to announce the release of <code>ppx_deriving_ezjsonm</code> (based off of <a href="https://github.com/patricoferris/ppx_deriving_yaml/">ppx_deriving_yaml</a>). The two libraries share a common definition of a "<code>value</code>" which made the reuse of the existing deriver possible for a simple JSON deriver.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org496c50f">
opam update
opam install ppx_deriving_ezjsonm
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="https://patricoferris.github.io/ppx_deriving_yaml/ppx_deriving_ezjsonm/index.html">documentation is online</a>.
</p>

<p>
This library may come in handy when your dependency cone already includes <code>ezjsonm</code>. If that is not the case, you would probably have better luck in the <code>yojson</code> ecosystem of tools.

<p>
Happy JSON-ing :camel:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f70cd8">
<p>
A few years ago my friend and I started a company called <a href="https://terrateam.io">Terrateam</a>, which does infrastructure orchestration on GitHub.  Being that I am an Ocamler and we are a lean company, we chose to use Ocaml as our primary language.  We recently went open source and I'm posting the link here to contribute an example of an actual company using Ocaml.  A real repository.
</p>

<p>
The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There a few things to note about the repo:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It's a mono repo, so while many of the libraries in there are generic, they are not really individually consumable as is.</li>
<li>We have our own concurrency framework (more on that below).</li>
<li>We use our own build library (pds, which is in opam).</li>
<li>The code is in flux all the time so things change rapidly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Why did we build our own concurrency framework?
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: Yet another concurrency framework? Yep!  Do I expect anyone to use it? Nope, and that's ok.  It is designed for our needs.  It's meant to be maintainable by one person.  It's not meant to compete with Lwt or Async for mind share.  If it grows, great, if it doesn't, I'm happy still.
</p>

<p>
Our concurrency framework is called "Asynchronous Building Blocks" (Abb).  It started over a decade ago when I was frustrated with a few things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I wanted kqueue support in Async, but (at the time) Async required modifying a handful of repos to support it and it just wasn't obvious how.</li>
<li>Lwt supported kqueue, but for no good reason, I just didn't like Lwt.  Part of it was how failure worked in Lwt and other part is just it didn't fit my aesthetic.  That isn't a ding against Lwt, just personal preference.</li>
<li>I wanted as much of it to be implemented in Ocaml as possible.  As it stands now, the only C code is <code>libkqueue</code> which is a little shim to to allow kqueue code to run on Linux, otherwise everything is in Ocaml.</li>
<li>I didn't like how neither Async nor Lwt really supported cancelling operations.  I wanted that to be part of the framework, not an ad-hoc feature per library.  Coming from Erlang, cancelling is really important to me and part of how I think about writing concurrent software.  I was bummed that (last I looked) Eio explicitly rejected cancelling.</li>
<li>I also wanted a little experiment of "what if the concurrency library exposed a syscall interface like an OS?"  So a lot of the interface is meant to look low-level (I don't think this idea really panned out or made Abb meaningfully different).</li>
<li>I also just like having my own frameworks.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Add a dash of naivete, "how hard can it be to build a concurrency framework?", I started my own.  First commit was Mar 9, 2013.
</p>

<p>
Much of the concurrency monad is based on an unreleased library called <code>Fut</code> by @dbuenzli 
</p>

<p>
Over time, Abb matured to where I could use it in my personal projects.  And by the time we decided to make Terrateam, I felt it was good enough for production.  And it's been running production traffic for a few years now.
</p>

<p>
One, unexpected, benefit of Lwt and Async existing in the community is that adding a third one isn't that hard.  Almost all libraries that want to be used support both, and that usually means that they have a generic interface.  Cohttp and Dns are examples.  So I could use existing libraries for things I didn't want to or don't feel I could reasonably implement myself.
</p>

<p>
I've also used Abb as a foundation my web framework called Brtl (pronounced Brutal) which is both a backend framework build on Cohttp and a frontend framework built on Brr.  It really doesn't do anything fancy, like Dream, it's pretty low level and focused on being simple.
</p>

<p>
The good:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It works!  At least, for me.</li>
<li>Given that I wrote very single line of code, debugging and bug fixing (which is less and less) is very easy.  I also have a really great mental model of how it works.</li>
<li>I like that I can just cancel a whole graph of async work if it's no longer needed.</li>
<li>The future's library works in FreeBSD, Linux, and JavaScript.</li>
<li>The test coverage is pretty darn high.  This is because it's a pretty intricate thing to implement so I had to implement a lot of tests to stay sane.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The bad:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Performance is not anything special.  I don't think this is a fundamental flaw, it's just that it is as fast as I need it to be right now.</li>
<li>Some of the API is a awkward if you don't know the system.  Or names are long, like <code>Abb_future_combinators</code>.</li>
<li>The multi-target build story kind of sucks.  I think that might be a bigger issue with the pds build system but for now in the web framework you have to use <code>Abb_js</code> rather than <code>Abb</code> for everything.</li>
<li>There are definitely some corners cut in, especially around file IO, but that's OK, we don't do much file IO.</li>
<li>Explicitly takes advantage in that everything runs in a single thread.  So implicitly going multi-threaded would probably break things.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Future work:
</p>

<p>
There really isn't a lot of future work.  For the most part: Abb is done.  Or should I say the interface is done.  Yes, it will need updates to fight bit rot, but there isn't much more for it to do.  It runs your code concurrently, the end.
</p>

<p>
However, as Ocaml5 becomes more of a thing, it will need to take advantage of that.  I haven't really thought about how to do it.  One item I have in my to-do list is to evaluate if Picos could be a base layer for Abb.  Abb is a layered approach so really you only need to implement the <code>Abb_intf.S</code> interface and everything above that should Just Work (given single threaded semantics).  I think any future work to support multi core will probably need an explicit "this crosses a thread boundary" API.  Abb will get there, eventually, but right now it doesn't need to.
</p>

<p>
Effects will obviously have a big impact, I have no idea what that'll do for Abb.  I hope I can transition it slowly to supporting effects but I don't want to look at effects until it's in the type system.
</p>

<p>
Some, perhaps, libraries of interest in the repo:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/abb_scheduler_kqueue">Abb_scheduler_kqueue</a> - The most used scheduler.  It implements the <a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/abb_intf">Abb_intf</a> interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/abb_scheduler_select">Abb_scheduler_select</a> - A simpler select-based scheduler.  This is meant to be used any place kqueue is not supported and also as demo.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/pgsql_io">Pgsql_io</a> - An implementation of the PostgreSQL protocol.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/githubc2">Githubc2</a> - An automatically generated GitHub REST library generated from their JSON Schema.  This actually has no Abb dependency, just implements the API serializing/deserializing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/tree/main/code/src/openapi_cli">OpenAPI CLI</a> - This generates a library (see Githubc2) from an OpenAPI spec.  It is, absolutely, a bit of a rats nest, but it works.  We chose to do code-gen for this because I didn't want to be blocked when compiling based on different compiler versions as we're using <code>Ast_helper</code>.  Ocaml, the code, is more stable than Ocaml, the compiler API.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is a bunch of other stuff in there.  If you decide to poke around and have any questions, feel free to ask.  I can promise: not every decision in there is well thought out or coherent.

<b>Snapshottable Stores &#x2013; Clément Allain &amp; Gabriel Scherer (@gasche)</b>
</p>

<p>
We say that an imperative data structure is <b>snapshottable</b> or <b>supports snapshots</b> if we can efficiently capture its current state, and restore a previously captured state to become the current state again. This is useful, for example, to implement backtracking search processes that update the data structure during search.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by a data structure proposed in 1978 by Baker, we present a <b>snapshottable store</b>, a bag of mutable references that supports snapshots. Instead of capturing and restoring an array, we can capture an arbitrary set of references (of any type) and restore all of them at once. This snapshottable store can be used as a building block to support snapshots for arbitrary data structures, by simply replacing all mutable references in the data structure by our store references. We present use-cases of a snapshottable store when implementing type-checkers and automated theorem provers.
</p>

<p>
Our implementation is designed to provide a very low overhead over normal references, in the common case where the capture/restore operations are infrequent. Read and write in store references are essentially as fast as in plain references in most situations, thanks to a key optimisation we call <b>record elision</b>. In comparison, the common approach of replacing references by integer indices into a persistent map incurs a logarithmic overhead on reads and writes, and sophisticated algorithms typically impose much larger constant factors.
</p>

<p>
The implementation, which is inspired by Baker's and the OCaml implementation of persistent arrays by Conchon and Filliâtre, is both fairly short and very hard to understand: it relies on shared mutable state in subtle ways. We provide a mechanized proof of correctness of its core using the Iris framework for the Coq proof assistant.

<b>Safe, expressive and efficient programming of FPGAs circuits &#x2013; Loïc Sylvestre</b>
</p>

<p>
FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are reconfigurable digital circuits: their behavior can be customized by logic synthesis of specification at the so-called register transfer level (RT level), in hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. FPGAs are well suited to implement reactive systems, directly as synchronous circuits interacting with the external environment via I/O pins – the logic synthesizer ensuring that timing constraints are met, given the FPGA clock frequency. FPGAs are also used to implement hardware accelerators ; however, RT-level descriptions of transformational systems (or “computations”) – with latencies of several clock cycles – are difficult to debug, maintain and manually optimize. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) offers a simpler way of expressing computations, using a programming language compiled at the RT level. The advantage of this approach is to keep the implementation details hidden from the programmer, leaving the compiler responsible for scheduling computations over time. However, this leads to a loss of control over temporal behavior and therefore safety and efficiency for the circuits generated. As embedded systems, especially those based on FPGAs, need to perform more and more computations, while interacting with their environment, this thesis proposes a programming model to combine hardware description (data-flow oriented) and general-purpose parallel computation (control-flow oriented) using a synchronous approach. This programming model forms the basis for the design and implementation of Eclat, a functional-imperative, parallel and synchronous programming language, compiled to VHDL. Eclat is sufficiently precise to describe synchronous circuits at the RT level. It facilitates the programming of hardware accelerators, with a clear and predictable temporal semantics by which to exploit time-space trade-offs. Any Eclat program is reactive, with a mechanism for embedding computations within programs and thereby mix computation and interaction. Eclat also offers shared memory (in the form of RAM blocks), with deterministic concurrency. It is used to develop programming abstractions such as algorithmic skeletons and virtual machine implementations for high-level languages. This addresses, at various levels, the need to run general-purpose algorithms within FPGA-based reactive embedded applications.
