OCaml 4.05.0 :
--------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

### Code generation and optimizations:

- MPR#7201, GPR#954: Correct wrong optimisation of "0 / <expr>"
  and "0 mod <expr>" in the case when <expr> was a non-constant
  evaluating to zero
  (Mark Shinwell)

- MPR#7357, GPR#832: Improve compilation time for toplevel
  include(struct ... end : sig ... end)
  (Alain Frisch, report by Hongbo Zhang, review by Jacques Garrigue)

- GPR#504: Instrumentation support for fuzzing with afl-fuzz.
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Alain Frisch, Pierre Chambart, Mark
  Shinwell, Gabriel Scherer and Damien Doligez)

- GPR#863, GPR#1068, GPR#1069: Optimise matches with constant
  results to lookup tables.
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Gabriel Scherer, Pierre Chambart,
  Mark Shinwell, and bug report by Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#1150: Fix typo in arm64 assembler directives
  (KC Sivaramakrishnan)

  `void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}_value(value msg)`
  in addition to
  `void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}(char const *msg)`.
  The previous functions would not free their message argument, so
  were inconvient for dynamically-allocated messages; the messages
  passed to the new functions are handled by the garbage collector.
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Mark Shinwell, request by Immanuel Litzroth)

- PR#7557, GPR#1213: More security for getenv
  (Damien Doligez, reports by Seth Arnold and Eric Milliken, review by

  User programs may implement similar options using the new `Expand`
  constructor of the `Arg` module.
  (Bernhard Schommer, review by Jérémie Dimino, Gabriel Scherer
   and Damien Doligez, discussion with Alain Frisch and Xavier Leroy,

  support profiling with gprof; dummy profiling libraries are no longer
  installed on such platforms.
  This can be tested with ocamlopt -config
  (Sébastien Hinderer)

- GPR#1009: "ocamlc -c -linkall" and "ocamlopt -c -linkall" can now be used
  to set the "always link" flag on individual compilation units.  This
  controls linking with finer granularity than "-a -linkall", which sets
  the "always link" flag on all units of the given library.
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1015: add option "-plugin PLUGIN" to ocamldep too. Use compilerlibs
  to build ocamldep.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#916: new tool lintapidiff, use it to update the manual with
  @since annotations for API changes introduced between 4.00-4.05.
  (Edwin Török, review by Gabriel Scherer, discussion with Alain Frisch,
   David Allsopp, Sébastien Hinderer, Damien Doligez and Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#939: activate the caml_example environment in the language
  extensions section of the manual. Convert some existing code

  (Florian Angeletti)

- GPR#1082: clarify that the use of quoted string for preprocessed
  foreign quotations still requires the use of an extension node
  [%foo ...] to mark non-standard interpretation.
  (Gabriel Scherer, request by Matthew Wahab in GPR#1066,
   review by Florian Angeletti)

  (Gabriel Scherer and Gabriel Radanne, review by David Allsopp,
  inspired by John Whitington)

### Other libraries:

  (Jonathan Protzenko)

- GPR#650: in the Unix library, add `?cloexec:bool` optional arguments to
  functions that create file descriptors (`dup`, `dup2`, `pipe`, `socket`,
  `socketpair`, `accept`).  Implement these optional arguments in the
  most atomic manner provided by the operating system to set (or clear)
  the close-on-exec flag at the same time the file descriptor is created,
  reducing the risk of race conditions with `exec` or `create_process`
  calls running in other threads, and improving security.  Also: add a
  `O_KEEPEXEC` flag for `openfile` by symmetry with `O_CLOEXEC`.

### Compiler distribution build system: Makefile factorization

The compiler distribution build system (the set of Makefiles used to
build the compiler distribution) traditionally had separate Makefiles
for Unix and Windows, which lead to some amount of duplication and
subtle differences and technical debt in general -- for people working
on the compiler distribution, but also cross-compilation or porting to
new systems. During the 4.05 development period, Sébastien Hinderer
worked on harmonizing the build rules and merging the two build
systems.

* Some changes were made to the config/Makefile file which
  is exported as $(ocamlc -where)/Makefile.config, and on
  which some advanced users might rely. The changes are
  as follows:
  - a BYTERUN variable was added that points to the installed ocamlrun
  - the PARTIALLD variable was removed (PACKLD is more complete)
  - the always-empty DLLCCCOMPOPTS was removed
  - the SHARED variable was removed; its value is "shared" or "noshared",
    which duplicates the existing and more convenient
    SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBRARIES variable whose value is "true" or "false".

  Note that Makefile.config may change further in the future and relying
  on it is a bit fragile. We plan to make `ocamlc -config` easier to use
  for scripting purposes, and have a stable interface there. If you rely
  on Makefile.config, you may want to get in touch with Sébastien Hinderer
  or participate to MPR#7116 (Allow easy retrieval of Makefile.config's values)
  or MPR#7172 (More information in ocamlc -config).

2) Intel Skylake / Kaby Lake hardware bug affects OCaml programs
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-06/msg00118.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Xavier Leroy announced:

It was recently made public that Intel processors of the Skylake and Kaby Lake
families have a nasty hardware bug concerning hyperthreading. See, for example
<https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/skylake-kaby-lake-chips-have-a-crash-bug-with-hyperthreading-enabled/>

I wanted to draw the attention of all OCaml users to this issue, because this
hardware bug is triggered by the OCaml runtime under fairly common conditions.
Random crashes caused by this bug were observed at Ahrefs and another industrial
user of OCaml, and also by users of Coccinelle and of Coq. (*)

Your OCaml installation may be affected if the following three conditions are met:

1- You're using an Intel processor of the Skylake or Kaby Lake family.
   (AMD processors and older Intel processors are not affected.)
   
2- The processor support hyperthreading (HT) and hyperthreading is enabled in
   the BIOS.

3- The OCaml runtime system was compiled with certain versions of GCC.
   (We don't know exactly which versions of GCC triggers the issue, but
    it seems that it is never triggered by clang-generated code.
    In particular, this means that Mac OS X users should be safe.)

See <https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/06/msg00308.html> for help in
determining if your processor is vulnerable, and for instructions on how to
address the issue. Possible fixes include:

- Apply the microcode update recently released by Intel for Skylake processors.
(No such update exists yet for Kaby Lake processors.)
- Disable hyperthreading in the BIOS.
- Reinstall OCaml using clang instead of GCC.

Kind regards,

- Xavier Leroy

(*) It is likely that we OCaml folks were the first to pinpoint this Intel bug.
For more information, see the narratives at
<https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7452>
<https://medium.com/ahrefs/skylake-bug-a-detective-story-ab1ad2beddcd>
      
** Xavier Leroy then added:

Clarification:

> Possible fixes include:
> 
> - Apply the microcode update recently released by Intel [...]

Contradicting what I wrote before, microcode updates are available both for
Skylake and for Kaby Lake processors. It's only how to apply those updates that
differs slightly between Skylake and Kaby Lake. Again, see the excellent
instructions at
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/06/msg00308.html>

Sorry for the confusion.
      
** Gabriel Scherer then said:

Here is my list of affected OCaml projects known so far (it seems
surprisingly less rare than I thought at first):

- an (unnamed) industrial user noticed the issue in Spring 2016, as
  reported by Xavier on the bugtracker:
  <https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7452#c17109>

- ahrefs noticed issues in late 2016, as reported by Joris
  Giovannangeli on the bugtracker issue or his longer piece
  <https://tech.ahrefs.com/skylake-bug-a-detective-story-ab1ad2beddcd>

- Lwt users were also affected (first report from Sebastien Mondet in
  February 2017):
  <https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/315>

- Julia Lawall reported segfaults from a downstream user on the caml-list,
  that seem extreley likely to be related to this issue (they
  disappear with hyperthreading disabled)
  <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2017-06/msg00115.html>

At this point it seems reasonable to assume that any
computation-intensive OCaml program that is run in parallel may be
affected.
      
** Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias also added:
