      <cwn_title>mlfront-shell - reference implementation of a build system</cwn_title>

I’ve made a reference implementation (“mlfront-shell”) of a build system that is mostly working but has zero (0) performance work so far. Among the many existing build + package managers, the “mlfront-shell” tool sits closest to Nix. It works on Windows, can download binary assets, is language-neutral with an easy-to-parse JSON build file.

The reference implementation comes with a specification doc and a JSON schema. Since I’ll eventually be integrating the build system features into ~dk~ (my OCaml scripting tool), the docs live there. You’ll find a Quick Start guide and a Comparison table (the ~opam~ and ~dune~ comparisons are pertinent):

Huge thanks to the a la carte authors, and also to @hbr for [fmlib_parse](https://ocaml.org/p/fmlib_parse/latest).

      <cwn_title>An experimental branch of Merlin based on Domains and Effects</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-an-experimental-branch-of-merlin-based-on-domains-and-effects/17195/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Xavier Van de Woestyne announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
/The Merlin Team/ :man_mage:  is very happy to announce an experimental version of Merlin: [Merlin Domains](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/tree/merlin-domains)!

As a reminder, [Merlin](https://ocaml.github.io/merlin/) is an /editor service/ that provides advanced IDE features for OCaml. It can be used as a standalone binary or as a library, and is notably used by [OCaml LSP Server](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp). In other words, if you are using the [OCaml Platform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform) with Visual Studio Code, or [ocaml-eglot](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot) with Emacs, you are already using Merlin *under the hood*.

Even though over the years we’ve had relatively few complaints about Merlin’s performance, in some contexts (notably very large /files/), Merlin’s mechanism (~parsing file~ (with recovery) -> ~typing file~ (with recovery) -> ~performing analysis~) could sometimes cause slowdowns!

To address these slowdowns, we started an experimental branch that uses [domains](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/api/Domain.html) and [effects](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.3/effects.html), which allow us *to interrupt the typing process at the right moment* when an analysis request comes in.

In practice, let’s say you run an analysis command on a very large file: *the type-checker will progress up to the location that makes the analysis possible, run the analysis phase, return the result, and then continue typing the file*. This separation is possible thanks to control flow management enabled by effects, and by having two domains interact with each other.

In practice, this makes the analysis phases much more efficient! We think this is a great example of migrating a regular OCaml application to one that takes advantage of multicore. For a more technical explanation of *how this experimental branch works internally*, @pitag and @Lyrm  will talk about it at [Lambda World](https://lambda.world/), in their talk [When magic meets multicore - OCaml and its elegant era of parallelism](https://lambda.world/speakers/?speaker=Sonja%20Heinze).

Currently, the branch is still in its incubation phase, and *we’d be delighted to get your feedback*!

*** How to test the branch

To avoid installing this version of ~merlin~ unintentionally, we suggest /pinning/ this branch in the switches where you want to experiment with this new version (compatible with Merlin’s ~main~):

#+begin_example
opam pin add https://github.com/ocaml/merlin#merlin-domains
#+end_example

Although this experimental branch passes the /test-suite/, *your feedback is very important* to help collect potential bugs we may have missed.
We’ve added a ~Bug/Merlin-domains~ label to organize tickets related to this experimental branch.

*** Next steps

In the future, the goal of this branch (which will be regularly rebased on ~main~) is to *become the main branch*, so that all users can benefit from these improvements.
At the same time, the rest of the ecosystem depending on Merlin (such as the *OCaml LSP Server*) will be adapted to also take full advantage of these new features!


/Happy Hacking!/

I recently implemented a database connection using caqti last 2 weeks and wrote a blog about it.
Here it is, https://fearful-odds.rocks/blog/postgres-caqti-pooling-ocaml-2025/

I would like to listen to your feedback or comments regarding my approach.
Cheers
