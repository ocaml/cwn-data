1) perl4caml 0.3.0 - Call Perl libraries from OCaml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Richard Jones announced:

I'm pleased to announce the first working release of perl4caml
(0.3.0).  This small wrapper allows you to call Perl libraries from
Objective CAML programs.

There is a low-level interface which allows you to call or evaluate
Perl directly, and there are high-level object-oriented interfaces to
some CPAN libraries.  Currently I have wrapped libwww-perl
(LWP::UserAgent), HTTP::* and the Google API (Net::Google), because
these are what I'm using.  I hope that other people can contribute
high-level wrappers to any Perl libraries they might find useful -
wrappers are quite easy to write.

Perl4caml is distributed under GNU LGPL with the OCaml linking
exception.

2) Weird behavior with nan's and min/max
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yaron Minsky asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; Now here's the weird bit.  I decided I wanted a polymorphic comparison
&gt; that wouldn't have this problem.  But this is a little harder than it
&gt; seems, since it turns out that specialized float version of equality is
&gt; different from the polymorphic version.

Yes, it's a long-standing bug for which we haven't yet a good
solution.  More exactly, there are two problematic solutions:

1- Fix polymorphic equality so that it behaves like IEEE equality on floats,
i.e. it always returns false when one of its arguments is NaN.
The problem is that this breaks the implication
        x == y  imply  x = y
and thus the current implementation of polymorphic equality needs to
be made less efficient.  Currently, x = y starts by testing x == y
and returns true if the pointer equality holds.  But this could be the
wrong result according to the new specification, since x can contain
an NaN somewhere.  Hence, polymorphic equality would have to traverse
its two arguments even when they are physically the same.  The
performance impact of this change on real programs is unknown.

2- As J M Skaller proposed, change the behavior of polymorphic
equality and its version specialized to floats so that nan = nan
and nan &lt;&gt; x if x &lt;&gt; nan.  Similar changes need to be done on the
&lt;&gt;, &lt;= and &gt;= tests for consistency.  IEEE comparisons would then have to be
provided as separate primitives.  This preserves the implication
x == y ==&gt; x = y.  But the machine code generated for =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=
over floats will have to be a lot less efficient than it is now, since
all processors implement float comparisons as per IEEE.

Coming back to your proposed workaround:

&gt; # let raw_min = min
&gt; val raw_min : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
&gt; # let min x y =
&gt;   if not (y = y) then y
&gt;   else if not (x = x) then x
&gt;   else raw_min x y
&gt; ;;

A way to make this work would be to replace the "not (x = x)" tests
by calls to the following function (of type 'a -&gt; bool):

let is_obj_nan x =
  Obj.tag (Obj.repr x) = Obj.double_tag &amp;&amp;
  (let f = (Obj.magic x : float) in not (f = f))

Not pretty, I agree.

** Following a long discussion, Yaron Minsky asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; &gt; Doesn't the polymorphic comparison have to be a total order?

Pervasive.compare must be a total order, so it would need to throw an
exception if its arguments are unordered (e.g. one is "nan").
The other comparisons (=, &lt;, etc) could implement a partial order,
returning "false" in the "unordered" case (except for &lt;&gt;, which should
return "true" in this case).

&gt; This kind of wigs me out too.  For example, do the set and map data
&gt; structures depend on this total order property?  What happens when I
&gt; stick in a data structure which contains some floats somewhere in it,
&gt; and some of those floats are nan's?  Does the data structure continue to
&gt; work at all?  It totally wigs me out.

Sets and maps require a total order, so, yes, in the current
implementation, strange things can happen with "nan" used as set
elements or map keys.  Again, throwing an "unordered" exception in
Pervasives.compare would avoid the problem.

Note, however, that it doesn't make much sense to use floats as set
elements or map keys, due to the inherently approximate nature of floats.
E.g. does the set {1.0; 1.0+.epsilon} have 1 or 2 elements?

&gt; I wish there was some sensible way around it.  Probably the thing I
&gt; would like best is for calculations that produce nans to throw
&gt; exceptions.  But from what I've heard so far, this doesn't appear to be
&gt; possible.

The IEEE standard specifies both behaviors: return nan or cause a
floating-point trap, and says that there should be an API to choose
the desired behavior.  Most processors implement the two behaviors,
controlled by some status bit somewhere.

The first problem is that there is no standard C API to select the
desired behavior (even ISO C 99 isn't terribly clear on this).  So,
everyone stays in the "nans, no traps" mode.

&gt; Here's another question:  is it possible to catch floating point
&gt; exceptions such as division by zero?  It seems like that might be another
&gt; way of dealing with this.  I thought catching SIGFPE would do it, but I
&gt; tried and I couldn't seem to get it triggered.  Is it possible to convert
&gt; floating point exceptions to ocaml exceptions?

That's the second problem.  Trapping a synchronous signal (such as
SIGFPE) and turning it into a Caml exception is quite hard and
non-portable.  Caml manages to deal with asynchronous signals by
delaying their delivery until a safe point is reached, but obviously
this doesn't work for synchronous, program-generated signals.
E.g. what to do if the SIGFPE comes from C code running in "blocking
section" mode?

3) ViM support for ocamldebug
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Stefano Zacchiroli announced:

I failed in learning the few emacs keybindgs I need in order to use
ocamldebug under emacs ... Needing a handy front end for ocamldebug for
a poor vimer in emacsists world :), I've written a small tool that
permits to use ocamldebug with gvim.

It's available, for feedback, bug reports, and contributions, here:

4) a patch to support + and * in ocamlyacc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Andrew Lenharth announced:

I find myself having to often implement rules such as:

foo_plus: foo {[$1]} | foo foo_plus {$1::$2} ;
foo_star: foo_plus {$1} | {[]} ;

in my parsers.  To get rid of this annoyance, here
is a patch that add support for * and + to ocamlyacc.

<a href="http://vilya.homelinux.net/~andrewl/ocamlyacc_p1.diff">http://vilya.homelinux.net/~andrewl/ocamlyacc_p1.diff</a>

it is a bit hackish, but even limited support for * and + makes
writting grammers less painful.

I modify get_name to check for + and *, and rewrite the name
it finds if those exist.  It also adds appropriate rules to a
buffer to implement the rewritten name.  I change the read character
rutine such that at EOF I switch to the buffer holding the generated
rules.  This has been tested not to break the bootstrapping system.

An example:

%token &lt;int&gt; INT_LITERAL
%token EOF

%start main /* entry point */
%type &lt;int list&gt; main

%%
main:
  INT_LITERAL+ EOF {$1}
  ;

5) ipv6, any news?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Yaron M. Minsky asked and Xavier Leroy answered:

&gt; I'm wondering if there's any news on the ipv6 front.  I understand that
&gt; 3.07 has no support in it.  I've been getting some complaints from users
&gt; of my software looking for IPv6, and I'm wondering what other people are
&gt; doing to provide such support.

No IPv6 support yet.  It would be a worthwhile addition, but I admit
to have no familiarity with the IPv6 API.  I got the impression that there
are some variations on the IPv6 API among Unix systems, which would be
a pain, but I may be wrong.

** Francois Rouaix added:

Back in 1997 or so, Francis Dupont wrote a layer of C to interface IPv6
calls to Caml. IIRC, the OCaml API was mostly unchanged (compared to
usual Unix network API), and hence a few of the network apps we had in
those days (especially MMM and the V6 proxy) were then used
(essentially as-is) in IPv6 interoperability tests on FreeBSD.
Maybe Francis still has some code in a drawer :
Francis.Dupont@enst-bretagne.fr
Otherwise, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mmm+ipv6&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">http://www.google.com/search?q=mmm+ipv6&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a>
might get you enough pieces to put it back together...

** Gregoire Henry also added:

I've make some works this summer, trying to respect basic sockets RFC.
It's based on Unix module from ocaml-3.06.

<a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~henry/ip6/socket6-20031020.tgz">http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~henry/ip6/socket6-20031020.tgz</a>

it's early works, but feedbacks would be nice.

&gt; I got the impression that there are some variations on the IPv6 API among 
&gt; Unix systems, which would be a pain, but I may be wrong.

Basic API is now a standard, and i've test on FreeBSD and Linux.
Indeed, i can see some differences in constant for socket options
and DNS request :
some are not defined on linux.

** Olivier Andrieu replied to Gregoire Henry:

I did some of this too : <a href="http://oandrieu.nerim.net/ocaml/#ipv6">http://oandrieu.nerim.net/ocaml/#ipv6</a> .

I noticed you used a inet6_addr type for addresses. It's possible to
reuse the inet_addr type and have the C code discriminate between the
two by the string length. That way the sockaddr type wouldn't need to
be extended. But then you can't specify the flowinfo field (and I
don't know how to support it in this case).

Using folding to read the cwn in vim 6+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a quick trick to help you read this CWN if you are viewing it using
vim (version 6 or greater).

:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^=\\{78}$'?'&lt;1':1
zM

If you know of a better way, please let me know.
