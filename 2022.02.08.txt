pyml_bindgen: a CLI app to generate Python bindings directly from OCaml value specifications

New version
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  I wanted to announce a new version of `pyml_bindgen' has been merged
  into the opam repository, version 0.2.0.  Whenever it hits, feel free
  to try it out!

  The main addition is now you can embed Python files directly into the
  generated OCaml module and it will be evaluated at run time.  In this
  way, you don't need your users to mess with the `PYTHONPATH'
  environment variable or need them to install a particular Python
  module when using the generated OCaml code. (Another thanks to
  UnixJunkie and Thierry Martinez for their help with this!)

  There were also a few bugfixes and some nice new [examples] added to
  the GitHub repository.  One cool thing about the examples is that they
  show you how to set up your project to use Dune rules to automatically
  generate Python bindings whenever the value specification files
  change!
