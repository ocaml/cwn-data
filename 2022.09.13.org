* Caqti 1.9.0 and Plans for 2.0.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 1
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-caqti-1-9-0-and-plans-for-2-0-0/10448/1

** Petter A. Urkedal announced


First I would like to announce the 1.9.0 minor release, see the release notes below for details.

There is also ongoing work in the [[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti/tree/caqti2][caqti2 branch]] targeted for
the next major release.  If someone have an opinion on directions, we can discuss it here, or in the issue tracker
([[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti/issues/90][meta-issue]]), see my brief notes below.

I will attend parts of the ICFP 2022 virtually next week so there may be time to discuss over audio.

*** Release Notes for 1.9.0

New features:

  - Allow unquoted semicolons in query strings in the new API.  There are
    corner cases where it is needed, as reported in issue #87, and a parser
    which rejects semicolons are still available for loading schema files
    statement by statement.

  - Add support for MySQL and MariaDB configuration files, as a solution to
    issue #86.

  - Add a limit to the number of times a database connection is reused when
    pooling connections (#94).  Thanks to Peter Mondlock for investigating
    resource usage server side motivating this addition.

  - Provide access to the raw SQLite3 connection handle for the purpose of
    defining custom functions (#56).

Fixes:

  - Add missing dune dependency on unix (GPR#85 by David Allsopp).

  - Documentation fixes (GPR#82, GPR#83, GPR#84 by Reynir Bj√∂rnsson,
    GPR#88 by Jonathan Duarte, and GPR#92 by Jim Tittsler).

Deprecations:

  - ~Caqti_type.field~ was deprecated in favour of ~Caqti_type.Field.t~.

Other:

  - Replace deprecated core_kernel dependency with core.

*** Notes on 2.0.0 Development

The main addition is pgx and mirage support.  It is already functional, but not very useful for production, since it
lacks TLS.  The trick here is that PostgreSQL uses STARTTLS, so we can't use conduit-lwt as-is.

Another thing in progress, but unpublished, is [[https://github.com/paurkedal/ocaml-caqti/issues/89][per-connection configuration]].  Up till now, configuration has only been
possible through the connection URL or behind-the-scene via C libraries (now also for MariaDB).  However, this will
no longer be practical for delivering CA certificates to pgx.  Two design issues which you may have an opinion
about:

  - Driver specific options can be defined in the ~caqti~ package or in ~caqti-driver-*~ packages. In the former case, the configuration can be manipulated without depending on specific drivers, but the downside is that we will pull in dependencies on ~x509~, ~domain-name~, ~ipaddr~ and possibly ~tls~ and ~sexplib0~.
  - My current sketch provides sexp-serialisation, a choice mainly motivated by the availability of such serialization for client configuration of ~tls~, but I hope to find a more generic solution which allows easy embedding of Caqti configuration in application configuration independent of which format is used.

An example of how an sexp-formatted configuration might look like:
#+begin_example
(connection
 (pool
  (max-use-count 20)
  (max-idle-size 10))
 (driver postgresql)
 (endpoints
  (inet pg1.example.org)
  (inet pg2.example.org))
 (target-session-attrs read-write))
#+end_example
where the ~(pool ...)~ clause is driver-indepnedent and the ~(driver ...)~ clause determines which DB-specific
options are valid. In the current draft, order does not matter despite this dependency.

(I could also mention plans of wrapping modules, but this will be done first as a forward-compatible module in
parallel to the current modules preferably at the beginning of a major release cycle.  The reason I haven't written
that main ~Caqti~ module yet, is that I would like to take the opportunity to tidy up the namespace to make it
easier for newcomers to discover the main entry points.)

** Moazzam Moriani announced


I, along with Jay, were the two [[https://www.outreachy.org/][Outreachy]] interns working with the OCaml :camel:
community  this summer. I worked on [[https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark][Multicore Applications]] and Jay on
[[https://github.com/geocaml/ocaml-topojson][TopoJSON]]. Our internship, of course, was only made possible because
@sudha and @patricoferris generously chose to volunteer to mentor us--as our respective mentors--throughout the
summer. We are grateful to the both of them :heart:.

Our three-month long Outreachy internship just ended relatively recently and, personally, I have really enjoyed
working on my project and learning OCaml. So much so that Jay and I would like to share our experiences with the
rest of the community. :sparkles:

To carry forward a tradition established by the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/friday-03-04-intern-presentations-open-attendance/9429][previous Outreachy
cohort]], we will host a virtual
session that will consist of two short presentations from the both of us followed by a Q&A. The session will be on
Friday 23rd September 2-3pm CET.

It is open to whoever wishes to join. A recording will be shared later online as well.

We hope you will join us! :raised_hands:

* MirageOS for B2B SaaS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/mirageos-for-b2b-saas/10454/1

** Volodymyr Melnyk asked


I have an idea to build a SaaS for corporate blogging (like Medium, but for companies) and I want to try MirageOS as
a total platform for services. I have no production experience with OCaml (only Golang, JS, Ruby) and have no
experience with MirageOS and unikernels (only Docker, Linux, and a little bit k8s), but I'm very interested in both.
Could you please help me to clarify possible issues with such an approach?

Also I'm interested about a hosting for MirageOS services. I don't like containers and k8s stuff and I prefer
dedicated and virtual servers instead of cloud stuff because I have no resources to pay up to 5x more for hosting.

Thank you for your help!
      

** Calascibetta Romain replied


Thank you for your interest in MirageOS. MirageOS is first and foremost a framework for creating an application
(such as a blog) for several targets. One of these targets is [[https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/][Solo5]] which allows
to create an entire system which includes everything necessary for OCaml (its runtime). Thus, one can deploy a
MirageOS application on:
- KVM (with the target ~hvt~)
- [[https://xenproject.org/][Xen]]
- or produce a simple executable taking advantage of [[https://code.google.com/archive/p/seccompsandbox/wikis/overview.wiki][seccomp]] (and thus finely controlling access to the executable).
- we can also mention the experimental target for [[https://github.com/dinosaure/gilbraltar/][Raspberry Pi 4]]

The objective of MirageOS is to make the choice of targets transparent to the application. This means that for a
given application, deploying for KVM or Xen should not be an upstream choice (which would govern the development of
the application) but the last of the choices which can, of course, be left to third party users.

This reverses the development logic of an application thanks to abstraction mechanisms (specific to OCaml) (the
[[https://ocaml.org/docs/functors][functors]]) that allow to get rid of any specialisation to a given system (Solo5,
Unix, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

This is of course the theory and in practice, it works quite well :) .

To take the example of the blog, you can see [[https://hannes.nqsb.io/][Hannes' blog]] or [[https://blog.osau.re][mine]]
which runs on MirageOS (KVM). The latter have a similar architecture: a unikernel managing TLS certificates and
redirecting HTTP connections to unikernels on a local network ([[https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel][tlstunnel]] or
[[https://github.com/dinosaure/contruno][contruno]]) and a unikernel ([[https://github.com/roburio/unipi][unipi]]) that
only transmits what appears in a Git repository via the HTTP protocol (http/1.1 and h2).

Deployment depends of course on what you have. Regarding KVM, you can follow the tutorials
[[https://robur.coop/Projects/Reproducible_builds][here]] (quite general) and
[[https://blog.osau.re/articles/blog_requiem.html][there]]. You can deploy your unikernels on Google Cloud with this
(probably a bit old) [[https://github.com/aantron/dream/tree/master/example/w-mirage][tutorial]]. Finally, a
deployment with seccomp is possible, it is a simple executable.

Of course, most of these unikernels are already available for download [[https://builds.robur.coop/][here]] thanks to
the excellent work of [[https://robur.io/][robur.io]]. It is ensured that the generated image is reproducible
regardless of the context.

There is of course a whole series of unikernels made by the community that you can mainly find on GitHub. We can
talk about several services like [[https://github.com/roburio/dns-primary-git][DNS]] or
[[https://mirage.io/blog/2022-04-01-Mr-MIME][emails]].

I would like to specify that all this is still experimental. We are gradually reaching the stage where our
unikernels are used in production domains, but it still requires a lot of work and a lot of skills for such a small
team :) . Of course, we are open to everyone's participation and we are especially here to help newcomers.

* Acme plumbing rules for OCaml
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/acme-plumbing-rules-for-ocaml/10467/1

** David A. Arroyo announced


I am sure that the intersection of OCaml users and [[https://acme.cat-v.org/][Acme]] users is small, but I have reason
to believe it is a non-zero set :) . For those of you using this spartan editor, here are some plumbing rules that I
use that allow me to right-click on error messages returned by the OCaml compilers, and jump to the referenced
location in acme:

#+begin_example
# example: in file "foo/bar.ml", line 155, characters 30-62
type	is	text
data	matches	'.*[Ff]ile "([^"]+)", line ([0-9]+), characters ([0-9]+)-([0-9]+).*'$nl'?'
arg	isfile	$1
data	set	$file
attr	add	addr=$2-#0+#$3,$2-#0+#$4
plumb	to	edit
plumb	client	$editor

# example: File "tests/dune", line 2, characters 7-22:
type	is	text
data	matches	'.*[Ff]ile "([^"]+)", lines ([0-9]+)-([0-9]+).*'$nl'?'
arg	isfile	$1
data	set	$file
attr	add	addr=$2,$3
plumb	to	edit
plumb	client	$editor
#+end_example

It could probably be extended to search ~~/.opam~ so you could plumb errors in files outside of your project, but I
do not use opam, so I haven't needed to do it.

Here is a short demo of its use: https://youtu.be/Evl-N0oNNd0

It's not in OCaml, but I also wrote https://github.com/droyo/acme-autoformat and put an ~OcamlFmt~ script in
acme's $PATH like so:

#+begin_example
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/acme-autoformat -r '\.mli?$' \
	-- ocamlformat --name='{{.Basename}}' --enable-outside-detected-project -
#+end_example

This calls ~ocamlformat~ whenever I Put an .ml[i] file. This is probably obviated by combining acme-lsp and
ocaml-lsp, but these two bits work well enough that I haven't felt a need to pursue it.
