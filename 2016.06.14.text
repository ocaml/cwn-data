Have you looked at the dynlink module?

As far as I know it can load only object files so you would have to
compile your .ml file before. Not sure there is a better alternative.
      
** Mark Bradley also suggested:

You can try ocaml_plugin (also uses dynlink but will compile the .ml file before
loading, I've also never tried it from the OCaml repl):

2) omake-0.10.0-test2
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-06/msg00026.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Gerd Stolpmann announced:

there is a new test release of omake. It includes all the developments
since I started taking omake over last year, in particular:

 - omake got faster for large projects (this part of the work was
   funded by Lexifi)
 - there is a new bootstrap system that unifies Unix and Windows
 - it now also works with the MinGW port
 - a couple of bugs were fixed

This is a test release. In particular, it would be good to know whether
the new bootstrap works everywhere, and whether I package omake up
correctly.

The tarball can be downloaded at
<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html>. The repository is now
at Github, <https://github.com/gerdstolpmann/omake>. There is also an
issue tracker.

omake requires now ocaml-4.02 as minimum.

3) Bisect_ppx: removing report output formats, etc.
Archive: <https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-06/msg00030.html>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Anton Bachin announced:

We are in the process of removing the following features from Bisect_ppx, as we
don?t believe they are used:

- combine expressions (reporter?s -combine-expr)
- XML output
- EMMA output
- ?bisect? output [1]
- point kinds (mentioned earlier [2])

We would also like to remove ?dump? output, but we are using it internally for
testing.

Please let me know of any objections.

Best,
Anton

** Anton Bachin added:

I would like to clarify that -combine-expr is not about combining multiple
output files as in

bisect-ppx-report -html report *.out

That is not being removed.

-combine-expr is a separate feature that allows visitation counts of two or more
separate sets of *.out files to be manipulated, for example by subtracting them,
to obtain a new report.
