      <cwn_what>
I should add that the project is now available in the opam-repository, see
[solidity-parser](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/solidity-parser/) and
[solidity-typechecker](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/solidity-typechecker/).

      <cwn_title>Release of ocaml-pandoc 0.1.0</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-pandoc-0-1-0/7759/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Samuel Mimram announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I have just released [ocaml-pandoc](https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-pandoc), a native OCaml library to write filters
for [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which is a markdown-to-anything converter. It has allowed me to write some simple
filters I needed (such as for including code snippets, which is not supported natively).

The support is not complete yet however, I might add more if needed (and pull-requests are of course accepted
:slight_smile:).

You want to compare the main core functions found in the OCaml Stdlib (v4.12.0), Containers (v3.3), Batteries
(v3.3.0) and Base (v0.14.1) libraries ?

Check it out !

Someone reading this might be also interested in my (less formal) comparison between OCaml Stdlib and Base:

[Comby](https://comby.dev/) may also be of interest, it's a similar project also written in OCaml.

release is the updated version of merlin which brings lots of new bug fixes.

**** Fixes

- Fix interface/implementation switching on Windows (#427)

- Correctly parse project paths with spaces and other special characters that
  must be escaped.

- Print types with ~-short-paths~ even if the project wasn't built yet
