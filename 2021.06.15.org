** Chet Murthy announced


In the past, I've found doing this sort of dependency-graphing to be very useful for figuring out where
modularization in a large system needs to be applied.  And it's not very hard to do, based on ocamldep
output or other dependency information that already exists.

On a lark, I wrote something that did this for installed findlib packages:
https://github.com/chetmurthy/not-ocamlfind#package-graph

I mention this not to plug the tool, but rather, just to note that it's really easy, and yeah, people
should avail themselves of this more.

** Anil Madhavapeddy announced


Welcome to the May 2021 [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore][Multicore OCaml]] monthly
report! This month's update along with the [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/multicore-monthly][previous
updates]] have been compiled by @avsm, @ctk21,
@kayceesrk and @shakthimaan.

Firstly, all of our upstream activity on the OCaml compiler is now reported as part of the shiny new
[[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-compiler-development-newsletter-issue-2-may-2021/7965][compiler development newsletter
#2]] that
@gasche has started. This represents a small but important shift -- domains-only multicore is firmly
locked in on the upstream roadmap for OCaml 5.0 and the whole OCaml compiler team has been helping and
contributing to it, with the [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10039][GC safe points]] feature being
one of the last major multicore-prerequisites (and due to be in OCaml 4.13 soon).

This multicore newsletter will now focus on getting our ecosystem ready for domains-only multicore in
OCaml 5.0, and on how the (not-yet-official) effect system and multicore IO stack is progressing.  It's
a long one this month, so settle in with your favourite beverage and let's begin :-)

*** OCaml Multicore: 4.12.0+domains

The multicore compiler now supports CTF runtime traces of its garbage collector and there are [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eventlog-tools/tree/multicore_wip][tools to
display chrome tracing
visualisations]] of the garbage
collector events. A number of performance improvements (see speedup graphs later on) that highlight
some ways to make best use of multicore were made to the existing benchmarks in Sandmark.  There has
also been work on scaling up to 128 cores/domains for task-based parallelism in domainslib using [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/domainslib/pull/29][work
stealing deques]], bringing us closer to
Cilk-style task-parallel performance.

As important as new features are what we have decided _not_ to do. We've been working on and evaluating
Domain Local Allocation Buffers (DLABs) for some time, with the intention of reducing the cost of minor
GCs. We've found that the resulting performance didn't match our expectations (_vs_ the complexity of
the change), and so we've decided not to proceed with this for OCaml 5.0.  You can find the [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Domain-Local-Allocation-Buffers-Addendum][DLAB
summary]]
page summarises our experiences. We'll come back to this post-OCaml 5.0 when there are fewer moving
parts.

*** Ecosystem changes to prepare for 5.0.0 domains-only

As we are preparing 5.0 branches with the multicore branches over the coming months, we are stepping up
preparations to ensure the OCaml ecosystem is ready.

**** Making the multicore compilers available by default in opam-repo

Over the next few week, we will be merging the multicore 4.12.0+domains and associated packages from
their opam remote over in
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam][ocaml-multicore/multicore-opam]] into the mainline
opam-repository. This is to make it more convenient to use the variant compilers to start testing your
own packages with ~Domain~s.

As part of this change, there are two new base packages that will be available in opam-repository:

- ~base-domains~: This package indicates that the current compiler has the ~Domain~ module.
- ~base-effects~: This package indicates the current compiler has the experimental effect system.

By adding a dependency on these packages, the only valid solutions will be ~4.12.0+domains~ (until
OCaml 5.0 which will have this module) or ~4.12.0+effects~.

The goal of this is to let community packages more easily release versions of their code using
Domains-only parallelism ahead of OCaml 5.0, so that we can start migration and thread-safety early.
We do not encourage anyone to take a dependency on base-effects currently, as it is very much a moving
target.

This opam-repository change isn't in yet, but I'll comment on this post when it is merged.

**** Adapting the Stdlib for thread-safety

One of the first things we have to do before porting third-party libraries is to get the Stdlib ready
for thread-safety. This isn't quite as simple as it might appear at first glance: if we adopt the naïve
approach of simply putting a mutex around every bit of global state, our sequential performance will
slow down. Therefore we are performing a more fine-grained analysis and fixes, which can be seen [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Safety-of-Stdlib-under-Multicore-OCaml][on
the multicore stdlib
page]].

For anyone wishing to contribute: hunt through the Stdlib for global state, and categorise it
appropriately, and then create a test case exercising that module with multiple Domains running, and
submit a PR to [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore][ocaml-multicore]].  In general, if
you see any build failures or runtime failures now, we'd really appreciate an issue being filed there
too. You can see some good examples of such issues
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/574][here]] (for mirage-crypto) and
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/568][here]] (for Coqt).

**** Porting third-party libraries to Domains

As I mentioned last month, we put a call out for libraries and maintainers who wanted to port their
code over. We're starting with the following libraries and applications this month:

- *Lwt*: the famous lightweight-threads library now has a PR to add [[https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/pull/860][Lwt_domains]]. This is the first simple(ish) step to using multicore cores with Lwt: it lets you run a pure (non-Lwt) function in another Domain via ~detach : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b Lwt.t~.

- *Mirage-Crypto*: the next library we are adapting is the cryptography library, since it is also low-hanging fruit that should be easy to parallelise (since crypto functions do not have much global state). The port is still ongoing, as there are some minor build failures and also Stdlib functions in Format that aren't yet thread-safe that are [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/issues/563][causing failures]].

- *Tezos-Node*: the bigger application we are applying some of the previous dependencies too is Tezos-Node, which makes use of the dependency chain here via Lwt, mirage-crypto, Irmin, Cohttp and many other libraries. We've got this [[https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/2671][compiling under 4.12.0+domains]] now and mostly passing the test suite, but will only report significant results once the dependencies and Stdlib are passing.

- *Owl*: OCaml's favourite machine learning library works surprisingly well out-of-the-box with 4.12.0+domains. An experiment for a significant machine-learning codebase written using it saw about a 2-4x speedup before some false-sharing bottlenecks kicked in. This is pretty good going given that we made no changes to the codebase itself, but stay tuned for more improvements over the coming months as we analyse the bottleneck.

This is hopefully a signal to all of you to start "having a go" with 4.12.0+domains on your own
applications, and particularly with respect to seeing how wrapping it in Domains works out and
identifying global state. You can read our handy [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/parallel-programming-in-multicore-ocaml][tutorial on parallel programming with Multicore
OCaml]].

We are developing some tools to help find global state, but we're going to all need to work together to
identify some of these cases and begin migration.  Crucially, we need some diversity in our dependency
chains -- if you have interesting applications using (e.g.) Async or the vanilla ~Thread~ module and
have some cycles to work with us, please get in touch with me or @kayceesrk .

*** 4.12.0+effects

The effects-based [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio][eio library]] is coming together nicely, and
the interface and design rationales are all up-to-date in the README of the repository.  The primary IO
backend is [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-uring][ocaml-uring]], which we are preparing for a
separate release to opam-repository now as it also works fine on the sequential runtime for Linux (as
long as you have a fairly recent kernel. Otherwise the kernel crashes).  We also have a [[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/26][Grand Central
Dispatch effect backend]] to give us a totally different
execution model to exercise our effect handler abstractions.

While we won't publish the performance numbers for the effect-based IO this month, you can get a sense
of the sorts of tests we are running by looking at the
[[https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/retro-httpaf-bench][retro-httpaf-bench]] repository, which now has
various permutations of effects-based, uring-based and select-based webservers. We've submitted a talk
to the upcoming OCaml Workshop later this summer, which, if accepted, will give you a deepdive into our
effect-based IO.

As always, we begin with the Multicore OCaml ongoing and completed tasks.  The ecosystem improvements
are then listed followed by the updates to the Sandmark benchmarking project. Finally, the upstream
OCaml work is mentioned for your reference.  For those of you that have read this far and can think of
nothing more fun than hacking on multicore programming runtimes, we are hiring in the UK, France and
India -- please find the job postings at the end!

* First release of Popper
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-popper/7992/1

** Joel Bjornson announced


I am happy to announce a first release of [[https://github.com/jobjo/popper][Popper]] — an OCaml testing
library for writing simple unit tests as well as property-based tests, using a uniform API.

A few things that distinguishes [[https://github.com/jobjo/popper][Popper]] from other property-based
testing libraries:

1) Generic shrinking — when a property-based test fails, the test function attempts to shrink the sample data. This works for any data type.
2) Any invariants used when constructing samples for property-based tests are also respected when shrinking.
3) There is a [[https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ppx_deriving_popper/][ppx]] for automatically deriving sample functions (generators in QuickCheck style libs) for custom data types.

The library also supports bundling and nesting tests arbitrarily, colorful output inspired by
[[https://github.com/mirage/alcotest][Alcotest]], logging facilities and timing info.

Here are some starting points:

- The [[https://github.com/jobjo/popper][source repo]].
- A [[https://jobjo.github.io/popper/getting_started/][getting started guide]].
- The [[https://jobjo.github.io/popper/api/][API docs]].

Below is an example of what [[https://github.com/jobjo/popper][Popper]] output looks like. It was
generated by [[https://gist.github.com/jobjo/32f1b7297a330dc16d7a7c9fb15008fe][this code]].

This is a first release and there are few work-in-progress items. For instance:

- A CLI for filtering and sorting tests.
- An API for better blending with [[https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt][Lwt]] code bases.
- A better way for limiting shrinking times for failing test samples.

Any suggestions or other feedback is much appreciated!
      



* Orsetto: structured data interchange languages (release 1.1)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-orsetto-structured-data-interchange-languages-release-1-1/7995/1

** james woodyatt announced


Announcing the release to OPAM of [[http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/orsetto/][Orsetto 1.1]], an update to
a personal project of mine not sponsored by my employer. Licensed with BSD 2-Clause.

*** Q. What is Orsetto?

Aspires to do eventually for OCaml more or less what [[https://serde.rs][Serde]] has done for Rust, i.e.
to be a curated and self-contained collection of structured data interchange languages with a cohesive
and unified model of serialization and deserialization.

Two interchange languages are currently supported: [[https://json.org][JSON]] and
[[https://cbor.io][CBOR]].

*** Q. What is new in this release?

The change log for the release is here:
[[https://bitbucket.org/jhw/orsetto/src/r1.1/CHANGES.md][CHANGES.md]]

- Drops support for OCaml < 4.08.
- Major improvements in test coverage.
- Many corrections for logic errors.
- Issues [[https://conjury.atlassian.net/browse/ORS][database]] migrated to Atlassian Jira Cloud.
- A few important usability improvements (see below).

Some usability improvements are meant to replace obsolescent interfaces (now marked obsolescent with
~@ocaml.deprecated~). A few improvements to some interfaces with especially suboptimal design were
updated with breaking changes, but these are not expected to cause major upgrade problems for anyone.

Some things have not changed:

- Still requires *ocamlfind* and does not build with *dune*.
- Still only supports JSON and CBOR.

*** Q. It looks incomplete. What are your plans for future development?

Yes, it's a personal project. I'd welcome opportunities to collaborate with others who share my vision
for the project. As long as it's just me working on this, development will be somewhat slow. I have a
lot of projects. This is the only open source one.

- *Orsetto 1.0.3* is the previous release. It offered parsers and emitter combinators for JSON and CBOR for OCaml >= 4.06.1 (including 4.13~alpha1). The quality of its JSON support is adequate, and it scores well on the [[https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite][nst/JSONTestSuite]] tests. The quality of its CBOR support is provisional, and not recommended.

- *Orsetto 1.1* is the current release. It adds generalized and extensible structured data interchange models with specializations for producing emitters and parsers for JSON and CBOR. The quality of the CBOR support is much improved.

- *Orsetto 1.2* is the next planned release. It will drop interfaces marked ~@caml.deprecated~ in the 1.1 release. It will also drop support for OCaml < 4.10, and I'd like to stop depending on *ocamlfind*. I hope to add a PPX for deriving parsers and emitters from OCaml data type definitions. I might also consider one or more new interchange languages— suggestions are heartily encouraged.
