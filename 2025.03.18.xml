      <cwn_what>
I've written up my experience [upgrading Semgrep to OCaml 5](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/upgrading-semgrep-from-ocaml-4-to-ocaml-5/). The main barrier we faced was increased memory consumption, but I was able to tune the garbage collector to address this problem. We have also open-sourced the [utility I wrote](https://github.com/semgrep/dynamic-gc) to adjust the ~space_overhead~ GC parameter based on heap size. We are looking forward to taking advantage of all the great new features in OCaml 5!

      <cwn_what>
Recently, I have been working on a project called [longleaf](https://github.com/hesterjeng/longleaf) for algorithmic trading of US stocks with OCaml.  The project has reached a point where it may be interesting to others, so I thought I would share it here and write a simple README, although there could be a lot more documentation.  I would be curious to hear if anyone has any ideas for this!  If you try to use it or have any feedback or questions, feel free to leave a post here, make a github issue, or make a github discussion. 

In a nutshell, the idea is that strategies are functors that are instantiated with a "backend" for backtesting, live, or paper trading.  That way, whether you are testing your strategy or running it live, it is exactly the same strategy other than how the execution of orders is handled.  In order to use it, you will need to set up some accounts and there are likely bugs.  Of course, if you use this program with real money and something bad happens, it is entirely your responsibility!

In a different topics I wrote about about my recent work on neocaml, and I thought it might be a good idea to post something separately as well. Check out the project's GitHub [repo](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml) and the short [blog post](https://batsov.com/articles/2025/03/14/neocaml-a-new-emacs-package-for-ocaml-programming/).

Contributions and feedback are most welcome, and I hope ~neocaml~ will be useful to some of you either a tool or as a source of inspiration.

      <cwn_title>Upcoming Cmdliner 2.0 changes that need your attention</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/upcoming-cmdliner-2-0-changes-that-need-your-attention/16211/2</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Continuing this thread, Daniel BÃ¼nzli announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Other [changes](https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/issues/206) you may want to pay attention to is that cmdliner 2.0 will: 

1. Remove deprecated identifiers.
2. Make the [~Arg.conv~](https://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner/doc/Cmdliner/Arg/index.html#type-conv) type abstract[^1].

If you happen to be walking around your ~cmdliner~ usage or making a new cli these days, pay particular attention to 2. as the concrete type has been deprecated since 2017 but sadly it was never possible to make it a visible deprecation (OCaml compiler help us! :man_bowing:). 

Note that both 1. and 2. can be resolved now by using cmdliner.1.3.0, there are a few [instructions here](https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/issues/206). It's no guaranteed, but if you are on ~opam~ I may have filed an issue in your issue tracker :waving_hand:.

P.S. I think there's not a single occurence where I did not eventually regret making a public type concrete.

[^1]:  So that completion behaviours can be defined at that level; aswell as the documentation metavariable which you could specify with ~Arg.conv~ constructors for ages but would simply be dropped to return the concrete pair.

      <cwn_title>New release of Monolith (20250314)</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-monolith-20250314/16303/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>FranÃ§ois Pottier announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am pleased to announce a new "Pi Day" release of Monolith.

Monolith is an OCaml library that helps perform black-box testing of OCaml libraries, either via purely random testing, or via grey-box fuzzing.

This new release adds new command-line options to the executable program that Monolith produces by default. Furthermore, it extends Monolith's API with a new function, ~run~, so the user can invoke Monolith's engine as part of their own application, without letting Monolith parse the command line. These improvements make it easier to use a Monolith-based test as part of a continuous integration (CI) system. Thanks to Gabriel Scherer for suggesting these improvements.

#+begin_example
  opam update
  opam install monolith.20250314
#+end_example

Happy testing!
