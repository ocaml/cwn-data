* Good example of handwritten Lexer + Recursive Descent Parser?

** Axel Baudot asked


I am looking for an idiomatic implementation of a Lexer + Recursive Descent Parser not making use of ocamllex, ocamlyacc or menhir. The kind you would write during the first chapters of Crafting Interpreters [0][1] in OCaml.

This Markdown parser [2] by @dbuenzli is a great example of what I am looking for. I'd be happy if you can recommend similar resources.

There are many OCaml repos for Lox interpreters but it's hard to assess quality. And the readme often says "I am doing this to learn OCaml", which doesn't inspire confidence.

As a broader note, it would be nice to have (community vetted) OCaml translations of well-known learning material using mainstream languages. But I'll raise the topic in another thread later.

Thanks in advance.

You might be interested in the book [[https://keleshev.com/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch/][Compiling to Assembly from Scratch]].
There is a [[https://github.com/keleshev/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch/tree/main/contrib/ocaml][port to OCaml]]. It suggests the
use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator][parser combinators]]. 

Parser combinators is the same manual recursive descent method, but in a functional way.   You can either use [[https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom][an existing
library]] or you [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5IIXUBXvLs][can write your own]].
      

** Anton Bachin also replied


odoc's parser is half of what you're asking for. It uses ocamllex for the lexical scan, because it's very simple and convenient to
do it that way, but the syntax is then analyzed by a hand-written [[https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/blob/822d266232fccdffbd4922434c81c45ab6d583f4/src/parser/syntax.ml][recursive descent
parser]], in large part because
/that's/ easier for the doc language.

An example of a non-ocamllex and non-ocamlyacc parser is Markup.ml
([[https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/d686cce6bac6ff46a49b28ed0d957ffa1e37fda5/src/html_tokenizer.ml#L390][tokenizer]],
[[https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/d686cce6bac6ff46a49b28ed0d957ffa1e37fda5/src/html_parser.ml#L1386][parser]]). But this
isn't a traditional recursive descent parser. Rather, it's a pretty huge hand-written state machine in continuation-passing style,
almost completely implementing the corresponding huge state machine specified in HTML5. But it's the kind of code that fits well the
topics of an impure FP class, especially since it has mutable cells for its continuations, that it uses to mimic effects.
      



* Boulder Dash in OCaml

** Continuing this thread, Andreas Rossberg announced


Couldn’t let it rest, so I’m (already) announcing version 2 of it — now a much improved, practically feature-complete
reimplementation of both Boulder Dash 1 & 2.

Version 2 was an excuse for me to mess around with the OCaml bindings to popular graphics engines, and as a result, it now comes
with 3 backends to choose from:

1. the homely bare OCaml Graphics library (https://github.com/ocaml/graphics),
2. the TSDL binding to the SDL2 API (https://github.com/dbuenzli/tsdl),
3. the binding to the Raylib engine (https://github.com/tjammer/raylib-ocaml).

The list is in order of increasingly better user experience, for the price of a potentially harder build experience. In theory, all
versions should run on Windows, Mac, and Linux, though I was too lazy to test all combinations, and I (or my opam) had trouble
installing some of the dependencies on some of the systems.

Features:

- Faithful original physics, graphics, animations, sound, and music
- Authentic scrolling mechanics combined with dynamic resizing
- All 40 levels and 5 difficulties of Boulder Dash 1 & 2
- Pause-and-go mode for relaxed playing

Relative to the previous release, version 2 adds the following niceties:

- Support for SDL and Raylib engines, which allow all of the following
- Original sound effects and music
- Original level color schemes
- Full screen mode
- Faster graphics
- Dynamic graphics scaling adjustment
- Gamepad/joystick support as well as more precise keyboard controls
- Boulder Dash 2 levels and decoder

Almost looks like a real game now. One from the 80s anyways. :)

** Hhugo announced


I’m pleased to announce the release of js_of_ocaml 5.9.0. It should soon be available in opam.

Js_of_ocaml is a compiler from OCaml bytecode to JavaScript. It makes it
possible to run pure OCaml programs in JavaScript environment like browsers and
Node.js.

Most significant changes:

- Support for OCaml 5.3
- Speedup sourcemap generation and improve sourcemap accuracy.
- Prepare the merge of the wasm_of_ocaml fork back into the js_of_ocaml repo.
- JS backtraces are really expansive. They now need to be explicitly requested with ~OCAMLRUNPARM=b=1~. This speeds up programs linked with libraries enabling backtraces programmatically using ~Printexc.record_backtrace true~.

See the [[https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/blob/master/CHANGES.md][Changelog ]] for other changes.
      



* Liquidsoap 2.3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-liquidsoap-2-3-0/15677/1

** Romain Beauxis announced


We are stoked to announce the ~2.3.0~ release of liquidsoap, a general-purpose scripting language written in OCaml with specialized operators to build media streams.

The release is available on github: https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases/tag/v2.3.0

During this release cycle, we have rewritten huge chunk of the application's internal, including a new media streaming abstraction and clock system.

As an OCaml application, liquidsoap's scope and complexity has greatly expanded in the next years.

Some of the most challenging areas for us at this point are memory usage (and, incidentally, CPU usage).

Although OCaml's garbage collection is a very powerful tool, in the context of very short lived streaming cycles (typically ~0.02s~) with potentially quite large memory allocations (typically video images), controlling the timing of memory allocations and release is becoming more and more critical.

We are also aware of the work done by Jane St on adding a ~local~ call stack. This could be an avenue to explore as well but:
1. Some of our content has to be stored in the long-term heap
2. We want to work with an official OCaml compiler for obvious long-term maintenance concerns.

Nonetheless, we are thrilled to be part of a community whose array of tools (building, packaging, debugging, etc) and libraries has expanded so well along with a vibrant compiler development team.

In the future, we wish to explore more of the new OCaml concurrency features. This might require that we revisit the way we handle short-term memory first.
      



* Bytesrw 0.1.0 – Composable byte stream readers and writers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 5
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-bytesrw-0-1-0-composable-byte-stream-readers-and-writers/15696/1

** Daniel Bünzli announced


It's my pleasure to announce the first release of the ~bytesrw~ library:

#+begin_quote
Bytesrw extends the OCaml ~Bytes~ module with composable, memory efficient, byte stream readers and writers compatible with effect-based concurrency.

Except for byte slice life-times, these abstractions intentionally  separate away ressource management and the specifics of reading and writing bytes.

Bytesrw distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies.

Optional support for compressed and hashed bytes depend, at your wish, on  the C [[https://zlib.net][~zlib~]], [[http://zstd.net][~libzstd~]], [[https://blake3.io][~blake3~]], [[https://www.hadrons.org/software/libmd/][~libmd~]], [[https://xxhash.com/][~xxhash~]] and libraries.
#+end_quote

The only reason I was longing for OCaml algebraic effects was so that I could avoid using them: when you write codecs on byte streams it should not be a concern where your bytes are coming from or headed to. The ~bytesrw~ library provides structures to abstract this. Additionally it establishes a buffer ownership discipline that enables byte streams to (de)compose while remaining memory efficient.

I do not expect the library to change much and it has been used. But it's new and practice may call for adjustments. Do not hesitate to get in touch if you run into problems or see obvious defects or improvements. I do expect the library will add more convenience (e.g. for processing lines and UTF) and more optional stream formats over time.

- Homepage: https://erratique.ch/software/bytesrw
- Docs: https://erratique.ch/software/bytesrw/doc or ~odig doc bytesrw~
- Install: ~opam install bytesrw conf-zlib conf-zstd conf-libblake3 conf-libmd conf-xxhash~ ([[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/26990][opam PR]])

This first release was made possible thanks to a grant from the [[https://ocaml-sf.org/][OCaml Software Foundation]]. I also thank my [[https://github.com/sponsors/dbuenzli][donors]] for their support.

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dream-html-pure-html-3-5-2/14808/5

** Yawar Amin announced


[ANN] dream-html 3.7.0

Happy to announce the addition of a helper module for typed form decoding functionality. See the docs here: https://yawaramin.github.io/dream-html/dream-html/Dream_html/Form/index.html

An example:

#+begin_src ocaml
type user = { name : string; age : int option }

open Dream_html.Form

let user_form =
  let+ name = required string "name"
  and+ age = optional int "age" in
  { name; age }

let dream_form = ["age", "42"; "name", "Bob"]
let user_result = validate user_form dream_form
(* => Ok { name = "Bob"; age = Some 42 } *)

let error_result = validate user_form ["age", "none"]
(* => Error [("age", "error.expected.int"); ("name", "error.required")] *)
#+end_src

Astute readers may observe that this provides some convenience functionality beyond what Dream itself offers; to validate the above form and get a _complete_ set of field validation errors using only Dream you would do something like:

#+begin_src ocaml
let user_result = match dream_form with
  | ["age", age; "name", name] ->
    (match int_of_string age with
    | age -> Ok { name; age = Some age }
    | exception Failure _ -> Error ["age", "error.expected.int"])
  | ["name", name] -> Ok { name; age = None }
  | ["age", age] ->
    (match int_of_string age with
    | age -> Error ["name", "error.required"]
    | exception Failure _ -> Error ["age", "error.expected.int"; "name", "error.required"])
  | _ -> Error ["name", "error.required"]
#+end_src

And this is a form with only two fields. You can imagine how convoluted the logic would be for more complex forms. Of course, you might just decide to use ~List.assoc_opt~ and build up the validation errors, but even that can get tricky. So if you are making heavy use of HTML forms, a helper module that takes care of all these validation details can be very useful. Enjoy!
      



* Second beta release of OCaml 5.3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 7
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/second-beta-release-of-ocaml-5-3-0/15700/1

** octachron announced


One month after the release of the first beta for OCaml 5.3.0,  we are releasing a second and hopefully last beta release for OCaml 5.3.0 .

The most notable changes for this second beta are probably a handful of type system bugfixes. In particular, those fixes revert a change of behaviour in the first beta when pattern matching GADTs with non-injective type parameters.

We also have a C++ header compatibility fix and the restoration of some configuration variable in Makefiles for the sake of backward compatibility.

Overall, the release is converging and we are expecting to have a first release candidate around the middle of December. The progresses on stabilising the ecosystem are tracked on the
[[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/26596][opam readiness for 5.3.0 meta-issue]].

Meanwhile, the second beta release of OCaml 5.3.0 is here to help you update
your software and libraries ahead of the release (see below for the installation
instructions).

The full release is expected before the end of December.

If you find any bugs, please report them on [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues][OCaml's issue tracker]].

If you are interested in full list of features and bug fixes of the new OCaml version, the updated change log for OCaml 5.3.0 is available [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/5.3/Changes][on GitHub]].

Happy hacking,
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.

*** Installation Instructions

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following commands
on opam 2.1 and later:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create 5.3.0~beta2
#+end_example

The source code for the beta is also available at these addresses:

- [[https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/5.3.0-beta2.tar.gz][GitHub]]
- [[https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-5.3/ocaml-5.3.0~beta2.tar.gz][OCaml archives at Inria]]

**** Fine-Tuned Compiler Configuration

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can switch to the option variant with:

#+begin_example
opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta2+options <option_list>
#+end_example

where ~option_list~ is a space separated list of ~ocaml-option-*~ packages. For instance, for a flambda and no-flat-float-array switch:

#+begin_example
opam switch create 5.3.0~beta2+flambda+nffa ocaml-variants.5.3.0~beta2+options ocaml-option-flambda ocaml-option-no-flat-float-array
#+end_example

All available options can be listed with ~opam search ocaml-option~.

* New release of Monolith
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 8
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-monolith/15701/1

** François Pottier announced


I am pleased to announce a new release of [[https://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/monolith/doc/monolith/Monolith/][Monolith]], a library that helps perform strong automated testing of OCaml libraries.
#+begin_example
opam update
opam install monolith.20241126
#+end_example

The changes are as follows:

- The documentation of the specification combinators has been re-organized
  in sections and subsections. Finding the desired combinator should now be
  easier.

- The new combinator ~naive_array~ offers limited support for arrays.

- The new combinator ~naive_seq~ offers limited support for sequences
  (that is, for the type constructor ~Seq.t~).

- The new combinator ~pair~ is a synonym for ~( *** )~.

- The new combinator ~triple~ offers support for triples.

- The new combinator ~either~ offers support for the type constructor
  ~Either.t~.

- The new combinators ~iter~, ~foldr~, ~foldl~, ~iteri~, ~foldri~, ~foldli~
  offer support for iteration functions.

- An unintentional and undocumented limitation has been fixed: so far, uses of
  the combinator ~map_into~ would work only at the root of the specification
  or in the right-hand side of an arrow ~^>~. It should now be possible to use
  ~map_into~ under other combinators that expect a deconstructible
  specification, such as ~^!>~ (in the right-hand side), ~( *** )~, ~option~,
  ~result~, ~list~, etc. This improvement affects not only ~map_into~, but
  also a number of other combinators that are defined in terms of ~map_into~.

- Monolith now requires OCaml 4.12 or later.

- In ~Makefile.monolith~,
  + the default switch is changed from 4.11.1 to 4.14.2;
    this can be overridden by defining ~SWITCH~;
  + ~make test~ automatically disables the MacOS crash reporter;
  + the use of ~ulimit -s~ is abandoned.
      



* Jsont 0.1.0 – Declarative JSON data manipulation for OCaml
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-jsont-0-1-0-declarative-json-data-manipulation-for-ocaml/15702/1

** Daniel Bünzli announced


It's my pleasure to announce the first release of the jsont libary: 

#+begin_quote
Jsont is an OCaml library for declarative JSON data manipulation. It provides:

- Combinators for describing JSON data using the OCaml values of your choice. The descriptions can be used by generic functions to decode, encode, query and update JSON data without having to construct a generic JSON representation.
- A JSON codec with optional text location tracking and layout preservation. The codec is compatible with effect-based concurrency.

The descriptions are independent from the codec and can be used by third-party processors or codecs.

Jsont is distributed under the ISC license. It has no dependencies. The codec is optional and depends on the [[https://erratique.ch/software/bytesrw][~bytesrw~]] library. The JavaScript support is optional and depends on the [[https://erratique.ch/software/brr][~brr~]] library.
#+end_quote

The library has been used in practice but it's new so a few adjustments may be needed and more convenience combinators added.

The library also enables quite a few things that I did not have the time to explore like schema description generation from descriptions, quasi-streaming JSON transformations, description generation from dynamic type representations, etc. Lots of this can be done outside the core library, do not hesitate to get in touch if you use the library and find interesting applications or pesking limitations.

- Homepage: https://erratique.ch/software/jsont
- Docs: https://erratique.ch/software/jsont/doc (or ~odig doc jsont~)
- Install: ~opam install jsont bytesrw~

This first release was made possible thanks to a grant from the [[https://ocaml-sf.org/][OCaml Software Foundation]]. I also thank my [[https://github.com/sponsors/dbuenzli][donors]] for their support.

Best,

Daniel

P.S. I think that the technique used by the library, which I dubbed /finally tagged/ is interesting in itself. You can read a paper about it [[https://github.com/dbuenzli/jsont/tree/main/paper][here]] along with a smaller, self-contained, implementation of what the library does.
      



* Tiny educational concurrent I/O and promises library
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 10
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/tiny-educational-concurrent-i-o-and-promises-library/15703/1

** Mikhail announced


I like [[https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt][Lwt]]. It's a fantastic library, but how does it work? I spent a few days studying its source code. 

Finally, inspired by the implementation of [[https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt][Lwt]] and [[https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/ds/promises.html][the CS3110 chapter, 8.7. Promises]]. I wrote a maximally stupid [[https://github.com/dx3mod/tiny-async-lib][*tiny-async-lib*]] library. 

Maybe you may be interested in this naive implementation. 

*** Examples of use
#+begin_src ocaml
let () = 
  Engine.run main begin
    let* () = Io.(write_all stdout) "Hi! What's your name? " in
    let* name = Io.(read_line stdin) in
    Io.(write_all stdout) ("Hello, " ^ name ^ "!\n")
  end
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
let read_and_print_file filename = 
  Io.(read_file filename >>= write_all stdout)

let _ =
  Engine.run begin
    let filenames = [ (* ... *) ] in  

    filenames
    |> List.map read_and_print_file
    |> Promise.join
  end
#+end_src

*** Implementation details

The first key abstraction of the whole library is, of course, Promise. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises][Promise]] is an abstraction for synchronizing program execution in concurrent evaluations. In simple terms, it's an abstraction over callbacks. Promises allows us to build (monadic) sequence evaluations inside of non-sequence evaluations.

#+begin_src ocaml
(* promise.ml *)

type 'a t = { mutable state: 'a state }  

and 'a state = 
  | Fulfilled of 'a 
  | Rejected of exn
  | Pending of 'a callback list 

and 'a callback = 'a state -> unit 
#+end_src

Promises are represented as a mutable record with three possible states: fulfilled (contains a value), rejected (contains an exception), and pending (contains callbacks). 

Callbacks are functions that are called when a promise is resolved.
So when we ~bind~, if the promise is in pending state, we add a callback that calls the following monadic sequence when the promise is resolved.

#+begin_src ocaml
(* io.ml *)

let sleep delay =
  let p, r = Promise.make () in

  Engine.(on_timer instance) delay (fun handler ->
      Engine.stop_handler handler;
      Promise.fulfill r ());

  p
#+end_src

The second key abstraction is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O][asynchronous I/O]] engine that polls I/O events and dispatches them to handlers. Original Lwt has few engines (like based libev, select, poll), but I hardcoded a [select](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(Unix))-based engine inspired by ~Lwt_engine.select_based~. 

The typical async engine in internals has an event loop. At each iteration of the event loop, the engine polls for new events and calls handlers to handle them. 

#+begin_src ocaml
(* engine.ml *)

let iter engine =
  (* ... *)

  let readable_fds, writable_fds, _ =
    Unix.select readable_fds writable_fds [] timeout
  in

  engine.sleepers <- restart_sleepers now engine.sleepers;

  invoke_io_handlers engine.wait_readable readable_fds;
  invoke_io_handlers engine.wait_writable writable_fds
#+end_src

How to execute I/O promise? It's not a big deal. 
#+begin_src ocaml
(* engine.ml *)

let rec run promise =
  match Promise.state promise with
  | Fulfilled value -> value
  | Rejected exc -> raise exc
  | Pending _ ->
      iter instance;
      run promise
#+end_src

We just need to loop the event loop until the promis is resolved.

It's just a toy! I'm not an expert in such things, so the library is very naive and tries to mimic Lwt. But I think it's a good demonstration.

I figured people might be bored of [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-queenshead-a-british-pub-name-generator/13124][British pub names]] by now so I did another thing: [[https://raphael-proust.gitlab.io/code/areas-and-adversaries.html][a generator for titles of table-top role-playing games]].

#+begin_example
$ opam install areas-and-adversaries
...
$ areas-and-adversaries
Woods & Wizards
#+end_example

The code is on Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust/areas-and-adversaries

It was a good excuse to experiment with non-dune build systems (to scope things out). I went for a plain Makefile in the end which works well.

I also wanted to figure out a better way to embed data in an executable. I ended up wondering about moving as much of the processing as possible into the build phase. What I ended up with is a small program which prints a compilation unit (~.ml~) which has mostly array literals. Still have some open questions on that, any input welcome:
- Should I have used meta-ocaml to print the code? The ~data/munch.ml~ would probably be more readable, but the build probably less.
- How could I generate this kind of processed-data code for data-structures which don't have a literal (maps, sets, hash tables, etc.)? How can I minimise the initialisation cost of the program for such situations?

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-mariadb-1-2-0/15709/1

** Petter A. Urkedal announced


I'm please to announce a new release of the [[https://github.com/ocaml-community/ocaml-mariadb][mariadb]] package, which provides client bindings for MariaDB and MySQL. See the full release notes below.

This is also to announce that I have taken over maintenance of the project.  Currently I am the sole maintainer (and I usually use PostgreSQL for my own deployments), so if someone has the time en interest to contribute, let me know.  The main focus from my side is to keep the project up to date and stable, rather than making major changes.

Release notes:

  - Added ~Stmt.start_txn~ (#59 by Corentin Leruth).                               
  - Added ~Res.insert_id~ as binding for ~mysql_stmt_insert_id~ (#58 by            
    Corentin Leruth).                                                              
  - Updated to support recent OCaml versions (#45 by @kit-ty-kate).                
  - Fixed too-early retrieval of statement metadata (#41 by Albert Peschar).       
  - Fixed decoding bug for the integer type (#54 by Raman Varabets, tested         
    by #61 by Corentin Leruth).                                                    
  - Fixed a memory leaks related to result metadata (#39 by Albert Peschar).       
  - The build system is now dune and dune-configurator (#52 by Petter A.           
    Urkedal) and some of the examples have been converted to a test suite          
    (#60 by Petter A. Urkedal).                                                    
  - The project has been transferred to ocaml-community with Petter A.             
    Urkedal as the new maintainer.
      



* Proposed Package Archiving Policy for the opam Repository
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 14

Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/proposed-package-archiving-policy-for-the-opam-repository/15713/1

** Hannes Mehnert announced


It is my please to announce the proposed package archiving policy in the name of the opam-repository maintainers.

*** Context

The opam repository differs from nearly all other programming-language-centric package repositories in that it is manually curated by volunteer maintainers and protected by a robust continuous integration system that (generally) ensures published packages work as expected across a [[https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci/blob/master/doc/platforms.md][large matrix of supported platforms]].

Over the past few years the repository has kept growing steadily, when not accelerating, and this has started raising questions about the size, weight and sustainability of the repository and its processes. Last year, [[https://github.com/hannesm][Hannes Mehnert]] requested comments on a [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/23789][proposed initiative]] to improve the sustainability and quality of the opam package repository on the long term.

*** Problem

The problem, in a nutshell, is that the ~opam-repository~ will keep steadily growing, using an increasing and substantial amount of space and inodes. Every opam user needs to invest a large amount of computational resources for the solver, every time they want to install or update a package. Additionally, a large amount of computational resources are spent in the continuous integration process and yet a lot of the packages have become stale or uninstallable.

*** Solution

[[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/23789][After much deliberation]], the discussion converged on a solution: introduce a package archiving policy and supporting processes, to periodically identify and prune unmaintained and broken packages from the repository. This will improve the performance of the opam solvers, of the opam-repo CI, and most importantly improve the quality of the package repository, while keeping a sort of immutability of the repository content and preserving the usability of historical packages for the users that want or need them.

The opam repository maintainers propose a [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/governance/policies/archiving.md][policy]].

The currently empty [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository-archive][repository archive]] has been created, waiting for packages to be moved.

*** Call to action

If you maintain packages in the opam-repository, you can help by defining your maintanence intent: add a new field ~x-maintenance-intent~ to your opam file(s) (the most recent release of your package is sufficient - please also put this field in your git repository so it will be part of future releases). The value is defined in [[https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/governance/policies/archiving.md#specification-of-the-x--fields-used-in-the-archiving-process][the policy]].

*** Roadmap

All announcements will be on discuss.ocaml.org with the opam-repository tag. If you like to follow these announcements, keep your eyes at [[https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/opam-repository][the opam-repository tag]].

- December 1st 2024: announcement of this proposal
- December 15th 2024: announcement of the packages affected by Phase 1 (uninstallable packages ("available: false", "flags: avoid-version" or "deprecated", "opam admin check --installable", does not compile -- opam health check https://check.ci.ocaml.org/)
- January 1st 2025: Phase 1 cutting point: packages are moved to opam-repository-archive
- January 15th 2025: announcement of the packages affected by Phase 2 (OCaml lower bound 4.08)
- February 1st 2025: Phase 2 cutting point: packages are moved to opam-repository-archive
- February 15th 2025: initial spring cleaning, announcement of packages (based on maintenance-intent)
- March 1st 2025: spring cleaning cutting point: packages are moved to opam-repository-archive
- Every quarter: repeat Phase 3
- Every year: reconsider Phase 2 with an increased OCaml lower bound

We now invite members of the OCaml community who may not follow the ocaml-repository issues to review our plans and submit comments, questions, or suggestions.

Thank you in advance for your support!

* capnp-rpc 2.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 15
:END:
Archive: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-capnp-rpc-2-0/15739/1

** Thomas Leonard announced


I'm pleased to announce the release of [[https://github.com/mirage/capnp-rpc/releases/tag/v2.0][capnp-rpc 2.0]], an OCaml implementation of the Cap'n Proto RPC specification.

If you haven't used the library before, please see the [[https://github.com/mirage/capnp-rpc/blob/master/README.md][documentation and tutorial]]. Cap'n Proto RPC aims to provide secure, efficient, typed communications between multiple parties.

The main change in this version is the switch from Lwt to Eio for concurrency. The echo benchmark is about 40% faster than before. This isn't because Eio is actually that much faster than Lwt, but more because it has better profiling support so spotting problems was easier. See https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2024/07/22/performance/ for an example:

https://roscidus.com/blog/images/perf/capnp-eio-slow-zoom1-debug.png

There is a ~capnp-rpc-lwt~ compatibility package that provides the old Lwt API using the new Eio version, allowing libraries using the old API to be used in applications using the new code, without having to update everything at once.

To migrate to the new version (checking everything still works after each step):

1. First, update to capnp-rpc 1.2.4 (this ensures you are using the newer mirage-crypto API, to get that migration out of the way first).
2. Switch your application (that sets up the networking) to capnp-rpc-unix 2.0.
3. Migrate client and server code away from capnp-rpc-lwt when convenient.

For more detailed instructions, see [[https://github.com/mirage/capnp-rpc/blob/master/CHANGES.md#v20][the changelog]].

Here's an example of the changes needed in the solver-service project:
- [[https://github.com/talex5/solver-service/commit/a4af17b5ea44e94579fc0ca01fd0c618a5182df4][Update to capnp-rpc-unix 2.0]]
- [[https://github.com/talex5/solver-service/commit/74431efd36f4474236401f0556fad80de22b1b42][Remove Capnp_rpc_lwt]]
