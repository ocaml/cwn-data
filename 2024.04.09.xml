      <cwn_who>Simon Cruanes announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Dearest friends of the dual hump,

I'm happy to announce the release of [moonpool 0.6](https://github.com/c-cube/moonpool/releases/tag/v0.6). Moonpool is a library of
schedulers and concurrency primitives for OCaml 4.xx and 5.xx, based on threads (possibly spread on multiple domains). Previous
release announcements ([0.5](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-moonpool-0-5/13387),
[0.4](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-4/12941), [0.3](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-3/12632),
[0.2](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-2/12447), [0.1](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-moonpool-0-1/12387)) contain more
details.

This release is fairly large and contains some new libraries. The biggest improvement is the addition of ~moonpool.fib~ (OCaml 5
only): it defines lightweight _fibers_ with structured concurrency, where the fibers can run on a thread pool chosen by the user.
Fibers also come with fiber-local storage and a notion of cancellation that is propagated to children fibers. Overall, fibers are a
nicer abstraction than bare futures (especially with monadic combinators). There are currently no cooperative IO primitives provided
by the scheduler but I have plans.

Another new, more experimental library is ~moonpool-lwt~ (OCaml 5 only) which allows for interoperability between Lwt and moonpool: a
moonpool future (or fiber) can be turned into a Lwt promise; and it becomes possible to ~await~ a Lwt promise from moonpool, in a
thread-safe way.

      <cwn_title>Miou, a simple scheduler for OCaml 5</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-miou-a-simple-scheduler-for-ocaml-5/12963/14</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Calascibetta Romain announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
I am delighted to announce the release of ~miou.0.1.0~. This release is undoubtedly the culmination and synthesis of the work of
several individuals to offer a library that best fits our needs. We're quite convinced by the API we're proposing and quite happy
with the implementation. As such, we're coming out of beta to offer version 0.1.0. Above all, this means that the API will change
very little, and the library is now ready for use. However, we are not yet in 1.0.0 because we would like to give you time to use
Miou, to observe possible bugs, and to give us time to correct these possible bugs in order to prepare version 1.0.0 with peace of
mind. You can install the package via OPAM (it will be available soon):
#+begin_src shell
$ opam install miou
#+end_src

We would sincerely like to thank all individuals who have contributed, whether directly or indirectly, to the project.

Furthermore, this new version of Miou builds upon the excellent work of @polytypic and his [picos](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/picos) project. We have
incorporated certain elements that are suitable for implementing a scheduler, and we hope that our efforts will lead to a certain
standardization of the effects used by different schedulers in OCaml.

This rewrite has been carried out while trying to maintain the same semantics and API as what we offered in version ~0.0.1~beta2~
(however, it is the nature of a beta to potentially break versions). This rewrite culminated in the reimplementation of an [HTTP
client and server](https://github.com/robur-coop/httpcats) (supporting http/1.1
or h2 with TLS which can handle [200k req/sec](https://twitter.com/Dinoosaure/status/1775586989749788745)) as well as our good old [happy-eyeballs](https://github.com/robur-coop/miou/tree/main/happy) example. Moreover, the outcome
of these implementations is more satisfying to us than their previous versions. At least for now, considering the various changes our
cooperative has embarked on¹, we will not yet release them.

We also took the time to integrate a version of the priority queue verified using [Why3](https://www.why3.org/). We would like to thank @Armael and
@backtracking (as well as the individuals who contributed to and maintained the [Vocal](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/vocal) project) for their assistance.

Finally, I would like to personally thank the [Robur](https://robur.coop/) cooperative for providing me with the necessary time to evolve this
project.

This release further confirms what we aim to offer to users, and in this regard, we have taken the time to write a small book
explaining the use of Miou. This can also be seen as an introduction to asynchronous programming and effects. It is available
[here](https://robur-coop.github.io/miou/) and is part of the Miou distribution.

For any questions or assistance, we are available via email, this forum, or Discord.

Happy hacking!

*¹*: As explained in [this article](https://blog.robur.coop/articles/speeding-ec-string.html), we try to replace ~Cstruct.t~ by ~string~ and it requires
obviously a deep change across severals packages.

      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-org-newsletter-march-2024/14431/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Sabine Schmaltz announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Welcome to the March 2024 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This update has been compiled by the OCaml.org team. You can find
[previous updates](https://discuss.ocaml.org/tag/ocamlorg-newsletter) on Discuss.

Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants to get started and be productive in OCaml. The OCaml.org
newsletter provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview of the changes we are working on.

We couldn't do it without all the amazing OCaml community members who help us review, revise, and create better OCaml documentation.
Your feedback enables us to better prioritise our work. Thank you!

This newsletter covers:
- *OCaml Cookbook:* A prototype of an OCaml cookbook that provides short code examples that solve practical problems using packages from the OCaml ecosystem is on staging.ocaml.org/cookbook.
- *Dark Mode:* We enabled the dark mode on all pages of OCaml.org, based on your operating system / browser settings.
- *Community &amp; Marketing Pages Rework:* We are seeking feedback on wireframes for the community section and for the marketing-related pages.
- *General Improvements:* As usual, we also worked on general maintenance and improvements based on user feedback, so we're highlighting some of our work below.

*** Open Issues for Contributors

You can find [open issues for contributors
here](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee)!

*** Upcoming OCaml Cookbook

We're in the process of adding a community-driven section to the Learn area: the OCaml Cookbook. This cookbook is designed as a
collection of recipes, offering code samples for tackling real-world tasks using packages from the OCaml ecosystem. It's a practical
effort to enrich our learning resources, making them more applicable and useful for our community.

This month, our focus shifted towards finalizing the cookbook for release. This includes
- restructuring the directory structure and placement of recipe files, and
- adding tasks to the cookbook, so that you can contribute recipes for these tasks (we took inspiration from the excellent [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)).

It will always be possible to propose more tasks for the OCaml Cookbook. The main criteria here are:
1. task must require more than just a single Standard Library function call to solve,
2. task must be focused on common problems that occur when trying to build products,
3. if in doubt, make the task more specific, instead of more generic.

A good place to give feedback on the cookbook is [this discuss
thread](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/feedback-help-wanted-upcoming-ocaml-org-cookbook-feature/14127/10).

*** Homepage &amp; Marketing Pages Rework

The Home page project kicked off with an analysis of user surveys and interviews, and the development of an initial wireframe for the
homepage and the "Industrial Users" and "Academic Users" pages.

We've been [reaching out to the community on Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/academic-ocaml-users-testimonials/14338) and
Twitter to find what people say about OCaml, so we can give a bit more context through testimonials on the "Academic Users" page.

Besides this, we've been [asking on Twitter for ideas for the main tagline of the
homepage](https://x.com/sabine_s_/status/1772264108479467629?s=20)

You can comment on the wireframes in Figma
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/eLNSdvayxqvvfBsRsdbJXN/OCaml-Home-Page?type=design&amp;node-id=5%3A2500&amp;mode=design&amp;t=hHclskuVpoOzKP2u-1).

If you have opinions on the homepage, feel free to share them in [this discuss
thread](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/your-feedback-needed-on-ocaml-home-page-wireframe/14366)!

*** Community Section Rework

This week, we focused on creating wireframes for the Event, Job, Internship, and Workshop pages, followed by soliciting feedback from
the community via Discuss. Concurrently, work commenced on the UI design for the Community Landing page, as well as the Event and Job
pages.

We also made some improvements to the Events section on the Community page. This involves better treatment of start/end times of
events, as well as listing more upcoming events.

If you have opinions on the community section, feel free to share them in [this discuss
thread](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/looking-for-ideas-for-the-community-page-at-ocaml-org/14032/9)!

*** Outreachy Application Period &amp; Internship

In March, OCaml.org hosted the application period for one [Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) on creating an
interactive experience for solving OCaml exercises.

The process of selecting an Outreachy intern involved creating and managing 15 issues, reviewing 61 pull requests from 8 applicants.
The tasks were similar in nature and dealt with restructuring the exercises to enable an interactive experience, adding test cases
and solutions (where missing).

      <cwn_title>dune 3.15</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-3-15/14438/1</cwn_url>
      <cwn_who>Marek Kubica announced</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
We're happy to announce that Dune 3.15.0 is now available. This feature has many fixes and new features that you can find in the
changelog.

There are a few new features that we would like to specially highlight.

*** Removal of previous limitations in many forms

Prior to Dune 3.15 there were a number of limitations where percent forms like ~%{env:...}~ could be used to expand to useful values.
In this release, @rgrinberg put some effort to relax a lot of these restrictions where possible.

In the new version some of these limitations have been lifted, so for example ~{env:...}~ can be used in ~install~ stanzas
([#10160](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10160)).

Likewise there was no consistency where ~%{cma:...}~ or ~%{cmo:...}~ could be used. With
[#10169](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10169), these forms should work consistently everywhere.

Similarly the variables allowed in ~enabled_if~ fields have been expanded in [#10250](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10250), from
just allowing variables that can be computed from the context to now allowing all variables as long as expanding these variables does
not introduce dependency cycles.

These relaxed rules can also be combined to enable a library depending on environment variables, e.g. ~(enabled_if
%{env:ENABLE_LIBFOO=false}))~.

*** Overlapping names in different contexts

Continuing the theme of conditionally enabling or disabling code to be built,
@jchavarri and @rgrinberg's work on [#10220](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/10220) makes it possible to have overlapping names
between ~executable~ and ~melange.emit~ targets. This can be useful when a name is to be shared in different contexts (e.g. one
context with native compilation and one emitting code for the browser).

*** Properly output UTF-8 encoded text when formatting

Dune does not assume an encoding of dune files, however when files were formatted the formatter would err on the safe side and escape
bytes outside the ASCII range. This means that UTF-8 characters outside of ASCII would get escaped into decimal escape sequences.

This was especially annoying in places where the user would write natural language texts, which is common when defining Opam packages
in ~dune-project~ files. For example a discussion of a paper by Paul Erdős, Peter Frankl, Vojtěch Rödl would upon reformatting be
turned into Paul Erd\\197\\145s, Peter Frankl, Vojt\\196\\155 R\\195\\182, which does a disservice to these scientists and is hard to
read.

Thanks to the work of @moyodiallo in [#9728](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/9728) starting with Dune 3.15 the original encoding
will be preserved, so your package descriptions will be more readable.

*** Changelog

**** Added

- Add link flags to to ~ocamlmklib~ for ctypes stubs (#8784, @frejsoya)
- Remove some unnecessary limitations in the expansions of percent forms in install stanza. For example, the ~%{env:..}~ form can be used to select files to be installed. (#10160, @rgrinberg)
- Allow artifact expansion percent forms (~%{cma:..}~, ~%{cmo:..}~, etc.) in more contexts. Previously, they would be randomly forbidden in some fields. (#10169, @rgrinberg)
- Allow ~%{inline_tests}~ in more contexts (#10191, @rgrinberg)
- Remove limitations on percent forms in the ~(enabled_if ..)~ field of libraries (#10250, @rgrinberg)
- Support dialects in ~dune describe pp~ (#10283, @emillon)
- Allow defining executables or melange emit stanzas with the same name in the same folder under different contexts. (#10220, @rgrinberg, @jchavarri)

**** Fixed

- coq: Delay Coq rule setup checks so OCaml-only packages can build in hybrid Coq/OCaml projects when ~coqc~ is not present. Thanks to @vzaliva for the test case and report (#9845, fixes #9818, @rgrinberg, @ejgallego)
- Fix conditional source selection with ~select~ on ~bigarray~ in OCaml 5 (#10011, @moyodiallo)
- melange: fix inconsistency in virtual library implementation. Concrete modules within a virtual library can now refer to its virtual modules too (#10051, fixes #7104, @anmonteiro)
- melange: fix a bug that would cause stale ~import~ paths to be emitted when moving source files within ~(include_subdirs ..)~ (#10286, fixes #9190, @anmonteiro)
- Dune file formatting: output utf8 if input is correctly encoded (#10113, fixes #9728, @moyodiallo)
- Fix expanding dependencies and locks specified in the cram stanza. Previously, they would be installed in the context of the cram test, rather than the cram stanza itself (#10165, @rgrinberg)
- Fix bug with ~dune exec --watch~ where the working directory would always be set to the project root rather than the directory where the command was run (#10262, @gridbugs)
- Regression fix: sign executables that are promoted into the source tree (#10263, fixes #9272, @emillon)
- Fix crash when decoding dune-package for libraries with ~(include_subdirs qualified)~ (#10269, fixes #10264, @emillon)

*** Changed

- Remove the ~--react-to-insignificant-changes~ option. (#10083, @rgrinberg)

      <cwn_what>
Following the release of Eio 1.0 (https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-eio-1-0-first-major-release/14334), Eio goes into maintenance mode
for a bit. We've decided to pause the Eio developer meetings until further notice. Meanwhile, we remain active on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/issues) and the [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#eio:roscidus.com). I encourage
folks to try out Eio and report their findings.

      <cwn_title>Ocaml developer at Routine, Paris</cwn_title>

Routine ([https://routine.co ](https://routine.co)) is once more looking for OCaml developers.

Routine is a personal productivity assistant and knowledge manager. The technological stack revolves heavily around OCaml which
represents 80% of the codebase, both client and server side. The remaining 20% are the UIs in various frontend framework:
- Browser and desktop (Linux/Macos/Windows) through electron, using Js_of_ocaml (eyeing on WASM).
- iOS via Swift bindings.
- Android via JVM bindings (upcoming).

Our technological and academic background leads us to use designs that, I think, can pique the interest of seasoned Ocaml developer.
Amongst other things :

- Type-driven programming based on ppx derivers that produces typescript declaration for frontend bindings, JSON schema to expose and consume external REST APIs (Google, Notion, …), automatic SQL bindings, etc.
- Automatic API and foreign binding generation for the different front end technology, cross compilation.
- [Incremental ](https://github.com/janestreet/incremental) based state updates to refresh minimal subsets of the app.
- Integrated graph query language to query and manipulate all the app data, including defining custom data types and workflows.
- Highly concurrent implementation through Lwt and Eio - migrating to the later as we go. Exception-free design. OCaml 5 with all the goodies.
- Angstrom based parsing for the interactive console with highlighting and completion.
- Everything is very much library-oriented, with loads of reusable and scaffolded packages. Most of the work is intended to be open sources, or already has been published.
- An obsession for compile-time checks and type safety.

We use state of the art CI/CD and development processes. Salary is up to market standard depending on the profile, plus usual options
package, to be discussed. We have a preference for presential work in our Paris 11th office (Charonne, 3 days a week) to help foster
team spirit but we won't pass on talented remote individuals.

We're looking to extend the team with talented and passionate engineers who see the global picture and will work through all layers
of the project to see it succeed and create something we're proud of. While we expect great OCaml and general computer science
proficiency, we’re open to most levels of experience. Thoroughness and a love for well rounded, robust and beautiful software design
is a must have - but that comes bundled with OCaml love, right ?

Do not hesitate to reach out for any question here, at [quentin.hocquet@routine.co](mailto:quentin.hocquet@routine.co) or refer this
to someone who may be interested.

Thanks for your time and happy hacking !

      <cwn_title>dream-html 3.0.0</cwn_title>
      <cwn_url>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dream-html-3-0-0/14013/7</cwn_url>

[ANN] dream-html 3.3.1

Add ~to_xml~ and ~pp_xml~ functions to render in XML style

Normally, dream-html defaults to rendering nodes in HTML style, meaning that void elements are rendered just like opening tags. Eg
~&lt;br&gt;~. With the new ~to_xml~ and ~pp_xml~ functions, we can now render nodes in XML style, meaning ~&lt;br /&gt;~. This allows XML parsers
to successfully parse the output. So eg you can use dream-html to author an ePub book.

Escape URI attributes like ~href~ with normal attribute escaping rules in addition to percent-encoding. Most significantly,
ampersands are encoded now, eg ~/foo?a=1&amp;b=2~ is rendered as ~/foo?a=1&amp;amp;b=2~.

Change where line breaks are inserted into the output markup, so that there is no chance of injecting spurious whitespace into the
rendered page. This gives complete control over whitespace to the user.
