For anyone who is interested in commercial exploits using OCaml, we are 
releasing our first stand-alone sofware package, Presenta.

Presenta is an OpenGL-based slideshow presentation program with support for 
animated points, typeset mathematics, 2D and 3D graphics:

  <a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/presenta/">http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/presenta/</a>

The whole program is just under 10,000 LOC, entirely OCaml. The core of the 
program is a general purpose 2D vector graphics library (Smoke) which we've 
been developing for the past six years and which was translated from C++ into 
OCaml 2 years ago, with great success.

We currently support only x86 and AMD64 Linux but we are also considering 
supporting Mac OS X as well.

Let me know what you think! :)

&gt; For anyone who is interested in commercial exploits using OCaml, we are 
&gt; releasing our first stand-alone sofware package, Presenta.

Looks very cool! Btw, you don't need nVidia drivers, the free DRI-based
ones work very well (e.g. on my Intel i850 laptop).

I have now also a commercial product written in O'Caml: UMLMON, a
monitor for User Mode Linux. As I am mainly targeting the German market,
there is currently only documentation in German:
<a href="http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/umlmon">http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/umlmon</a> . An international version may follow
if there is enough interest.

UMLMON is a classic multiplexing daemon that starts and stops User Mode
Linux instances, manages a communications path with them, and does a
number of other nice things. Thanks O'Caml it has been developed within
six weeks, and is now practically bug-free. Show me another system
software developed that quickly.

You will need: ocamlsdl, lablgl, extlib and of course the ODE library
itself.  There's a (not very good) toy game in there too!

&gt; I'd like to create something that works like the format type for
&gt; format strings with Printf/Scanf. What I want to do is take a
&gt; one-dimensional bigarray, and a format string of all the sizes of the
&gt; fields corresponding to a struct, and return the typed results.
&gt; 
&gt; So sizes of 1 = bool, &lt;= 8 char/int (format specifier to choose char),
&gt; &lt;= 31 int/int32, = 32 int32, &gt; 32, int64.

The OCaml printf/scanf functions are basically hacks done in the
compiler.  Whereas it is possible to write a new function which takes
precisely the same string format as printf/scanf, it's not possible to
modify the format without changing the compiler.  However, see below ...

&gt; The idea is to make reading/writing C-like structs painless &amp;
&gt; automated. I'm just not sure where to begin in making this type-safe
&gt; format string. Does it require modding the ocaml parser &amp; libraries?
&gt; Cause I'm really confused how ocaml can statically parse the string
&gt; and enforce type safety without some hack in the compiler at some
&gt; stage.

It's actually a really good idea.

I can't see any immediate reason why it couldn't be done trivially
with camlp4.  For a good start, read Martin Jambon's camlp4 tutorial
(<a href="http://martin.jambon.free.fr/extend-ocaml-syntax.html">http://martin.jambon.free.fr/extend-ocaml-syntax.html</a>) and then have
a look at the code for tywith
(<a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/wiki/shifting_focus/tywith">http://www.seedwiki.com/wiki/shifting_focus/tywith</a>) and my old
simplesoap library (<a href="http://merjis.com/developers/simplesoap">http://merjis.com/developers/simplesoap</a>) which
both manipulate types from camlp4.

The xterm addicts in the audience may be interested in my calendar
application written in OCaml:

"Wyrd is a curses front-end for Remind, a powerful calendar and alarm
application. The display features a scrollable day calendar suitable for
visualizing your schedule at a glance. Wyrd integrates with an external
editor of your choice to make manual editing of reminder files more
efficient. Other features include significant configurability and
Mutt-like interface design."

As a side note, email to the Hump has been bouncing for a couple of
months now, as noted here:

Would be nice if someone looked into that...
