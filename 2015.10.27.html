I'm happy to announce the initial release of ocaml-dispatch:

<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-dispatch">https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-dispatch</a>

ocaml-dispatch provides a basic mechanism for dispatching a request to a
handler based on hierarchical path names conventionally found in URIs. It can
be used both for dispatching requests in a server, as well as handing changes
to hierarchical fragments in a client-side application via js_of_ocaml.

The code for this package originated from the webmachine[0] project. The
dispatch package is now a dependency of webmachine as of the 0.2.0 release.
You can find dispatch.0.1.0 in OPAM currently, and webmachine.0.2.0 there
shortly.

There are some small projects in the issue tracker if anybody would like to
contribute. Issues and pull requests welcomed.

I am looking for a self-contained, to the point, documentation or tutorial
detailing steps, or even commands and scripts to run in order to release and
publish an OCaml-programmed piece of software.

I guess it partly depends on one's way to develop and organize his or her code
base. Still I also guess there are common steps followed by a fair amount of
people.

As far as we are concerned for our project, we rely on OCaml code solely, plus
Opam-installed tools (e.g. Menhir) and libraries; plus Oasis and Ocamlbuild.
Our development is hosted on a Git repo.

So common tasks we'd like to automate are quite simple: adding the commit
number and/or a build number in the OCaml source code (e.g. to display it when
running the program), to display a git tag corresponding perhaps to
a human-readable version number, publishing the progam on Opam, maybe even
publishing a compiled version as a Debian package... As far as possible we'd
like to avoid reinventing the wheel as well as duplicating information already
present in a file (e.g. the _oasis file contains some data).

After some web searching, I was able to find real projects as examples as well
as some partial (good) tutorials but it would be nice if there was a single
documentation or bunch of scripts to address these rather common requirements.

This is not specific to Ocaml. It is a matter of build process.

Assuming a Linux system, you might have some rule in your Makefile similar to
the (untested) one below:

ML_SOURCES=$(wildcard [a-z]*.ml)
ML_INTERFACES=$(wildcard [a-z]*.mli)
MD5SUM= md5sum

_timestamp.ml:
    date +'let my_timestamp="%c";;' &gt; _timestamp.tmp

    (echo -n 'let my_lastgitcommit ="' ; \
       git log --format=oneline --abbrev=12 --abbrev-commit -q  \
         | head -1 | tr -d '\n\r\f\"' ; \
       echo '";;') &gt;&gt; _timestamp.tmp
    (echo -n 'let my_checksum ="'; cat $(sort $(ML_SOURCES)) $(sort
$(ML_INTERFACES))| $(MD5SUM) | cut -d' ' -f1 | tr -d '\n\r\f\"\\' ; echo '";')

i too would absolutely love to have something like numpy and something
like pandas in ocaml. the features i would want from ocaml-numpy are a
nice compact array slicing syntax, something like broadcasting, indexing
of arrays with int arrays or lists, and some magic that knows how to
choose the appropriate BLAS routines for common matrix operations. for a
pandas equivalent, flexible indexing would be the most important thing.
and printing a nice readable short output on screen with minimal effort.

I'm trying to create a "container" class[0] that can store a value of type 'a,
and transform that value to another value of type 'b. I'm trying to do this by
including a "map" method in the container that applies a function to the value
and returns a new instance of container with the transformed value. Despite
the annotations, the types aren't working out as I expected:

class ['a] container (v:'a) = object
method map (f:'a -&gt; 'b) : 'b container = new container (f v)
end;;
(* class ['a] container : 'a -&gt; object method map : ('a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a container

I gather I'm either doing something wrong, or it's not possible. I suppose my
question, which one is it? and if I'm doing something wrong, some guidance
would be appreciated. Thanks!

[0]: Note that this is a minimal, contrived example of my actual problem. The
actual problem came up while writing js_of_ocaml bindings.
      </pre><i>Jeremy Yallop replied:</i><br /><pre>
It's not exactly possible, but there are workarounds.

The reason the types don't work out as you expect is that structural
types (objects, classes, polymorphic variants) in OCaml are required
to be "regular".  A parameterised type t is regular if every
occurrence of t within its own definition is instantiated with the
parameters.  For example, the following type (t1) is regular:

   # type ('a, 'b) t1 = [`A of ('a, 'b) t1];;
     type ('a, 'b) t1 = [`A of ('a, 'b) t1]

but this one (t2) isn't, because the order of parameters is reversed

   # type ('a, 'b) t2 = [`A of ('b, 'a) t2];;
   Characters 5-38:
     type ('a, 'b) t2 = [`A of ('b, 'a) t2];;
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Error: In the definition of t2, type ('b, 'a) t2 should be ('a, 'b) t2
     type ('a, 'b) t2 = [`A of ('b, 'a) t2]

and this one (t3) isn't, either, because the parameters are
instantiated with concrete types

   # type ('a, 'b) t3 = [`A of (int, string) t3];;
   Characters 5-43:
     type ('a, 'b) t3 = [`A of (int, string) t3];;
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Error: In the definition of t3, type (int, string) t3 should be ('a, 'b) t3

As the output shows, OCaml rejects the non-regular definitions for t2
and t3.  Your example code also attempts to define a non-regular type,
but since the type variable 'b is available for unification, OCaml
doesn't need to reject the definition altogether.  Instead, 'b is
unified with the class parameter 'a to produce a regular type which is
acceptable to OCaml (but which doesn't do what you want).

How might we side-step the regularity constraint?  One approach is to
arrange things so that the recursion passes through a non-structural
type, such as a variant or record.  In an imaginary extension to OCaml
with support for groups of mutually-recursive types and classes we
could write something like this:

   class ['a] container (v:'a) = object
     method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b container_aux =
       fun f -&gt; { container = new container (f v) }
   end
   and 'a container_aux = { container: 'a container }

In today's OCaml we can achieve a similar effect by routing all the
recursive references through a recursive module, albeit at a rather
heavy syntactic cost:

   module rec R:
   sig
     class ['a] container : 'a -&gt;
       object
         method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b R.container_aux
       end
     type 'a container_aux = { container: 'a container }
   end =
   struct
     class ['a] container (v:'a) = object
       method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b R.container_aux =
         fun f -&gt; { R.container = new R.container (f v) }
     end
     type 'a container_aux = { container: 'a container }
   end

which at least achieves the desired effect:

   # let c = new R.container 3;;
   val c : int R.container = &lt;obj&gt;
   # (c#map string_of_int).R.container;;
   - : string R.container = &lt;obj&gt;
      </pre><i>Spiros Eliopoulos then said and Mikhail Mandrykin replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Thank, Jeremy, for the great explanation and possible work around.
&gt; Unfortunately for me, the workaround won't be possible to use for the
&gt; js_of_ocaml use case I have in mind. At least not without sprinkling
&gt; Obj.magic everywhere, which is what I'm trying to avoid.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on your workaround, I thought I might be able to create my own
&gt; workaround with code that looked something like this:
&gt; 
&gt;   module rec R : sig
&gt;     class type ['a] container1 = object
&gt;       method map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b R.container2
&gt;     end
&gt;     class type ['a] container2 = object
&gt;       method op : 'a R.container1
&gt;     end
&gt;   end = struct
&gt;     ...
&gt;   end
&gt; 
&gt; But of course the type system complained that:
&gt; 
&gt;   Error: In the definition of R.container2, type
&gt;        'b R.container1
&gt;        should be
&gt;        'a R.container1
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this might be for a different than the one you mentioned, but
&gt; upon further reflection and a single unrolling of the types, it seems to be
&gt; the regular type constraint that's causing this error as well.

It seems this is essentially not the workaround that was pointed out, as the 
suggestion was:
&gt;&gt; One approach is to
&gt;&gt; arrange things so that the recursion passes through a *non-structural
&gt;&gt; type*, such as a variant or record. 
And an object type 'a container2 is a structural type. As far as I understand, 
the semantics for type-checking of structural type abbreviations is the same 
as if all those abbreviations were expanded. So introducing a new class ['a] 
container2 doesn't help, because its corresponding object type ends up being 
expanded while type-checking ['a] container1 anyway and leads to essentially  
the same error. The regularity restriction seems to also arise from the same 
expansion semantics where we would need to infinitely expand the structural 
type abbreviation while checking itself and therefore would be unable to write 
recursive structural types altogether, but the issue is addressed by replacing 
the whole abbreviated type application with a type variable e.g. 'a container1 
= 'self and using this 'self in place of all regular self-references. Thus the 
type can remain structural (it's still possible to write it down without 
naming it)  despite the self-references e.g. ( &lt; get : 'a; map : 'self &gt; as 
'self). For irregular self-references this doesn't work (if 'a container = 
'self then what's 'b container or how to designate it to avoid infinite 
expansion?).

Just in case an another possible work-around would be to use an abstract type 
instead of a concrete nominal type as a proxy. This can be a little bit more 
suitable as an abstract type can be later bound to the same structural type 
and wrapping/unwrapping would become identity in the implementation. This is 
more heavyweight, though, e.g:

module type S = sig
  type 'a c'
  val new_c : 'a -&gt; 'a c'
end

module rec F' :
  functor (M : S) -&gt; sig
    class ['a] c : 'a -&gt; object
        method get : 'a
        method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b M.c'
      end
  end =
  functor (M : S) -&gt; struct
    class ['a] c (a : 'a) = object
      method get = a
      method map : 'b. (_ -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b M.c' = fun f -&gt; M.new_c (f a)
    end
  end

module rec F : sig
  type 'a c'
  class ['a] c : 'a -&gt; object
      method get : 'a
      method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b F.c'
    end
  val new_c : 'a -&gt; 'a F.c'
  val self_cast : 'a c' -&gt; 'a c
end = struct
  module F' = F'(F)
  class ['a] c = ['a] F'.c
  type 'a c' = 'a c
  let new_c a = new F.c a
  let self_cast (x : 'a c') = (x : 'a c)
end

let () =
  let c1 = new F.c 1 in
  Printf.eprintf "%d\n" c1#get;
  let c2 = F.self_cast @@ c1#map (string_of_int) in
  Printf.eprintf "%s\n" c2#get

Here F.self_cast is actually an identity function an is only used to help 
type-checking.
      </pre><i>Oleg also replied:</i><br /><pre>
The question was about creating a class of the following type

&gt;      class type ['a] container : 'a -&gt;
&gt;        object
&gt;          method map : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b container
&gt;        end

with a mapping method that makes a container of a different
type. Jeremy Yallop has explained very well the class of exactly such
type is not possible. The following is perhaps the simplest workaround
requiring neither modules nor other higher-class artillery. It should
have been possible even in OCaml 3.10 or earlier.

The idea was inspired by some high-falutin' Math, namely, left Kan
extension from Category Theory. I actually don't know CT but I think I
got the gist of the left Kan extension: rather than execute an an
operation, just collect all the needed arguments and declare the
operation performed. The recent paper on Freer monads (Haskell
Symposium 2015) used two instances of this new kind of laziness.

Here is the whole solution

    type 'a cont_proxy = P of 'a

    class ['a] container (x : 'a) = object
      method get_x = x
      method map' : 'b. ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b cont_proxy = fun f -&gt;
        P (f x)
    end

The class container has one argument, which is the value needed to
construct the container. The data type cont_proxy contains all the
information needed to construct the container, but not the container
itself (for one, the container type is not yet defined when we
declared P). The method map' doesn't actually construct anything; it
merely returns the data needed for the construction.

The map itself is then easy to define:

    let map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; ('a container -&gt; 'b container) = fun f c -&gt;
      match c#map' f with
        P x -&gt; new container x

let c = new container 3
    val c : int container = &lt;obj&gt;
let _ = c#get_x
    - : int = 3
let c' = map string_of_int c
    val c' : string container = &lt;obj&gt;
let _ = c'#get_x
    - : string = "3"

I'm happy to announce the latest release of dispatch. What's notable about
this release is that it includes out-of-the-box js_of_ocaml support.
Specifically, it allows you to easily set up front-end applications to use the
URI fragment to track state transitions and history. For example:

let fragment_thread = 
Dispatch_js.dispatch_on_fragment ~default:"/" [
("/" , root_handler)
; ("/user/:id/", user_handler)
]

... creates a thread that will monitor for URI fragment changes and dispatch
to the appropriate handler. In addition, it will set the initial fragment to
"/" and ensure that the handler for that path is initially called; even if the
fragment was already set to "/" when the thread started, dispatch will still
occur.

Due to the API changes included in this release, webmachine[0]'s version has
been bumped to 0.2.1. You can find both the new version of dispatch and
webmachine on OPAM.

As announced at the OCaml workshop last September, the development
sources for the core OCaml system are now hosted at Github,
ocaml/ocaml project.  (Before, this Github repository was a read-only
mirror of a master SVN repository hosted at Inria.)

Those of you who track the OCaml development version via SVN at
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/">http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/</a> should switch to Git at
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.git">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.git</a> instead.  The SVN repo remains
available for a few more weeks, but is no longer updated.
All other users should be unaffected by this change.
