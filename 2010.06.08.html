&gt; If I well understood what Alain Frisch and Xavier Leroy explained,
&gt; modules (including both structures and functors) become first class
&gt; value: structures may be converted to records and functors to functions;
&gt; and conversely. But I let more informed person confirm this.

Not really. What you describe is the internal compilation strategy for 
modules (structures -&gt; records; functors -&gt; functions), which did not 
change with the introduction of 1st class modules.

What's possible in OCaml 3.12 is to turn a module (be it a structure or 
a functor) into a "package", which is a first-class value. A package is 
just the wrapper around a module that makes it a first-class value. In 
particular, a package that wraps a structure (resp. a functor) is *not* 
converted to a record (resp. a function).

What you can with a package:
- whatever you can do with a first-class value (pass it to a function, 
store it in a data structure, etc);
- unwrap it back into the underlying module.


We've been using first-class modules for more than one year at LexiFi 
and we have never found a use for packing functors into first-class 
values, but I've no doubt people will find some. In particular, this 
allows the program to decide at runtime (given an environment variable 
or a command-line argument) to use some particular (functorized) 
implementation of a data structure over another.
      </pre><i>Eric Cooper asked and Alain Frisch replied:</i><br /><pre>
&gt; Is it possible to marshal and unmarshal these packages? 

Yes, this is possible, but:

1. Extremely dangerous: there is no runtime type-checking. If you 
marshal a module, you need to unmarshal it to the same package type, 
exactly (no coercion allowed). 

2. Rather useless: the code for functions within modules is not 
marshaled (as for regular functions). If you marshal a module that 
define functions, you need to unmarshal it in the same program. 

&gt; That might be a nice way to implement a plug-in architecture. 

Given the points above, I don't think so! 
      </pre><i>Jacques Garrigue then said:</i><br /><pre>
While marshalling of first-class modules is indeed not a good idea, I 
think that dynamic loading of first-class modules might provide a nice 
plug-in architecture. 
For instance, you can easily build a list of such plug-ins, with an 
uniform interface, and add elements to this list through dynamic 
loading. They can even expose internal data, with an abstract type. 

There is however a difficulty if you want to save and load data used 
by these plugins uniformly. Namely, even if all these plugins expose 
some data with a type "t", the "t" is actually going to be different 
in each, and the type system will enforce it. This is good, but it 
will be seen as different for the same plugin in a different run of 
the same application. So you need to do some standard hacking around, 
having unique ids for each plugin, and some magic to recover the data. 
Otherwise this seems a nice approach, easier than using objects, since 
objects don't let you expose internal data of different types. 
(Well, actually you can probably do this with objects too, using a 
polymorphic method to encoding existential types in CPS style, but 
this is going to be costly and not very natural.) 
      </pre><i>To which Alain Frisch replied:</i><br /><pre>

&gt; uniform interface, and add elements to this list through dynamic
&gt; loading. They can even expose internal data, with an abstract type.

Indeed!

That's basically our primary use of first-class modules at LexiFi. Our 
application maintains several sets of extensible notions (like 
"instruments" or "models") and it can load plugins which can register 
new such objects. Roughly speaking, each instrument is represented as a 
first-class module of type (module S) which looks like:

module type S = sig
   type t            (* the type of parameters for the instruments *)
   val t: t ttype    (* a dynamic representation of the type t *)
   val name: string  (* name to identify this instrument, presented
                        in a menu to the end-user *)
   val run: t -&gt; contract (* build a fresh contract, which is a notion 
independent from the instrument *)

   type attrs   (* the type of attributes for this instrument *)
   val attrs: attrs ttype (* dynamic representation of attrs *)
   val compute: t -&gt; contract -&gt; attrs (* calculate attributes
                                    from initial parameters and
                                    a contract with history *)

   (* ... *)
end


The idea is that each instrument defines a number of abstract types 
(parameters, attributes) and operations on these types. It also exports 
values that gives the concrete structural representation of these 
abstract types (the 'a ttype components above) to enable generic 
operations such as automatic generation of GUI for showing/editing 
values of these types, or safe marshaling.  These "type" values can be 
derived automatically from the actual type definitions (either with a 
syntax extension, or with a compiler modification in our case).

</h3><p>Archive: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/dcd9b17d49310b43#">http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/dcd9b17d49310b43#</a></p><i>Vincent Rahli announced:</i><br /><pre>
We are happy to announce the release of the version 0.5 of our type
error slicing software for the SML programming language.

Major improvements over the previous release:
  * Handling of the SML 'open' feature.
  * Handling of the SML datatype replication feature.
  * Type error slices can now be displayed in a terminal window or in
    a web browser.
  * We supply Ubuntu and Fedora packages.

Other less important improvement is:
  * We improved our minimisation algorithm.

Even more changes are documented in the ChangeLog file.

The aim of our type error slicer is to provide useful type error
reports for pieces of code written in SML:
  * It identifies all of the program points that contribute to a type
    error, including the spot with the actual programming error that
    caused the type error.
  * It highlights these program points in the original, unchanged
    source code.
  * It avoids showing internal details of the operation of the type
    inference machinery.

New Ubuntu (Debian based) and Fedora (Red-Hat based) packages of our
type error slicer can be found at this URL:
  <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/compositional-analysis/type-error-slicing/">http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/compositional-analysis/type-error-slicing/</a>

We will also shortly release a plain archive of our type error
slicer.

At the time of the release of version 0.4, we forgot to update the web
demo.  We have now updated our web demo from version 0.3 to version 0.5.

Known limitations:
  * We have not yet built the software for other operating systems
    than Linux.
  * The currently supported user interfaces are via a terminal window,
    GNU Emacs (or our web demo).  We are currently developing a Vim
    interface.
  * Some type errors are not yet discovered (the user will need to
    rely on their usual type checker in these cases).  Notable spots
    where the implementation is incomplete are functors (you can work
    around this by including signatures on functor applications),
    equality types.
  * Concerning fixity declarations, programs are parsed as though the
    declarations were not there, which gives wrong results.
  * We don't yet handle overloaded constants (for example 1 is always
    of type int).
  * The details of the SML basis library are incomplete (fortunately
    the user can add any additional details they are using).
  * The software does not currently scale well to very large programs
    (we are still improving this).  It is currently suitable for small
    programs and use in teaching.
  * We do not report free identifiers anymore.
  * We have some known issues ';' that can lead to incorrect
    constraint generations and so to wrong type error messages.  We
    are currently working on a new version of the slicer that will fix
    this issue.
