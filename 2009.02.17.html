&gt; Hi all, 

&gt; I'm looking for a tool that will take an XML data schema (.xsd) and 
&gt; generate data bindings in Ocaml. In other words, I am seeking an Ocaml 
&gt; equivalent to XSD (for C and C++) and JAXB (for Java). 

&gt; Googling didn't immediately turn up anything meeting the above 
&gt; description. I'd very much appreciate any pointers. 

I think you can try taking a look at two project: 
<a href="http://www.galaxquery.org/">http://www.galaxquery.org/</a> 
<a href="http://www.cduce.org/ocaml">http://www.cduce.org/ocaml</a> 

I think they implement something close to what you want (I mean "close", 
not "what you want" unfortunately). At least there is some code in it, 
that deal with xsd.

XSD as in the crazy-complicated quasi-standard used in SOAP, WSDL etc? 
I'm not sure you'll find any implementations in OCaml - it's hard 
enough to implement when you have a large team of people available to 
you. 

I did a very very partial implementation using CDuce as part of my 
SOAP client code for the Google AdWords API.  It's not directly 
usable, but maybe you can have a look at it for inspiration anyway:

I've just uploaded findlib-1.2.4. This is a bugfix release:

     * For ocaml-3.11 some camlp4 libs no longer include dynlink.
       Findlib has a fixed META definition.
     * Bigarray needs unix: This has been fixed in the META file, too.
     * Attempt to fix some "space path" issues for Win32. It is
       untested, however.

Get findlib from its homepage
(<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html</a>). The GODI package
is already updated.
