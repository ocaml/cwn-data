** IndiscriminateCoding asked


Is there any production-ready implementation of [[http://raft.github.io][Raft consensus protocol]] in OCaml?
There is [[https://github.com/heidi-ann/ocaml-raft][ocaml-raft]], which does have a technical paper, but it looks abandoned and it's not even in opam repository.

** IndiscriminateCoding then said


Thanks! First project seems abandoned too (and doesn't have license specified), but second looks promising. Will have a closer look at it.

** Andrew Tongen announced


As a learning project, I decided to implement the game of [[https://www.setgame.com/][Set]] entirely in ocaml/reason:

Game: https://setml.andrewtongen.net/\\
Code: https://github.com/atongen/setml

There are separate modules for frontend and backend code, with shared modules in between. Overall, I really enjoyed this exercise. The ocaml type system is truly amazing, and I will definitely look for more ways to use it in the future.

The game itself has not be thoroughly tested on various devices, but it seems to work pretty well on newish android and apple devices.

Check it out and let me know what you think!

I've been super busy for a while, but here's the blog post:

(And the code I was working on when I wrote this will show up in our Mssql library as soon as I have time)
