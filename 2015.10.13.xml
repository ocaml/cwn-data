      <cwn_what>
Recently the topic was discussed here and several testing frameworks were
mentionned.

I am wondering whether there are well established projects that actually
use tests (unit tests and others) and that could be used as sources of
inspiration?

In batteries there are:

Look for $T in the file for unit tests.
Or $Q for tests a la Haskell quickcheck.

      <cwn_who>Gabriel Scherer also replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
Batteries uses a lot of tests, and we couldn't live without them.

In particularly, they make maintainer's life much easier (it's easier to make
the decision to integrate code when, besides being nice to read, it is also
well-tested), and that is key in a project with many small contributions, so a
lot of integration work. It is mandatory for new functions proposed for
inclusions to come with unit tests, which means that new code has more tests
than old code (inherited from Extlib, with no tests). I would say that it is
the most noticeable impact of tests: smoothing the code contribution and
reviewing workflow.

I suspect the benefits of testing may be easier to reap for library-style
projects (adapted to unit-testing) rather than final-executable-project (with
more complex specification and more integration testing to do). But, in any
case, all projects have a library part.

# Batteries' example: qtest/iTeml

A representative of "new code" would be batSubString.ml for example:
https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included/blob/master/src/batSubstring.ml

As you can see, the tests are placed inside the modules, close to the
implementation. The tool we use for that was initially created by Ilmari
Heikkinen (for his Prelude.ml), lived inside Batteries for a long time, and
was extracted as a separate project by Vincent Hugo, it is now called iTeML
and found at
https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML

(It is completely independent from Batteries and everyone is encouraged to
have a look.)

The particular way it works is by extracting tests found in comments with a
special marking (typically "(*$T", other modifiers also exist). Vincent Hugo
wrote an excellent documentation:
https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML#introduction

# Test extraction tools, and testing libraries

Other projects have their own preprocessing tools to manipulate tests. I don't
have exhaustive knowledge of what is out there, but there is Jun Furuse's
ppx_test (on top of the oUnit library). there is pa_ounit (
https://github.com/janestreet/pa_ounit ), and Janestreet also has pa_test and
a PPX successor (also named ppx-test, I would guess). pa_ounit is the best
documented of these projects, as it describes the execution model.

I strongly believe that "text extraction" preprocessors and "
{random,unit,mock,...}testing libraries" are orthogonal components that should
be developped separately and combined together by user.
In practice Batteries uses oUnit for unit testing, and the "quickcheck"
library embedded inside qtest/iteml for random testing, but I've also had good
experiences with Xavier Clerc's Kaputt on other projects (
http://kaputt.x9c.fr/ ).

In practice I would say that, in my experience, for unit testing, the
unit-testing library doesn't actually matter that much: you need some kind of
"test : bool -&gt; ..." function and decent text reporting capabilities (telling
you which tests failed). Simple boolean tests already provide a lot of
benefits to library projects, and the other bells and whistles (support for
automatically printing values, HTML reporting and what not) may help in
particular scenarios but there is a diminishing return much. (Random-testing
is harder to do really well and you will be more heavily dependent on the
library used.)

# Test extraction actually matters

I think that the ability to write *inline* tests, which I initially thought to
be mere syntactic sugar, is actually really important. They help giving the
programmer the (right) idea that the function *comes with* its test, and
improves locality of code modification. When refactoring a function or
whatever: you may already be annoyed by having to modify the .mli separately,
don't have tests cost you a third file to update. Plus reading the .mli in
isolation brings some value, tests not so much.

There are two broad families of "test extraction techniques":
[internal]: compile the module with or without tests; during test run, just
load the compiled-with-tests module
[external]: put the extracted tests in a separate file; the module is always
compiled without tests, and the separate test part is compiled for test runs

qtest/iTeML is currently using the external model. On paper the internal one
is more powerful, as it allows you to test internal functions not exported
through the interface (external tests have to respect the abstraction
boundary), and facilitates testing functors -- I would assume that some of the
other extraction tools use the internal model. We have discussed moving iTeML
to the internal model in the past, but nobody has committed to doing the work
for now, and I think the benefits for Batteries specifically wouldn't actually
be that big -- but it may be specific to the fact that the project is *a*
library, and thus has much more exposed than private functions.
(The internal model also raises the not-quite-trivial issues of either
interleaving test-registration side-effects throughout your (otherwise pure,
right?) code, urgh, or trying to have a value-driven approach which implies
non-trivial data-passing plumbing.)

the "ounit" as it's not using ounit at all

already taked and was a bit too generic anyway

libguestfs tools have extensive tests.

We have a few unit tests, using OUnit2.  An example:

https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/v2v/v2v_unit_tests.ml

But the vast majority of the upstream tests use automake's (terrible)
test framework, eg:

https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/v2v/Makefile.am#L239
https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/builder/Makefile.am#L224
https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/blob/master/resize/Makefile.am#L130

We also have external tests that are non-free so can't be distributed
with the upstream sources:

http://git.annexia.org/?p=virt-v2v-test-cases-nonfree.git;a=summary

We also have a public CI system:

https://ci.centos.org/view/libguestfs/

And finally, we use some proprietary software called Polarion to track
a massive set of tests (many run manually) that control what gets into RHEL.
Those tests aren't published at all.

      <cwn_what>
(Editor note: See the archive link above for the attached files.)
        
currently I'm trying to add OCaml to the openwrt router distribution [1] [2].
This would mean you could run your favorite OCaml applications on your router.
I would like to run unison [3] on my router.

So I first build native OCaml 4.02.3 on my x86_64 linux host, and then build a
OCaml cross-compiler for the 32 bit target, e.g. mips-openwrt-linux. Building
OCaml went fine after adding a small patch to manually set Endianness and
Bitness in configure script, please have a look at attached patch.

host OCaml configure line:
./configure -prefix somepath -no-pthread -no-debugger -no-ocamldoc -no-graph -
no-cfi
cross OCaml configure line:
./configure -prefix someotherpath -target-bindir /usr/bin -host
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -target mips-openwrt-linux-musl -cc
"mips-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc some target cflags" -as
"mips-openwrt-linux-musl-as some target as flags" -no-pthread -no-shared-libs -
no-debugger -no-ocamldoc -no-graph -no-cfi -big-endian

Now the bug: When running OCaml applicantions (build with -custom), they crash
on startup on the target:

Fatal error: exception Failure("input_value: integer too large")

This is similar to OCaml Bug #5977 [4]

There is a workaround:
Build the host OCaml as 32 bit OCaml, then build the cross compiler with this
32 bit host OCaml. The resulting binaries work on the target.
This is what I did for openwrt [2], but it fails on 64 bit hosts where no 32
bit development tools are installed. It only catches the case when building on
x86_64 hosts, it will break when building on say powerpc64 or 64 bit arm. It's
also problematic for openwrt, as only the cross compiler but not the host
tools are recompiled if the target arch changes, e.g. from 64 bit arm to 32
bit mips.

Now my questions:
- Is building a 32 bit cross compiler on a 64 bit host supposed to work?
- Is my patch to configure ok, or is there a better way to configure the
cross-compiler?
- Should I run some test suite on the target and post the results?

[WARNING] Something went wrong while checking native division and modulus
please report it at http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/
Do I have to care?
I tried defining and undefining NONSTANDARD_DIV_MOD in m.h. without any
visible difference. Running the test-prog divmod.c on a few targets always
returns 0.

      <cwn_who>Nicolas Ojeda Bar replied and Gerd Stolpmann said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; I believe it is currently impossible to build a working cross-compiler
&gt; between different word sizes, as the compiler does not differentiate
&gt; between the host and the target's native integers.

Correct, it's unsupported. Unfortunately, there is no check in the
configure script whether the word sizes match (it only checks for the
OCaml version).

It's not only the value marshaller that can fail, but I've also seen
illegal assembler code. The core of the problem is that the generic parts
of the native-code backend use nativeint for integer calculations, and the
code emitters for 32 bit platforms then just assume nativeint has only 32
bits. I guess the solution would be to introduce a new integer type
targetint into the compiler that is either int32 or int64, depending on
what the cross-compile target is.
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Stefan Hellermann then said and Adrien Nader replied</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; So I think I have to build a 32 bit and a 64 bit host OCaml and select the
&gt; right one when building a cross-compiler.

I faced a similar issue with luajit recently. Except that for luajit it
is completely hopeless. Absolutely completely hopeless.

I would expect some things to have already been done for luajit in
openwrt and would advise you to check there. I forgot to look at it
myself.

What I'm currently doing is to setup a small private toolchain based on
a static musl for the libc, libfirm/cparser for the C compiler, pcc-libs
for the C runtime and binutils (cparser is a single multi-target binary
that knows how to invoke binutils properly across archs). Obviously I'm
not entirely happy with that but in practice it doesn't need much more
CPU time and it should just work (I haven't packaged it fully yet but I
can't think of possible issues there).

&gt; I sent a patch series which changes the way the configure script checks for
&gt; pointer sizes and endianess. Is this okay? It should work for all native
&gt; and cross compilation cases. Can you test and comment on them? These are
&gt; the only patches I need against OCaml to make it usable on openwrt.

I haven't checked your pull request in details but the approach
(complemented with XL's input in particular) seemed good to me. In any
case, I am sorry that I forgot the check about endianness or more
probably (it's been some time already) that I thought I would be able to
solve the incompatibility itself quite quickly. Thanks for fixing that
and adding one. :)

&gt; I the following example (boiled down from a real use case):
&gt; 
&gt; type _ elem =
&gt;  | Int: int elem
&gt; 
&gt; let rec incr: type a. a elem -&gt; a -&gt; int = function
&gt;  | Int -&gt; fun i -&gt; add i 1
&gt; and add n m = n + m
&gt; 
&gt; I get the error (Ocaml 4.02.3):
&gt; File "example.ml", line 5, characters 24-25:
&gt; Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
&gt;         int
&gt;       This instance of int is ambiguous:
&gt;       it would escape the scope of its equation

Interesting error.
I see your confusion in seeing an error on ‘i’.

It is not completely wrong as you can indeed fix it by adding a local type
annotation changing the type of ‘i’ from ‘a’ to ‘int’.

&gt; I can get rid of the error by annotating the type of i in line 5 like this:
&gt; 
&gt; | Int -&gt; fun (i : int) -&gt; add i 1
&gt;                   ^^^

However, the real cause is not so much ‘i', whose type is indeed known (but as
`a’, not `int’), but rather the absence of type annotation on ‘add'.
Changing add in the following way fixes the problem:

  and add : int -&gt; int -&gt; int = fun n m -&gt; n + m

&gt; Or move add above incr like this:
&gt; 
&gt; let rec add n m = n + m
&gt; and incr: type a. a elem -&gt; a -&gt; int = function
&gt;  | Int -&gt; fun i -&gt; add i 1

This change of order only works by chance. If you use ocaml -principal, you still get
a type error here with this code.

&gt; Is there an explanation to why I need to give the type of i in this case? As
&gt; 'i' _must_ be an int (from the type annotation of incr), annotating the
&gt; function seems ambiguous.


If you look carefully, you will see that the annotation says that ‘i’ has type
‘a’, not ‘int’. In the local scope, those two types are equivalent, but once
you leave if they are different. Since we do not know yet the type of add,
making a choice between the two seems arbitrary, hence the error message.

The only conclusive source on how this works is my paper with Didier Rémy:
	Ambivalent types for principal type inference with GADTs
	http://pauillac.inria.fr/~remy/gadts/

In a nutshell, ambiguity occurs when a type obtained by unifying two
equivalent (but different) types is leaked out of their equivalence scope.
What happens here is a bit complicated. First the typer tries to give the type
[a -&gt; int -&gt; int] to `add', avoiding ambivalence. However, `a’ is not
allowed to leak out of the definition of `incr’, so it gets expanded into
`int’. And this is that expansion which triggers the ambiguity error. (An
interesting remark is that, since add cannot have type [a -&gt; int -&gt; int]
anyway, there seems to be no ambiguity here. However, there is a scope between
the definition of `incr’ and the pattern-matching on `Int’ where such
ambiguity might exists.) By adding a local annotation on `i’, the problem is
avoided, because then we are assuming that `add’ has type [int -&gt; int -&gt;
int] from the beginning (the ambivalence on `i’ does not leak). Same thing
with adding an annotation on `add’.

As specific remark on what happens when you change the order
(without -principal): Since add is typed first, and receives type [int -&gt;
int -&gt; int], this type is handled as though it was explicitly known when
entering the gadt scope. This is done for the type of all external
identifiers, except for their non-generalized type variables. As a result, you
get the same behavior as adding a type annotation on add.

Thank you for this very demonstrative example.
      </cwn_what>
      <cwn_who>Anders Peter Fugmann then replied and Jacques Garrigue said</cwn_who>
      <cwn_what>
&gt; Thanks for detailed explanation. I think I understand now why the error
&gt; occurs and more specifically how to fix it in a consistent way.
&gt; 
&gt; (However, changing 'add' to be
&gt; 'add': int -&gt; int -&gt; int = fun n m-&gt; n + m
&gt; does not seem to help in my case)

Interesting.
This appears to be a rare case where it types with -principal, but not without it.
This is bug. I shall investigate it.

I made a setup to boot a raspberry pi 2 directly into the OCaml system. The
focus was to use the minimal amount of assembly and C to be able to call
`caml_startup` and let the rest up to you — there's an example Rpi module for
the boring bits if you are lazy. The overall boot code is very small for now
but some more may be needed in the future to enable other hardware features;
mmu, interrupts, multicore etc. or things I overlook — all this was done with
a high degree of naïvety…

I hope this can make it an easy and reproducible starting point for others to
have some bare metal programming fun in their preferred system language. This
is available here:

  http://erratique.ch/software/rpi-boot-ocaml

Follow the instructions in the linked README, they should lead you to build
a kernel displaying the OCaml logo on the connected display and communicating
boring dot poetry over the serial connection.

The setup builds a bare ARMv7 OCaml cross compiler inside an opam switch by
following the tracks of the opam-android project [1]. Now to scale and and
make it a pleasant programming experience we "only" need multiarch support in
opam switches and fix the package's build systems and merlin to understand
these environments.

The project also has a minimal libc with only what's needed to run the OCaml
system on a bare machine. It will be eventually forked away and distributed as
a separate package (n.b. it seems to currently have a few quirks with the
snprintf implementation I stole from somewhere else).

Best,

Daniel

It's my pleasure to announce the release of cmdliner 0.9.8. The main
highlights of this release are:

* Bring back support for OCaml 3.12.0
* Support for pre-formatted paragraphs in man pages. Thanks to Guillaume Bury 
  for suggesting and help.

* Support for environment variables and their documentation. If an argument is absent 
  from the command line, its value can be read and parsed from an environment variable.

These additions may break existing programs but they likely won't, see the
release notes for details. There are a few other minor things, the full
release notes are available here:

      <cwn_what>
&gt; is there some "official" way to detect -- from C -- if OCaml was
&gt; compiled for 32 or 64 bit?
&gt; I'd love to have something like a #define that either says 32 or 64
&gt; bit;
&gt; I need to know at compile time if the OCaml system uses 31 or 63 bit
&gt; sized integers (in the C code).
&gt; I don't care what the underlying OS or hardware does, but just what
&gt; OCaml is using.
&gt; 
&gt; Btw.: Is [Sys.word_size = 32] for 32 bit OCaml compilers on 64 bit
&gt; machines?

I believe config.h has the info you want:
  #define ARCH_SIXTYFOUR // for instance

Note how it's installed under $(libdir) and not $(includedir): its
content is set at configure-time and depends on the architecture that
