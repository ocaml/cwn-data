  Fixed some bugs in the Godot OCaml bindings I'm working on.  Here is a
  blog post that could be of interest if you're looking to dive into
  them, or using Ctypes in another project, or are writing Godot
  bindings for another language, or just have some time to
  kill. :smiley:

opam 2.2.0 is out!

Kate announced

  We’re very happy to finally announce the release of opam 2.2.0.


What’s new?
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • *Windows support* :window: :tada: (you can hear all about it in the
     [blog post])
  • `opam tree' / `opam why': new commands showing a tree view of the
    given packages and their dependencies and reverse-dependencies,
    respectively.
  • `with-dev-setup': a new variable and argument to install the
    recommend developement setup for a local project.
  • `opam pin --recursive' and `--subpath' to have opam look at opam
    files elsewhere than the root directory of a project.
  • `opam switch -' to go back to the previous global switch (inspired
    by `git switch -')
  • `opam pin --current' fixes a package to its current state (disabling
    pending reinstallations or removals from the repository)
  • `opam pin remove --all' removes all the pinned packages from a
    switch
  • `opam exec --no-switch' removes the opam environment when running a
    command. It is useful when you want to launch a command without opam
    environment changes.
  • `opam clean --untracked' removes untracked files interactively
    remaining from previous packages removal.
  • `opam admin add-constraint <cst> --packages pkg1,pkg2,pkg3' applies
    the given constraint to a given set of packages
  • `opam list --base' has been renamed into `--invariant', reflecting
    the fact that since opam 2.1 the "base" packages of a switch are
    instead expressed using a switch invariant
  • `opam install --formula <formula>' installs a formula instead of a
    list of packages. This can be useful if you would like to install
    one package or another one. For example `opam install --formula
    '"extlib" | "extlib-compat"'' will install either `extlib' or
    `extlib-compat' depending on what's best for the current switch.
  • and many other features, performance improvements and fixes

  :open_book: You can read our [blog post] for more information about
  these changes and a lot more.

How to upgrade
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  In case you plan a possible rollback, you may want to first backup
  your

  `~/.opam' or `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\opam' directory.

  The upgrade instructions are unchanged:

  For Unix systems

  ┌────
  │ bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh) --version 2.2.0"
  └────

  or from PowerShell for Windows systems

  ┌────
  │ Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.ps1) }"
  └────

  or download manually from [the Github "Releases" page] to your PATH.

  You should then run:

  ┌────
  │ opam init --reinit -ni
  └────

  Welcome to the June 2024 edition of the OCaml.org newsletter! This
  update has been compiled by the OCaml.org team. You can find [previous
  updates] on Discuss.

  Our goal is to make OCaml.org the best resource for anyone who wants
  to get started and be productive in OCaml. The OCaml.org newsletter
  provides an update on our progress towards that goal and an overview
  of the changes we are working on.

  We couldn't do it without all the amazing people who help us review,
  revise, and create better OCaml documentation and work on issues. Your
  participation enables us to so much more than we could just by
  ourselves. Thank you!

  This newsletter covers:
  • *Recipes for the OCaml Cookbook:* Help us make the OCaml Cookbook
     really useful by contributing and reviewing recipes for common
     tasks!
  • *Community & Marketing Pages Rework:* Implementation work in
     progress.
  • *General Improvements:* As usual, we also worked on general
     maintenance and improvements, so we're highlighting some of the
     work that happened below.

Recipes for the OCaml Cookbook
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The OCaml Cookbook is a place where OCaml developers share how to
  solve common tasks using packages from the ecosystem.

  A recipe is a code sample and explanations on how to perform a task
  using a combination of open-source libraries.

  The Cookbook is live at [ocaml.org/cookbook].

  Here's how you can help:

  1. Review, then [open pull requests for cookbook recipes]!
  2. Contribute new recipes and tasks for the cookbook!

General Improvements and Data Additions
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  *Summary:*

  • To reduce repetition of the module interface definitions relating to
    `ood-gen' (the tool that turns the files in the `data/' folder into
    OCaml modules), types have been factored out. This hopefully makes
    it simpler to contribute to changes to the data models.
  • Materials for some of the tutorials have been published under the
    <https://github.com/ocaml-web> GitHub organisation: [“Your First
    OCaml Program”], [“Modules”], [“Functors”], and [“Libraries With
    Dune”].
  • The OCamlFormat version used to format the project is now 0.26.2.

ocaml-libbpf: Libbpf C-bindings for OCaml
═════════════════════════════════════════

Lee Koon Wen announced

  I'm excited to announce the first release of ocaml-libbpf, a new
  library providing OCaml bindings for libbpf, the essential C library
  for working with eBPF programs. This library allows you to load,
  initialize, link, and manage eBPF programs within OCaml, simplifying
  the process of working with these powerful in-kernel applications.

  ┌────
  │ opam install libbpf
  └────

  Key Features:
  • High-level and Low-level APIs: Access both raw bindings and
    user-friendly high-level functions for eBPF management.
  • Seamless Integration: Load eBPF ELF files into the kernel with ease.
  • BPF Map Support: Manage BPF maps for communication between user
    space and kernel space.

  For more information, visit the [ocaml-libbpf] repo. Contributions and
  feedback are welcome!

  Enjoy!

How I built the Acutis template language in OCaml

  Acutis is a personal project I've been developing on-and-off over the
  last few years. It's a template language (similar to Mustache,
  Nunjucks, etc.) that has a static type system, uses pattern-matching,
  and can compile templates into JavaScript files. I'm sharing it now
  because it's reached a somewhat-stable state.

  [You can view its home page here] and [its source code here]. I also
  wrote a blog-style article that explains how I created Acutis, the
  problems I faced, and the decisions I made. You can read it here:
  "[The Acutis template language, or: how I over-engineered a program
  that just prints text]".

  I don't especially expect people to use Acutis much, since it's very
  personal and based around my specific use cases. (Also, we have an
  overabundance of template languages already anyway.) Nonetheless,
  building it was a fun and rewarding learning experience for
  me. Perhaps some people will find it as interesting as I did. 🙂
