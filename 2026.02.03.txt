Ofortune!
═════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ofortune/17744/1>


Tim ats announced
─────────────────

  Hi everyone,

  I'm very glad to announce the release of [Ofortune]! Ofortune is a
  fortune-teller written in OCaml. For those who didn't know, `fortune'
  is a small NetBSD utility which, according to its [man page], "prints
  a random, hopefully interesting, adage".

  <https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex020/uploads/ocaml/original/2X/c/ced911b15beffb91c8d906e073eef707bb722f2b.gif>

  Even though the goal of Ofortune is not to behave exactly like the
  legacy implementation, it shares most of the same command-line
  flags. By default, Ofortune searches fortune files in the directory
  `/usr/share/games/fortune', but you may directly set the files used to
  pick a random fortune (with eventually an associated probability) by
  doing the following `ofortune 60% quotations 40% funny-quotations'.

  I think that ofortune is one of those software programs that is
  moderately interesting unless you give it an excellent database to
  work with, so feel free to write your own cookie files. Your can for
  you can place it in your bashrc file to display a random quote each
  time you open a terminal.

  Ofortune is written in dependance free OCaml > 5.4. To install it,
  type (this will install an executable named `ofortune' in your path):
  ┌────
  │ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~tim-ats-d/ofortune && cd ofortune && make native && install -T ofortune_unix.native /bin/ofortune
  └────

  An online version compiled with js_of_ocaml is available at this
  address: <https://site.condor-du-plateau.fr/ofortune-web.html>.

  Ofortune is distributed under the LGPL-3.0 license, and the source
  code is available [here].

OUPS meetup february 2026
═════════════════════════

ancolie announced
─────────────────

  The next OUPS meetup will take place on *Wednesday, 25th of February*
  2026. It will start at *6:30pm* at the *4 place Jussieu* in Paris. It
  will be in the in the *Esclangon building* (amphi Astier).

  Please, *[register on meetup ]* as soon as possible to let us know how
  many pizza we should order.

  For more details, you may check the [OUPS’ website ].

  Moreover, we’d like to announce that the organizing team moved to the
  [OCaml Zulip]. Feel free to contact us there if you’d like to suggest
  talks.

  —

  This time we’ll have the following talks:

  *Coccinelle, for C and for Rust – Julia Lawall*

        Coccinelle is a tool for automating complex repetitive
        searches and transformations in source code. It was
        originally developed for the C language, targetting the
        Linux kernel, but we have recently started working on
        Rust. This talk will give an overview of Coccinelle
        targeting C, present the main design decisions and how
        they translate to Rust, and present some practical
        examples involving Rust. Both versions of Coccinelle are
        available in open source.

        • <https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/>
        • <https://rust-for-linux.com/coccinelle-for-rust>

  *OCaml and the MOPSA static analysis platform – Marco Milanese*

        In this talk we present MOPSA, a static analysis platform
        built in OCaml: MOPSA implements a sound analysis (based
        on the theory of abstract interpretation), with an
        emphasis on reusability and modularity of abstractions.

        To this end each domain performs a simple, targeted,
        simplification of the program and it can be swapped or
        combined with other domains to tune the
        precision/performance tradeoff of the analysis.  OCaml and
        its type and module systems play a crucial role to achieve
        this goal.. we will see how monads, modules and abstract
        data types (and more!) naturally describe the components
        of a static analysis tool.

  —

  After the talks there will be some pizzas offered by the [OCaml
  Software Foundation] and later on we’ll move to a pub nearby as usual.

shakuhachi v0.2.0
═════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-shakuhachi-v0-2-0/17751/1>


EruEri announced
────────────────

  I'm happy to announce the release [shakuhachi v0.2.0].  Shakuhachi is
  a music collection manager. It aims to be a rather simple collection
  manager extensible by plugins.

  This release is mostly a bug-fix release, but some new functions are
  exposed through its API.

  Sincerely yours.

OCaml security grants
═════════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ocaml-security-grants/17754/1>


Hannes Mehnert announced
────────────────────────

  Dear OCaml hackers,

  we're pleased to announce that there are grants (up to 100_000 EUR)
  available for the broad topic of OCaml and security. The main idea is
  to strengthen the OCaml ecosystem in terms of security - being it
  tooling, documentation, guides, ….

  Your submitted proposal (until March 1st) will be reviewed by the
  OCaml security team (<https://ocaml.org/security>). This wouldn't be
  possible with the OCSF (<https://ocaml-sf.org/>) and their sponsors.

  If you have an idea, please go to
  <https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/ozl80ZB3ndLhMcGeu0buygGOIwZWL6+dxbPuXgT+Wxs/>
  and submit your proposal.


  Thanks,

  Hannes (in the name of the OCaml security team)


New release of Menhir (20260122)
════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-new-release-of-menhir-20260122/17764/1>


François Pottier announced
──────────────────────────

  I am pleased to announce a new version of Menhir.

  ┌────
  │ opam update && opam install menhir.20260122
  └────

  The main new feature is a brand new GLR back-end. This back-end is
  selected by the command line switch `--GLR'. GLR is a
  non-deterministic parsing algorithm; it is useful when the grammar
  lies outside the class LR(1), either because the grammar is
  unambiguous but requires more than one token of lookahead, or because
  the grammar is truly ambiguous. For more information on GLR, please
  [read the manual].

  There are also many minor changes in this release; please see [the
  change log] for details.

  Happy parsing,

  François.

OCaml for Industry
══════════════════

  Archive: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ocaml-for-industry/17766/1>


Nicolas Ojeda Bar announced
───────────────────────────

  Dear community,

  This Friday, Feb 6 at 15:00-17:00 CET the OCSF is organizing a video
  call in collaboration with Tarides and OCamlPro to discuss all aspects
  of OCaml relevant to __industrial__ users. We have invited all OCSF
  sponsors to participate, but would be very happy to welcome other
  industrial users (who are not currently OCSF sponsors) if they want to
  participate.

  So, if you are an industrial user of OCaml and would like to
  participate, please get in touch and I will forward the meeting
  details.

  Thanks!

  Cheers, Nicolas


Mset 0.2.0 - new library for small multisets
════════════════════════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/mset-0-2-0-new-library-for-small-multisets/17769/1>


Jean Christophe Filliatre announced
───────────────────────────────────

  Dear OCaml community,

  I’m pleased to announce the first release of `mset', a library that
  implements multisets as soon as they are small enough to fit inside a
  single `int' (as a bitset).

  It is available via `opam' and here at GitHub:

  • [https://github.com/backtracking/mset]
  • [documentation]

  I implemented this library as part of a project to [count anagrams]
  but I anticipate it might be useful for other purposes.

  Happy hacking,

  Jean-Christophe

Lwt.6.1.0, Lwt_ppx.6.1.0
════════════════════════

  Archive:
  <https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-lwt-6-1-0-lwt-ppx-6-1-0/17770/1>


Raphaël Proust announced
────────────────────────

  *Lwt.6.1.0* has been release. It contains some fixes (see full
   [changelog], special thanks to @kit-ty-kate and @otini) as well as
   the following notable addition:

  • New `Lwt_engine.engine_id' to know what underlying engine Lwt is
    currently using.

  *Lwt_ppx.6.1.0* (also *Lwt_ppx.5.9.3*) has been released. It contains
   a fix to correctly carry type annotations: `let%lwt x : t = … in …'
   now produces code that correctly place the `t' annotation. (This was
   caused by a change in ppxlib which was not accounted for previously.)

  Versions 6.0.0 and 5.9.2 or lwt_ppx are marked as `avoid-version' in
  opam-repository. They are fine to use as long as you don't use type
  annotations but you should update to 6.1.0 or 5.9.3.

  Special thanks to @Halbaroth for the bug report.
